Re “Battle Brewing Over Regulating Cryptocurrency” (front page, May 10):

Cryptocurrency’s race ahead of regulation exemplifies the pace at which the technologically feasible becomes the inexorable.

While lobbyists for Ripple Labs and other cryptocurrency purveyors are busy fending off oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission here in the United States, too little attention is being given to the industry’s astounding impact on our global environment.

As Bill Gates told The New York Times, “Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind.” The power consumed by that company alone exceeds the total electric demand of many countries.

But how can the global warming impacts of cryptocurrency be responsibly managed? With computer networks around the world churning out the necessary data, country-by-country regulations will fall woefully short of controlling the greenhouse gas emissions generated by cryptocurrency.
