I understand that readers and traders want to have more clarity on the direction Bitcoin will go, but ultimately, we need price to complete the next phase of this process. It all hinges on the current $27,800 support level right now. As long as that support level holds, then there is a very strong possibility that another upside price rally will begin at some point in the future. If it is broken and the Flag Breakdown continues, then it would appear the Excess Phase Top has moved into Phase #3 and will likely continue to unfold.

One of our Best Asset Now Hotlist ETFs has grown by 23.55% since we identified its trigger a short 9 days. Some of our subscribers that traded options on that BAN Hotlist trigger did really, really well!
