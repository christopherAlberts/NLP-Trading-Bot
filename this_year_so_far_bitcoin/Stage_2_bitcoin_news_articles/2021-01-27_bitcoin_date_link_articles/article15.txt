SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci said Wednesday that retail investor-led stock surges for video gaming firm GameStop suggest bitcoin will ultimately be a success.

On Tuesday, a volatile trading session largely driven by a campaign by members of the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets saw GameStop (NYSE: GME) jump 92.7%. Trading of the stock has been halted multiple times in the last week as price spikes triggered market protections.

After Elon Musk joined the fray, tweeting “GameStonks,” shares rose 50%. The video gaming stock is now worth $10 billion and classified as a large-cap stock, according to Bloomberg.

Scaramucci said in an interview with Bloomberg that this strong individual trader market action is “proof of concept that [b]itcoin is going to work,” and should be taken “seriously.”

He suggested the “decentralized” investor activity is similar to the fundamental concept behind bitcoin, while mobile-based and low-cost trading are “democratizing” formerly insular markets.

“How are you going to beat that decentralized crowd? That to me is more affirmation about decentralized finance,” Scaramucci said.
