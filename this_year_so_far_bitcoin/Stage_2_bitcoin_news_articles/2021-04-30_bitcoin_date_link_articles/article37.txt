Per a Coinbase announcement today, the acquisition is part of its work to strengthen services for institutional clients. According to Greg Tusar, vice president of institutional products at Coinbase, high-quality data access is “essential for institutions assessing investments in crypto assets.”

“We’re excited to integrate skew’s data analytics platform with Coinbase Prime, allowing our customers to track cryptocurrency spot and derivatives markets in real-time,” Tusar said, per the announcement. “With skew, we’ll arm professional traders with dynamic, aggregated market data, presented in a highly actionable format, all within our market leading prime brokerage.”
