CRAZY RICH

You don’t have to be Pythagoras to understand this simple maths calculation: Ten years ago, if you’d bought one bitcoin for one dollar and kept it, it would now be worth $70,000. It’s a massive return on investment.

Of course, back in 2011, buying highly speculative and volatile cryptocurrencies was an enormous gamble.

But as Tom Steinfort reports, that’s no longer the case. Huge financial institutions like Visa and Mastercard, and even celebrated investors like Elon Musk, are now on board, giving legitimacy to the once-derided cryptocurrency sector.

In turn that’s encouraged the tech-boffins to invent even more “out there” ways to make a buck.

GREAT BRIGHT SHARK

There’s an often-repeated story in the music industry about how Amy Shark, 34, came from nowhere to become an overnight singing sensation.

Only problem, it’s rubbish.

The truth is she endured 15 years of heartbreaking rejection before being taken seriously by record companies. As she tells Sarah Abo, music executives were ruthless in their assessment of her talent.

They were convinced she’d never make it. But Shark is no quitter, and when she was finally able to prove them wrong, it was not only a source of great satisfaction, it also provided rich fodder for some truly memorable songs.
