This is the first paper that estimates the price determinants of Bitcoin in a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) framework using high-frequency data. Derived from a theoretical model, we structurally estimate Bitcoin transaction demand and speculative demand models using hourly data for 2013â€“21. In line with the theoretical hypothesis, our empirical results confirm that both the Bitcoin transaction demand and speculative demand have a statistically significant impact on the Bitcoin price formation. The Bitcoin price responds negatively to the Bitcoin velocity, whereas positive shocks to the aggregate Bitcoin stock, interest rate and size of the Bitcoin economy exercise an upward pressure on the Bitcoin price.
