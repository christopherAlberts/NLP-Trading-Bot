Other coins followed suit, crashing as much as two-third in the past couple of weeks. Reuters reported that this past Friday, both Bitcoin and Ethereum saw their biggest single-day falls since March 2020, when the pandemic began.“The digital currency market has plummeted from $2.2 trillion to just $1 trillion in the past few days.
