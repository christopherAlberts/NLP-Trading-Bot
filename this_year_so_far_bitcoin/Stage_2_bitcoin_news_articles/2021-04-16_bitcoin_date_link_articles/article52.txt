Data acquired by cryptocurrency trading simulator Crypto Parrot indicates that it took bitcoin just 12 years to hit the $1tn market capitalisation, the least time frame than four leading traditional assets.

Among the overviewed assets, Microsoft (MSFT) took almost half a century at 44 years to hit the $1tn valuations, representing 3.6 times more time than bitcoin. Apple (AAPL) required 42 years to hit the milestone, meaning bitcoin hit the mark 3.5 times faster than the electronics giant.

Elsewhere, it took Amazon (AMZN) 24 years to hit the $1tn in market capitalisation representing double the period than bitcoin. Lastly, bitcoin took at least 1.75 times faster to hit the $1tn market cap when compared to Google’s (GOOG) 21 years.

Bitcoin might surpass traditional asset’s in market cap

The report explores the nature of growth between bitcoin and the highlighted mainstream assets over the past year.

According to the research report: “Based on bitcoin’s recent market cap rate growth, the asset will potentially surpass the highlighted traditional assets’ value at some point in the future. Although the technology stocks have soared from last year, none has been able to outperform bitcoin.”

Furthermore, as bitcoin adoption becomes more mainstream, it can amass a higher market cap than the traditional assets.

In this line, the report notes that: “If bitcoin sustains the growth coupled with increased institutional adoption that will lower volatility, the market cap might surpass some mainstream assets. The achievement is possible considering the bitcoin market cap has exceeded other formidable players like Tesla.”
