Australians are being warned that the boom in cryptocurrency trading has been accompanied by the explosive growth of sophisticated scams targeting investors itching to get rich.

As Bitcoin reached an all-time high this week of $85,000 and leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase listed on the Nasdaq – marking a major milestone for digital currencies – the amount of money being lost to online scams has never been greater.
