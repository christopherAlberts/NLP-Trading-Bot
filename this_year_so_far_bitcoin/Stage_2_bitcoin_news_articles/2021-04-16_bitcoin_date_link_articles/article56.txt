Investing.com -- Bloomberg’s ‘Crypto Outlook’, a monthly edition on the state of cryptos, said that Bitocin can hit $400,000 by the end of Q4 2021. The report said “Money managers reluctant to cross the Rubicon and allocate at least a small portion of funds may be at risk as simply does more of the same, advancing in price amid unprecedented low interest rates and elevated equities.”

The flagship cryptocurrency hit a high of over $64,500 a day before crypto platform Coinbase listed on the stock markets and topped a valuation of $100 billion for a brief while.

As the pandemic has forced investors to look beyond traditional financial assets, Bitcoin has emerged as the most popular alternative.

However, around 4% out of 200 professional investors surveyed by Bank of America (NYSE: ) in their monthly Bank of America Fund Manager Survey say that Bitcoin is a bubble. They also said that Bitcoin is second on the list of most-crowded trades, after technology stocks. The monthly survey aggregates the thoughts of 200 institutional, mutual, and hedge fund managers around the world.

Around 10% of the managers said that they think Bitcoin will outperform in 2021. Bitcoin is up over 606% since April 30, 2020 when it closed at $8,624. As of this report Bitcoin is trading at $60,917.
