Trevor Lawrence is going to get paid this week — in crypto.

The presumptive No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL draft, almost surely headed to the Jacksonville Jaguars, has partnered with a global cryptocurrency investment app called Blockfolio and will place his signing bonus into an account with the company.

"When it comes to my crypto portfolio, I wanted a long-term partner in the space that I could trust," Lawrence said in a release.

Lawrence's portfolio includes mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. He's also invested in Solana, a lesser-known blockchain.

According to Spotrac, the signing bonus for this year's No. 1 pick is an estimated $22,630,055.

“Trevor Lawrence is the future of professional football and cryptocurrency is the future of money, so the partnership was a no-brainer,” said Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of Blockfolio.
