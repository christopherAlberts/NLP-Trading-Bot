BATON ROUGE, La. (WVUE) - Louisiana lawmakers in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives adopted a resolution officially praising Bitcoin and encouraging state and local governments to utilize the cryptocurrency.

The resolution, HR33, authored by Rep. Mark Wright (R), was passed on Wednesday, April 21, and signed by Speaker Clay Schexnayder (R) on Thursday, formally praising Bitcon’s “success in becoming the first decentralized trillion dollar asset,” and pushes for “state and local government to consider ways that could help them benefit from the increased use of this new technology.”

Bitcoin “could potentially replace gold as a monetary reserve,” the resolution states, adding that the digital currency has “proven to be a critical tool for citizens around the world to protect themselves from currency debasement.”

The House also specifically commended Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s founder, for his “contribution to economic security.”

The praise comes after Coinbase made a rousing debut on Wall Street the week before, with shares of the digital currency exchange rising as high as $429, briefly giving it a market value over $100 billion.
