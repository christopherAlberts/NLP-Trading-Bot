So let's assume you have some Bitcoin, how do you spend it? First and foremost, the person or business that you would like to pay with Bitcoin has to accept it. When you "send" Bitcoin to the other party, you're essentially sending a transaction request to the Bitcoin network. This network, made up of millions of computers, uses a blockchain and keeps records of every Bitcoin in existence, and transactions since the beginning of Bitcoin. The blockchain is like a giant ledger, or spreadsheet. In short, the blockchain verifies your balance, and it ensures that the Bitcoin you are trying to send hasn't been spent twice by you. Once the transaction is verified, the new balance is updated for both parties.
