The dollar hovered near multi-week lows versus major peers on Tuesday, weighed by subdued Treasury yields, as investors consolidated positions ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy decision this week.

That snapped a five-day losing streak that took the digital token to the cusp of $47,000, with losses accelerating amid worries about U.S. President Joe Biden's plan to raise capital gains taxes.

The dollar index , which tracks the U.S. currency against six peers, was little changed at 90.859 early in the Asian session, after dipping to the lowest since March 3 overnight at 90.679.

No change to policy is expected when the Federal Open Market Committee ends its two-day meeting on Wednesday, but the market will pay close attention to comments from Chairman Jerome Powell, who is likely to face questions over whether improving conditions warrant a withdrawal of monetary easing.

The dollar has fallen nearly 3% since late March as U.S. Treasury yields traded in narrow ranges after retreating from a 14-month high of 1.7760%, slashing the currency's yield appeal.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was around 1.58% on Tuesday, tracking sideways since sliding to a one-month low of 1.528% in the middle of this month.

The euro slipped 0.1% to $1.2078 , but remained close to the one-month high of $1.2117 reached Monday.

The commodity-linked Australian dollar, a barometer of risk appetite, eased 0.1% to $0.7791 , after a 0.7% rally overnight that took it just shy of a five-week peak.

The offshore Chinese yuan retreated 0.1% after rising to a seven-week top of 6.4710 per dollar on Monday.

The dollar added 0.1% to 108.18 yen , another haven currency, continuing its rise from the seven-week low of 107.48 reached Friday.
