NEW YORK, April 26, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitwats is now quickly emerging as the next big name in the world of crypto mining. The company’s three multi-algorithm miners BT, DBT, and GBT have already carved a niche in the market because of their ability to generate 100% return on investment within just one month. Another key attribute of these miners is their ease of operation.



The extraordinary profitability of the ASIC miners from Bitwats is because of their extremely high hash rates, which refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a Proof-of-Work blockchain. The three miners can be used for mining bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, and monero with the hash rates as mentioned below.

BTC (TH/s) LTC (GH/s) ETH (GH/s) XMR (MH/s) BT 360 60 3 3 DBT 750 130 7 7 GBT 2250 390 21 21



Based on figures mentioned above, monthly profit making potential of DBT and CBT units are summarized below.

DBT Miner: $7,500 (Bitcoin), $13,000 (Litecoin), $13,000 (Ethereum), and $15,000 (Monero)

GBT Miner: $22,500 (Bitcoin), $39,000 (Litecoin), $37,000 (Ethereum), and $45,000 (Monero)

While designing its crypto miners, Bitwats wanted to deliver products that can be used easily by all, including the small time crypto enthusiasts with little or no mining knowledge or experience. The products are delivered pre-configured, and customers just need to plug in and start making profits. To provide additional savings for its customers, Bitwats also offers its own mining pool with 0% fees for them.
