Bitcoin soared nearly 10% on Monday, after five straight days of losses, on reports that JPMorgan Chase is planning to offer a managed bitcoin fund.

The cryptocurrency had slumped almost a fifth from its all-time high hit earlier this month.

It was last up 9.5% at $53,792.0 after touching its lowest since early March on Sunday. Other major coins ethereum and XRP, which tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, were up around 7.7% and 20.4% respectively.
