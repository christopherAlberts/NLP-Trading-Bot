Monday 5/31

Even with the Memorial Day holiday, it is the deadline for the small businesses to apply for the latest round of the Paycheck Protection Program funding.

According to the Small Business Administration data as of May 23, more than $795 billion has been allocated to through over 11.6 billion loans since the rescue fund's inception in March 2020. Just a fraction of the $292 billion that Congress allocated to the rescue fund this year is left – most of which is reserved for financial lenders that serve underserved communities.

Businesses with fewer than 500 employees could receive as much as $10 million through the program and are required to spend at least 60% of the money on maintaining payroll in order for the government to forgive the full loan. The remaining 40% could be spent on operating costs such as mortgages, rent and utilities. Only businesses with 300 employees or fewer were eligible to receive a second loan, which was capped at $2 million.
