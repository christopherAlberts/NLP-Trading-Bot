More Than $13 Billion Worth of Ether Locked Into the Eth2 Deposit Contract

Ethereum users have added quite a bit of ether to the “Eth2 deposit contract,” as it’s called on Etherscan as 5,210,370 ETH has been deposited to-date. That’s $13.6 billion worth of ether locked into the Beacon Chain contract, which was invoked six months and three weeks ago.

At the time of writing, there’s more than a dozen 32 ETH-sized transactions waiting to be confirmed. In order for an individual to become a staking validator, 32 ether worth over $84k today is required. Dune Analytics statistics show the contract is 993.66% above the 524k threshold.

Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin got the contract party started on November 5, 2020, when he deposited 3,200 ETH into the contract according to Etherscan. At the time of deposit, Buterin’s initial spend cost around $1.3 million and today it’s worth over $8.3 million. In fact, many of the validators that deposited at that time, saw significant gains during the six months after the Beacon Chain launch.

Data from Dune Analytics further shows that out of the 108,461 transactions sent to the Eth2 deposit contract, there’s 27,100 unique depositors. Beaconcha.in/charts data shows as of May 30, approximately 152,261 validators are recorded.

Over a Million Ether Added to the Eth2 Contract Last Month
