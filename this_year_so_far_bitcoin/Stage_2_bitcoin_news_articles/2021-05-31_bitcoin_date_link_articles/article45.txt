Online safety experts have warned a bitcoin product available to kids in Australia is of little educational value, as it exploits a loophole in current laws to expose them to the volatile and unregulated world of cryptocurrencies.

‘Penny the Pig’ launched this year by Australian entrepreneur Andrew Birt, co-founder of education technology startup Strive, claims to be the world’s first bitcoin piggy bank.

It integrates with crypto wallets including Coinbase and Metamask, with the balance displayed to children on the piggy bank while parents use an accompanying app to schedule cryptocurrency payments and monitor the digital transactions of their children.

While Mr Birt said the piggy bank offers a way for kids to be introduced to bitcoin, experts have raised concerns about the product, which is sold online for $US149 ($192), given the volatility of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
