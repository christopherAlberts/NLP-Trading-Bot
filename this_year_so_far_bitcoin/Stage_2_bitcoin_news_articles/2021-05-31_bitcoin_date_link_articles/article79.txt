TORONTO, May 31, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fortress Technologies Inc. (TSX-V: FORT) (the "Company" or “Fortress”) announces the results of its operations for the first quarter and three months period ended March 31, 2021 (“Q1 2021”). The first quarter of the fiscal year constituted a strong start for the Company, with a net income of approximately $3,700,000 which translates to an earnings per share of $0.05. This period also marked the beginning of a new venture with Great American Mining LLC (“GAM”).



The Company realizes the importance of environmental, social and governance ("ESG") initiatives. As such, the Company has entered into a new partnership with GAM, which specializes in developing and operating environmentally sustainable Bitcoin mining containers which convert vented/flared natural gas into electricity, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions.

The Company has commissioned and paid for 12 containers in its strategic venture with GAM, which are currently under production, and these will operate 2,160 new generation ASIC miners.

The first of twelve containers has been built and is currently being populated with 180 MicroBT ASIC miners, and is expected to be deployed and hashing in the gas fields in the first week of June 2021. This will bring the Company’s total operating Bitcoin mining hashrate to approximately 31 PH/s.

As of May 31, 2021, after the acquisition of the 12 GAM containers and the 180 MicroBT ASIC miners, the Company holds fiat and digital currencies of approximately $21,900,000, including 56.2 Bitcoin.

Production of the subsequent containers is underway. The Company is fully funded to acquire the remaining 1,980 ASIC miners for the remaining 11 containers; Fortress is strategically evaluating opportunities at an attractive $/TH rate, to seek a good return on capital invested. These remaining containers would produce an additional 130-180 PH/s of Bitcoin mining hashrate, in addition to the company’s existing capacity. Upon the deployment of all 12 containers and ASICs, the Company will retain a strong working capital balance for further business opportunities.

Fortress reports the following financial results on its operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

Fortress has mined 11.70 Bitcoin for the three months ended March 31, 2021;

Operating costs include monthly cash operating expenses, as well as incidental or accrued expenses. Depreciation, being a non-cash cost, is not deducted to arrive at the gross mining margin. Gross mining margin is a non-standard measure of mining efficiency and should not be considered as a substitute for other IFRS operating and profitability measures of performance.
