Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase said Thursday that it will begin trading on April 14, after receiving regulatory clearance for its direct listing from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The company, ranked No. 10 on the 2018 CNBC Disruptor 50 list, published a short blog post announcing the SEC's approval. While companies like Roblox, Spotify, Slack and Palantir previously went public through direct listings on the New York Stock Exchange, Coinbase will be the Nasdaq's first major direct listing.

The company has said it plans to register nearly 115 million shares of Class A common stock, which will trade under ticker symbol COIN. In a direct listing, the issuing company forgoes selling new stock and instead allows existing stakeholders to sell their shares to new investors.
