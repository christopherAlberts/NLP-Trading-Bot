A Surrey-based computer scientist who claims he is the true creator of Bitcoin is taking website Bitcoin.org to court in London over claims of copyright infringement.

Dr Craig Wright, who says he used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto to publish an academic paper in 2008 which laid the foundations for cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has kicked off legal proceedings against Cøbra, which operates and is the publisher of the website Bitcoin.org.

The case centres around Bitcoin.org's decision to publish the academic paper on its website.

Dr Wright's lawyers, Ontier LLP, said they had previously informed Cøbra that it was infringing Dr Wright's copyright and requested that the paper was removed.

Elsewhere, second-hand CD and DVD website MusicMagpie has started trading on Aim, netting founders Steve Oliver and Walter Gleeson a total of £22.5m.
