So we WAIT. No predictions, no hunches, no opinions. Bitcoin either aligns with the strategy, or we don’t assume any risk. As many “gurus” will not tell you (because they are too busy putting out “action”), high quality opportunities and setups are infrequent and RARE. Over a one month period we have only been seeing maybe 2 or 3 at most in recent months on the swing trade time frame. That translates to maybe 1 per week. More trades than that? You are either over trading or day trading.

IF the 50K support breaks, it can lead to a test of the 48K to 45K area quickly. This scenario will also put a lot of pressure on many of the overly hyped alt coins as well. Keep in mind, risk should be your first priority, not profits. With this philosophy in mind, if 50K breaks, and you have a lot of exposure to alts, it may be a good idea to lighten up even if it means absorbing a smaller loss along the way. Going into “HOPE MODE” is not a strategy, nor is it healthy for your account over the long run. Hype and the herd mentality have been at euphoric levels recently, and when the space goes out of favor, many will be stuck in coins that are not worth anything even close to what they paid for them.
