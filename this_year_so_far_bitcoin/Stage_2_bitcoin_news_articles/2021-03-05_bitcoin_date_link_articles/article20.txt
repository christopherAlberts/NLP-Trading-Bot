The public can now register their interest to receive Covid-19 vaccination through two more avenues â€“ the Special Committee on Covid-19 Vaccine Supply Access Guarantee (JKJAV) official website and a hotline.To register on the JKJAV website, look for the banner that says "Register For Your Vaccination Today". The website states that applicants will receive a confirmation notice via SMS within 24 hours.JKJAV, which made the announcement on Twitter today (March 5), said alternatively the public could also call the National Covid-19 Registration Vaccination Line at 1800-888-828.Those calling the hotline will be asked to select Bahasa Malaysia or English as the language option before the call is transferred to an agent for registration.Applicants will be asked to provide details such as name, phone number, email address and history of comorbidities.JKJAV advised applicants who already have MySejahtera to register via the app.Apart from online registration, hotline and MySejahtera app, applicants will also be allowed to register at public or private healthcare facilities and outreach programmes at rural or interior areas though the details will only be announced later.According to the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme guide, applicants will receive appointment details through the MySejahtera app, phone call or SMS.Malaysia is currently undergoing Phase 1 of the Covid-19 Immunisation Programme which targets 500,000 frontliners.
