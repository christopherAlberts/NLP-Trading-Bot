Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s post about his pet goats Max and Bitcoin on May 11 received swift reaction from memesters.

The photo post which shows two of Zuckerberg’s pet goats and simply captioned: “My goats: Max and Bitcoin.” till the writing of this story generated more than 480,000 likes, 96,000 comments and 10,000 shares on the platform.

Top comments under the post joked about the possibility of Zuckerberg “selling 1 Bitcoin” while others began commenting on the value of Bitcoin at the time of the tech mogul’s post. Other comments included memes featuring one users’ own goats – purportedly named “Max and Ethereum”; another bemoaned the absence of “Dodgecoin” among Zuckerberg’s pets.

Besides the positive and joke-y responses, some morbid users also recalled Zuckerberg’s “personal challenge” to only eat meat he had killed himself and queried about Max and Bitcoin’s futures. Others “advised” the founder to “concentrate” on fixing Facebook and Instagram bugs instead.

The comments were also flooded with other non-related, but equally meme-worthy and bizarre goat related stories – which were generating interactions among users themselves.

It is yet to be seen if Zuckerberg’s post initiates a “buying frenzy” in the actual cryptocurrency similar to Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk’s direct and oblique Twitter references to fellow crypto Dogecoin has done on and off since February this year.

One Bitcoin was priced at $54,955 as of 3:09 am UTC on May 11, as per data from Morningstar for Currency and Coinbase for Cryptocurrency.
