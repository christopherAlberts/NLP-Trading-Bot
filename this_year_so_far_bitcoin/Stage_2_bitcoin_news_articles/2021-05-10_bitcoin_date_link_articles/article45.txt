Rebranded to Marathon Digital Holdings, reflecting the Company’s position as a leading digital asset technology company

Strengthened management team by appointing Fred Thiel to chief executive officer as Merrick Okamoto remained executive chairman of the board of directors

Became the first North American enterprise Bitcoin miner to produce Bitcoin in a manner that adheres to anti-money laundering (AML) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control’s (OFAC’s) standards by directing all of the Company’s hashrate to the Marathon OFAC Pool

Management Commentary

“As our financial and operational results for the first quarter demonstrate, 2021 is lining up to be a banner year for Marathon as we are transforming our business into one of the largest enterprise Bitcoin mining operations in North America during what is currently one of the most profitable mining environments in Bitcoin’s history,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s CEO. “Since the start of 2021, we have taken several steps to establish Marathon as one of the leading pure-play Bitcoin investment opportunities by increasing our hashrate over 689%, rebranding our organization, and increasing our total bitcoin holdings to over 5,324 bitcoins. We have continued to build on that leadership position by becoming the first Bitcoin miner to produce bitcoin that is fully compliant anti-money laundering laws and OFAC’s standards by directing all of our hashrate to the Marathon OFAC Pool. With new miners being delivered and installed every day, we remain on track to achieve 10.37 EH/s by early 2022, and we look forward to continuing to scale the business for the betterment of our shareholders and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem in the coming quarters.”

Marathon’s chief financial officer, Sim Salzman, commented, “The first quarter marked a substantial improvement in our financial performance as we grew revenues to $9.2 million, generated net income of $83.4 million, and earned $137.4 million in adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, we exited the quarter with $211.9 million in cash and with a total liquidity, defined as cash and bitcoin holdings, of approximately $504.5 million. While Bitcoin’s future price and the network difficulty rate are subject to change, we believe Marathon’s financial performance will continue to improve as more miners come online, increasing our ability to generate revenues and yielding better economies of scale, which will drive profitability.”

First Quarter 2021 Financial Results

Total revenue increased 1,445% to $9.2 million in the first quarter of 2021 from $592,000 million in the first quarter of 2020.

Operating loss was $47.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to an operating loss of $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, operating expenses included $54 million of non-cash items, including $52.1 million in non-cash compensation and $662,000 impairment of cryptocurrencies. Excluding non-cash items, operating gain in the first quarter of 2021 was $6.9 million.

Net income in the first quarter of 2021 totaled $83.4 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $1.1 million or $(0.12) per diluted share in the first quarter of 2020. The improvement in net income was primarily attributable to a $132 million unrealized gain from the change in value of Marathon’s $150 million Bitcoin investment via a fund-of-one made in January 2021.

Marathon previously generated net operating loss (NOL) carry-forwards for federal and state purposes of approximately $45.6 million and $27.2 million, respectively. As a result, the Company did not owe corporate income taxes as of March 31, 2021.

Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2021 was $137.4 million, compared to an adjusted EBTIDA loss of $479,000 in the first quarter of 2020.

In the first quarter of 2021, the Company generated 192 bitcoins. The Company last sold bitcoin on October 21, 2020, and since then, has been accumulating or “hodling” all bitcoin generated. The Company supports the blockchain development by sponsoring one of the developers in the form of a monthly grant paid using its mined bitcoin. As of March 31, 2021, the Company held approximately 5,129.8 bitcoins, including the 4,813 bitcoins the Company purchased for an average price of $31,168 by investing $150 million into a fund-of-one.

Marathon’s Digital Assets

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2021, the carrying value of Marathon’s digital assets (comprised solely of bitcoin) was $292.6 million, which reflects cumulative impairment charges of $662k since acquisition. Marathon accounts for its digital assets as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, they are measured at cost, net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition. Marathon determines the fair value of its bitcoin based on quoted (unadjusted) prices on the active exchange that Marathon has determined is its principal market for bitcoin. Marathon considers the lowest price of one bitcoin quoted on the active exchange at any time since acquiring the specific bitcoin. If the carrying value of a bitcoin exceeds that lowest price, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to that bitcoin in the amount equal to the difference between its carrying value and such lowest price. Impairment losses are recognized as “Impairment of cryptocurrencies” in Marathon’s Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations.

As of March 31, 2021, the average cost and average carrying value of Marathon’s mined bitcoins were approximately $36,014 and $33,926, respectively. As of May 6, 2021, at 6 p.m. EST, Marathon held approximately 5,324 bitcoins, of which 4,813 are held in an investment fund of one while the other 511 were generated by the Company’s operations. The market price of one bitcoin in the principal market on May 6, 2021 was approximately $56,135, and the approximate value of the bitcoins the Company has invested in and held as digital currencies was therefore over $503.2 million (*unaudited).

Investor Notice

Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and forward-looking statements described under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.

Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. In addition, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results in the future. Future changes in the network-wide mining difficulty rate or Bitcoin hashrate may also materially affect the future performance of Marathon's production of Bitcoin. Additionally, all discussions of financial metrics assume mining difficulty rates as of May 2021. See "Safe Harbor" below.
