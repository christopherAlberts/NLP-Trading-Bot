To address concerns over the expanded carbon footprint of energy-intensive bitcoin mining activity, Ninepoint has entered into partnerships with CarbonX, which provides carbon emission analysis and carbon offsetting services through its Zerofootprint brand, and The Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute, a leader in providing scientific estimates for the energy consumption and environmental impact of cryptocurrencies.

Through the partnerships, Ninepoint said the fund will be subject to carbon footprint analysis and provided with carbon offsets from projects that meet the highest global standards. Under the arrangement, Ninepoint said it is supporting various forest conservation projects that create direct positive impacts in the Amazon by avoiding the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and contributing to the United Nations’ sustainable development goals.

Ninepoint added that it will be shouldering all costs of offsetting the fund’s carbon footprint, which it will pay out of its management fee and not pass on to unitholders of the fund.

“Bitcoin is both a rapidly growing asset class and increasingly important financial technology. We must all do our part to ensure Bitcoin grows in a more sustainable way,” said Alex Tapscott, managing director of Digital Assets at Ninepoint. “Ninepoint is showing the world one way to do that.”

Meanwhile, Evolve ETFs has debuted the Evolve CleanBeta series of ETFs, which are the first in the world to offer carbon-neutral exposure to traditional equity indices.
