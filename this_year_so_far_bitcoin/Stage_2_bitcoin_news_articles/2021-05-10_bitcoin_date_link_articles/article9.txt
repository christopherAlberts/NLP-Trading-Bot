Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady seems to be excited about investing in cryptocurrency.

He posted a new profile picture to get in on what seems to be the “Laser Eyes effect,” which is a common expression among Bitcoin investors who are laser-focused on holding — and keeping their profile with the laser eyes — until it is worth $100,000.

Brady has never publicly addressed whether he is investing in cryptocurrency, though this would be a strong indicator. He did, however, address a Twitter user suggesting, “Rumor has it @TomBrady is loading up on Bitcoin.”

The Buccaneers quarterback also recently purchased a boat worth $6 million. It seems money is flowing in the Brady-Bundchen household.

Hmmmm should I change it?? https://t.co/w6VF35Ypgx — Tom Brady (@TomBrady) May 10, 2021
