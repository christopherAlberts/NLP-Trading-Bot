Last week, reports stated that Bitcoin is expected to eventually reach $1 million USD. Now, cryptocurrency custody firm NYDIG has stated that select banks in the U.S. will allow you to buy, hold and sell Bitcoin.

According to a statement acquired by CNBC, “hundreds of banks are already enrolled in the program” thanks to the partnership between NYDIG and fintech expert Fidelity National Information Services. Meanwhile, smaller institutions like California-based community bank Suncrest has already agreed to participate. “What we’re doing is making it simple for everyday Americans and corporations to be able to buy Bitcoin through their existing bank relationships,” said Patrick Sells, head of bank solutions at NYDIG. “If I’m using my mobile application to do all of my banking, now I have the ability to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin.”

As of now Fidelity National Information Services will handle the link to lenders, while NYDIG will be in charge of Bitcoin custody and trade execution. Stay tuned as we wait for more details to surface.
