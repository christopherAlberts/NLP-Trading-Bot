KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Sean Culkin won't be converting his NFL salary to Bitcoin after all. At least not a salary that Culkin would draw from the Kansas City Chiefs.

Culkin, who recently attracted attention for his plan to be the first NFL player to convert 100% of his paycheck to cryptocurrency, was released by the Chiefs on Monday. Culkin was trying to earn a job with the Chiefs as a backup tight end behind starter Travis Kelce.

But the Chiefs signed veteran Blake Bell in free agency and then drafted another tight end, Noah Gray of Duke, in the fifth round.

Had he made the Chiefs, Culkin would have received a salary of $920,000 from the Chiefs in U.S. dollars. Culkin then planned to convert the money into Bitcoin.

The Chiefs also released backup offensive lineman Bryan Witzmann and waived quarterback Jordan Ta'amu on Monday.
