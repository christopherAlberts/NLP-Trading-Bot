BTC/USD

Yesterday morning, buyers continued the recovery of the BTC/USD pair, but during the day the bulls repeatedly ran into bearish impulses, which brought the price down to the support around the $53,300 mark.

By the end of the day, the pair came close to the target level of $55,000. However, it was possible to break through this resistance only this evening. The March high was set at $55,855 and, in the morning, the Bitcoin price returned to the support of $53,300. If sellers' efforts are limited today by this support, then buyers will try to restore the price to the zone of the monthly maximum.

If the bears push below the $53,300 mark, then the price may retrace to the two-hour EMA55 area.

Tonight there was a weak attempt by the bulls to test the level of $1,900, but the growth was not supported by large enough volumes. After a local maximum of around $1,880, the price rolled back to the POC line ($1,768). If the bears push through this Volume Profile indicator line, then the pair will test the two-hour moving average EMA55.

If the point of control line stops the onslaught of sellers, then in small volumes the price will resume the sideways consolidation with support at $1,800.

XRP was trading at low volumes yesterday, and buyers were unsuccessful in the price recovery.

The bears broke through the four-hour EMA55 tonight and are trying to test the support of $0.450. If the upper border of the channel cannot withstand the onslaught of sellers, the pair will return to a narrow sideways trend with support at $0.430. At the same time, low selling volumes will help ease the bearish onslaught and restore the pair above average prices.
