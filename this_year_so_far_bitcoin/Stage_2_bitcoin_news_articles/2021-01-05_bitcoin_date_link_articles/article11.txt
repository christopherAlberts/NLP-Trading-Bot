TORONTO, Jan. 05, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ninepoint Partners LP (“Ninepoint”) is pleased to announce that Bitcoin Trust (the “Fund”) has filed a preliminary prospectus in connection with its offering (the “Offering”) of Class A Units (“Class A Units”), Class F Units (“Class F Units”) and/or Class S Units (“Class S Units” and, together with the Class A Units and Class F Units, the “Units”). A receipt for the preliminary prospectus has been issued by the securities regulatory authorities in each of the provinces and territories of Canada. The Units are being offered at a price per Unit of US$10.00 (or the equivalent in Canadian dollars).



Investment Objectives

The Fund’s investment objectives are to seek to provide holders of Units (“Unitholders”) of the Fund with exposure to digital currency bitcoin (“Bitcoin”) through an institutional-quality platform that is cost-efficient to Unitholders and to provide a secure, simpler and exchange-traded investment alternative for buying and holding Bitcoin.

Investment Strategies and Fund Highlights

The Fund intends to achieve its investment objectives by investing directly in Bitcoin while using high quality service providers, including digital asset trading counterparties, trading platforms and custodians, and independent auditors, legal and valuation agents, in order to manage the assets of the Fund. By having in-house expertise, through Ninepoint’s recently formed Digital Asset Group, Ninepoint expects to offer a cost-efficient structure to Unitholders for ongoing management fees.

Ninepoint believes that the Fund will have the lowest management fee structure for a listed Bitcoin vehicle in Canada. An annual management fee of 0.70% of the Fund’s net asset value, calculated daily and payable monthly in arrears, plus applicable taxes, will be paid to Ninepoint in respect of each of the Class A Units, the Class F Units and the Class S Units of the Fund.

The Fund’s Bitcoin will be valued based on the MVIS CryptoCompare Institutional Bitcoin Index maintained by MV Index Solutions GmbH (“MVIS”), or a successor or alternative institutional-quality index. MVIS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Van Eck Associates Corporation, a large, long-standing, and well-regarded financial services firm.

Ninepoint will act as trustee and manager of the Fund.

“We are pleased to bring Bitcoin Trust to market. We believe our investment structure will provide investors a convenient, safe and cost-efficient way to gain exposure to Bitcoin,” said Alex Tapscott, Managing Director of Ninepoint’s Digital Asset Group.

James Fox, Co-CEO of Ninepoint added, “On behalf of Ninepoint Partners, we are excited to provide both institutional and retail investors access to Bitcoin in an institutional-quality platform.”

Agents

The offering is being conducted by a syndicate of agents led by Canaccord Genuity Corp. and INFOR Financial Inc. and including Echelon Wealth Partners Inc., PI Financial Corp., Richardson Wealth Limited, Leede Jones Gable Inc., Mackie Research Capital Corporation and Sightline Wealth Management LP.

A preliminary prospectus containing important information relating to these securities has been filed with securities commissions or similar authorities in each of the provinces and territories of Canada. The preliminary prospectus is still subject to completion or amendment. Copies of the preliminary prospectus may be obtained from one of the dealers noted above. There will not be any sale or any acceptance of an offer to buy the securities until a receipt for the final prospectus has been issued.
