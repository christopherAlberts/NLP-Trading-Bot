The future is now. Or at least, the future is June.

That's when Beatport, the electronic music store for DJs, producers and dance fans, will start accepting payments in Bitcoin in addition to dollars. This development will make the online store the first major digital music retailer to accept Bitcoin, which currently trade for more than $55,000 apiece.

And you guessed it, NFTs are also involved. On April 23 the platform will launch a non-fungible token called Music for Future Dance Floors, a 10-track compilation featuring contributions from Boys Noize, Charlotte de Witte, Sama' Abdulhadi and Sasha.
