They’ve recently just reached #7 on the BitClout leaderboards as they’re now worth $4.5 million. This makes them the only account on BitClout’s top 10 list that doesn’t have a blue-tick verification.

What is BitClout?

It’s the influencer stock market — a decentralized Twitter where user reputation is pegged to a dollar amount. It allows users to have their own unique coin that can grow in value when people buy it.

Celebrities such as Jake Paul, Paul Pogba, and Grant Cardone already have their coin valued at thousands — higher than most cryptocurrencies.

But without an exchange, $10,000 in BitClout is the equivalent to $10,000 typed on a calculator. It means nothing.

This is why WithdrawBitClout’s market cap is growing in millions by the minute. It’s the final piece of the BitClout puzzle.

More About WithdrawBitClout

It was founded by Marion Awfal, an established BitClout user who’s worth over $11,000 on the platform. His team consists of active Bitclout users who are trusted also.

Transparency is a top priority on WithdrawBitClout so everyone has a consistently safe and decentralized experience.

What’s even better is there incredibly low fees — 2% from buyers and sellers.

Many exchanges bait users into their platform through low trading fees but exploit them with deposit and withdrawal fees. WithdrawBitClout isn’t one of these exchanges.

Its peer-to-peer nature makes it impossible for them to take advantage of their users.
