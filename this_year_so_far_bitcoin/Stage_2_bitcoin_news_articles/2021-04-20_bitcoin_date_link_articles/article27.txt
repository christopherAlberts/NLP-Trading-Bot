All Transactions Will Be Settled in Doge Via Bitpay

Miami, Fla. --News Direct-- D8 Holdings, Inc.

D8 Holdings, Inc., the market leader in hemp-derived Delta-8 THC—today announced it will start accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin as payment methods on their site.

“Our customers are early adopters, many of whom are heavily involved in the crypto market,” said Chris Duffield, CEO of D8. “With $2 trillion dollars sitting in crypto assets, and $45 billion parked in Dogecoin, the ability to accept crypto currency presents a big opportunity for our company.”

D8.co will integrate Bitpay into their online platform, and all transactions will be settled in Doge. With the click of a button, customers can trade Doge for delta-8 gummies, delta-8 carts and delta-8 disposables as long as they are over 21 years of age.

“Anyone paying with crypto will get a free pack of Delta-8 gummies as a bonus. We are looking long-term, and don’t plan on selling a single Doge,” concluded Duffield.
