Stimulus money in the pandemic has been a major factor behind the current boom in stocks and cryptocurrencies.

In 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Act provided payments of $1,200 for eligible adults and another $500 for those with qualifying children.

The CARES Act was the first of three rounds of stimulus payments for Americans since March 2020.

The Tax Relief Act of 2020 in December declared additional payments of $600 per eligible adult and up to $600 for those with qualifying children.

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 last month provided an additional $1,400 payment to eligible adults and up to $1,400 for those with qualifying children.

Some consumers used the stimulus payments to help with increased expenses or lower income due to the pandemic. Others saved the money or invested it.

Here is a look at the return a consumer would have had if they put their stimulus checks into leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum on the dates of April 11, 2020; December 29, 2020; and March 12, 2021.

The calculations are based on the stimulus payments of $1,200, $600 and $1,400 for eligible adults by using the highest price each cryptocurrency traded for on the dates Americans began receiving checks.
