Asian shares hit a one-month high on Monday helped by expectations monetary policy will remain accommodative the world over, while COVID-19 vaccine rollouts help ease fears of another dangerous wave of coronavirus infections.

Indicators were positive for Europe as well with futures for Eurostoxx 50 up 0.2% and Germany's DAX adding 0.1% though those for London's FTSE were barely changed.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) went as high as 699.70, a level not seen since March 18. It was last up 0.1% at 696.46.

The index jumped 1.2% last week and is up 5.1% so far this year, on track for its third straight yearly gain.

"The extremely supportive monetary and fiscal policy setting continues to provide a fertile environment for risk assets," said Rodrigo Catril, senior forex strategist at National Australia Bank.

Australian shares (.AXJO) finished unchanged from Friday's close while New Zealand's benchmark index (.NZ50) gained 0.6% and South Korea's KOSPI (.KS11) added 0.1%. Japan's Nikkei (.N225) turned around its losses to end flat.

Chinese shares, which started in negative territory, recouped losses with the blue-chip index (.CSI300) up 2.2%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.6%.

On Friday, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 0.4% to close at a new record high while clocking its sixth straight weekly gain. The Dow (.DJI) finished 0.5%, also at a record high while the Nasdaq (.IXIC) climbed 0.1%.

The gains are unlikely to extend further with e-mini futures for the S&P 500 down 0.2%.

This week is off to a quiet start with no major data releases slated on Monday.

In currencies, the U.S. dollar loitered near a four-week low against a basket of currencies as investors increasingly bought into the Federal Reserve's insistence it would keep an accommodative policy stance for a while longer.
