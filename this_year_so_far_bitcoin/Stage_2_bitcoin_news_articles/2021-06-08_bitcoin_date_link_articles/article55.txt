After a busy few days of plotting to dismantle the global financial power structures, crowds from the Miami Bitcoin convention hit the clubs over the weekend.

On Saturday rapper G-Eazy performed at E11EVEN in front of a crowd that included Twitter’s Jack Dorsey and Snapchat’s Evan Spiegel. The club — the first major nightlife venue to accept cryptocurrency — has been packed all week in light of the 20,000-plus attendee convention, we’re told.

A source tells us the venue even pulled in over six figures in crypto in the past few days.

Also in the crowd was Logan Paul’s brother Jake Paul, who was in town to see his bro take on Floyd Mayweather in an exhibition match. A spy tells us that controversial Jake — who made his name with prank videos on YouTube — was not drinking because he is also training as a boxer. (He recently told Bloomberg, “It’s such an art, and I’m an artist … I love the feeling of cracking people in the face or the body.”)

And nearby, former basketball star Dennis Rodman “was hanging like a regular guy at the bar,” except that “girls and guys were begging to take photos.”

Later in the night, Deadmau5 took the stage. We hear the electronic musician even ditched the mouse head helmet he normally wears to get on stage and twirl around a go-go dancer pole.

Rapper Lil Baby, Marshmello, and Larsa Pippen were also in the crowd.

Earlier in the week, Paris Hilton kicked off the Bitcoin Convention — which featured talks from Dorsey, Ron Paul and Tony Hawk — with a DJ set at the club for a crowd of techies who paid up to $25,000 for a table.
