Greetings from an overcast Z√ºrich where I will be taking part ‚Äì in person ‚Äì on a panel ‚ÄúWhat the Media Thinks about Digital Assets & Blockchain‚Äù which is obviously a wide-ranging topic where I can underscore the importance of remaining agnostic in our nascent industry.

For those of you following my recent and rather challenging travel exploits, it was a miracle I actually made it! I‚Äôd also like to thank my friend Jimmy Nguyen of the Bitcoin Association for the invitation to take part and for respecting my independent views! Now I have to run to get some trousers as, being a right Donald, I forgot to pack any!

To watch this conference online you can register here ‚Äì my panel will be on Thursday, 10 June at 14:30 CSET

Crypto at a glance

Yesterday, we spoke of a sense of ‚Äòcalm before the storm‚Äô in the crypto markets. It seems that sense was indeed correct, though the simple joy of being right is somewhat negated by the double digit drops across the board.

Bitcoin has again found strong support at just above $32k this morning after dropping 10 per cent over the last 24 hours, while Ethereum (ETH) has also again managed to again bounce back at $2,500 following a similar fall in price. Will they be able to sustain another recovery?

It feels like a long time ago that Bitcoin was trading at around $60k, though it was actually less than a month ago now. But while recent price crashes have been defined by the surrounding FUD, this is somewhat remarkable in that it comes enveloped in rousing adoption news for Bitcoin and bullish fundamentals for Ethereum.

The president of El Salvador‚Äôs announcement over the weekend that Bitcoin would be considered legal tender in the Central American country has been followed by a number of politicians from other Latin American countries adding laser eyes to their Twitter profiles. The laser eyes meme is supposed to be an endorsement of the leading cryptocurrency, sparking rumour that more countries will follow El Salvador‚Äôs lead. Can the bombastic tweets of a wannabe space mogul really move the market more than adoption by a sovereign nation?

Yesterday also saw more bullishness when former US president Donald Trump gave a back-handed endorsement of Bitcoin, giving it apparently accidental credibility by describing his fears that it was a ‚Äúcurrency‚Äù that could rival the US dollar.

The latest dip took the overall market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined below $1.5 trillion for the first time since May, with Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA) and XRP (XRP) all also falling around 10 per cent over the last 24 hours. It seems that despite recent breakouts in the alt markets, they‚Äôre largely still in thrall to Bitcoin. Will they manage to decouple again?
