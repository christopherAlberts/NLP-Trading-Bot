CARLETON ENGLISH: Obviously, volatility has been a huge part of cryptocurrency trading. I get most of the questions on should I get in when Bitcoin is closer to 60,000 than when it's closer to 30,000? Or a few years ago, 10,000. Any advice for investors on stomaching that volatility?

MELTEM DEMIRORS: What I really encourage individuals in particular to think about is don't make a snap decision based on what someone on the internet said. Really spend some time and think about is this an asset I want to hold for the next 10 years in my portfolio? And if so, find avenues and channels to get exposure to that asset that work for you, and for your preferences, and your risk appetite.

There's a lot of ETFs and structured products that you can buy. Our [? XPT ?] provider product and Coinshare's physical products are traded throughout Europe and make it really easy for people to hold crypto in their brokerage accounts. So that's one option.

In the US and in Canada, there's obviously the three IQ coin shares, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs that we helped launch over the last few months. Those are also great ways to get exposure. You can buy crypto directly through a variety of platforms, whether your preference is for a Coinbase, which is a specialist in that, or for Fidelity, or a Square cash app or a PayPal.

A lot of different ways you can get exposure. And then obviously there are a lot of other platforms that are decentralized online marketplaces that are peer to peer where you can also engage. But obviously, that's going to have a bit of a higher learning curve, in terms of learning how to use those new platforms. A super fun journey to go on if you have the time and the interest in learning that.
