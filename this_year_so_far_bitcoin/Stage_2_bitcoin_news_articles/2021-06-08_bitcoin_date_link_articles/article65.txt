Meme Stocks and a New Form of Capitalism?

Cramer took to Real Money to break down his latest thoughts on AMC (AMC) - Get Report and GameStop (GME) - Get Report and his crusade to understand and support the mission of meme stock investors.

"I think we have to re-define this new form of capitalism for what it is: find a stock where the sellers are braindead or shorting the stock -- betting against it -- and blitz the stock higher in concert and simply run right over anyone who gets in your way," Cramer wrote.

All That Glitters Isn't Bitcoin?

Bitcoin's infallibility has come into question after the U.S. seized almost all of the ransom Colonial Pipeline paid to hacker group DarkSide.
