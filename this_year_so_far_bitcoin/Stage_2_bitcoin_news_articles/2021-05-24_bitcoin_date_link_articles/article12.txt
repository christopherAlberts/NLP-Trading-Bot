When 29-year-old Sam found out that his younger brother had made £30,000 trading bitcoin, he couldn’t believe what he was hearing. The self-employed musician decided to put the last £2,000 of his savings into various cryptocurrencies, hoping he could double his money. However, wild swings in crypto valuations are proving a test of his strategy. Presenter Claer Barrett explores the highs and lows of investing in cryptocurrencies with experts Abhishek Sachdev, a professional investor who has personally invested £20,000, and Eva Szalay, the FT’s currencies correspondent. They discuss crypto’s long-term potential as an asset class and the risks that investors such as Sam need to be aware of, as well as the allure of investing in highly volatile unregulated assets. Review clips: BBC Newsnight, CNBC.
