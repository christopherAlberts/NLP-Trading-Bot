Bitcoin (BTC) remained under pressure over the weekend as traders react to Chinaâ€™s latest news about tightening crypto regulation. The cryptocurrency is down about 36% month to date and was trading around $37,000 at the time of writing. Price recoveries should remain limited to $40,000 as the broader uptrend weakens.
