Video Transcript

- Let's bring in Todd Jablonski now-- he's the Chief Investment Officer at Principal Global Asset Allocation-- to talk a bit more about everything happening in the markets. And Todd, we were just chatting earlier about inflation and the conversation around transitory impacts, the magnitude of inflation increases, really outpacing where most people have expected them to go. How are you thinking about inflation at this point as we head into a period where we do expect to see a couple of jarring prints, especially after that April number we got a couple of weeks back?

TODD JABLONSKI: Well, inflation has gone from being on no one's radar screen maybe five years ago as a lead concern to now being at the absolute forefront as you see the economy rebound off of COVID lows. And the tremendous acceleration in earnings, coupled with massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, is enough to really cause liftoff on a variable that's been stuck at below 2% growth for some time. We actually welcome, I think, a bit of inflation coming to the US economic picture. And it's this surge that leads to print perhaps even clipping 3 and 1/2%, 4% in the shorter-term, though we do expect that to subside.

We think the real question is, yes, that will inform how cyclical exposures and other asset classes perform. But where do we settle post the surge? Is it more around that 2.75% or 3%? We're going to be watching the data to see just how permanent some of these inflation forces are and how they affect the capital market outlook.

- Well, whatever the case down the road, inflation is here right now. Are you guys hedging inflation at all in your positioning, Todd?

TODD JABLONSKI: Yeah, as we think about the impact of inflation on multi-asset portfolios here at Principle, we're pro-inflation. And we have tilted our portfolio towards a procyclical bias. We like, in particular, equities, small cap, value, credit, and diversified real assets as a way to actually ride the inflation wave rather than to really hedge against this negative effect. There are lots of asset classes that show that positive inflation data that we feel are appropriate for investors tactically today.

- Todd, you allocate money to various assets. Are you allocating any to crypto at this point? I mean, crypto has plunged across the board. Do you see any value there?

TODD JABLONSKI: We've spent a lot of time looking at crypto. And currently, we're not allocating client assets towards crypto mostly because I'd like to have, I think, a much better understanding of where that asset class aligns with investor demand with investor outcome. At one point in time, you had seen that cryptos were up towards the top of the tables in terms of asset class returns this year.

Here, we are checking in mid-May. And boy, the volatility really shows. When I think about a currency, I'm thinking for more stability than I get out of crypto. But I think it's important to instead realize how can you access some of the digital transformations without using crypto? And I think in a lot of areas, particularly in real estate and technology, there are ways to access similar forces with greater certainty.

- All right, we see the opening bell down on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Zip recruiter going public today in a direct listing. And we see the team from Zip Recruiter remotely ringing the bell this morning. Congratulations to the ubiquitous podcast sponsor out there for its debut on the market. And we're going to talk to Zip Recruiter CEO later on today on Yahoo Finance Live right around 12:15 or so.

Now, Todd, something else you flagged to us in our notes is that you're still in favor, or you still have a bias towards value in that value-to-growth rotation. Where do you think we are at within that cycle? It's been now a good seven months that value has really flexed here? Does it feel like its still at the beginning of that cycle, in the middle or the end? How are you thinking through that question?

TODD JABLONSKI: Yeah, I've been surprised at how quickly investors have been willing to declare victory with a small value rally and say that's what we can expect from this asset class. Instead, I point back to a decade's worth of significant underperformance of value relative to growth. And while we do believe that that mega-cap growth forest-- mega-cap tech growth forest remains in effect, this value rally, in our perspective, has a long opportunity to run.

And a steeper yield curve and accelerating inflation outlook and really strong financials, sorry, fundamentals, can really, we think, drive the results that say, lead value perhaps have an extended run. And let's see if perhaps this is more of a cycle that lasts multiple years as opposed to multiple months.

- All right, Todd Jablonski, chief investment officer at Principal Global Asset Allocation. Todd, thanks for jumping on this morning. Always great to get your thoughts.
