(Kitco News) As the crypto space sees wild price swings, Kevin O'Leary, chairman of O'Shares ETFs and star of Shark Tank, says he is very bullish on bitcoin, but there's one looming issue that needs to be solved before prices can head to $100k.

There is a heated debate around the sustainability and ESG aspects of bitcoin mining, and bitcoin will be "stuck in a rut" until this is resolved, O'Leary told Michelle Makori, editor-in-chief of Kitco News.

"For all the hype and excitement around crypto, institutions haven't really touched this yet. Not real institutions. Not the sovereign funds, not the pension plans," O'Leary said. "Less than 1% of global institutions and sovereign funds have anything to do with crypto in any way."

Institutions need to comply with sustainability and ethics committees, which are not okay with some bitcoin miners burning coal to mine the digital coins. "There are many miners, particularly in Asia and other foreign countries, that burn coal to mine bitcoin," O'Leary pointed out. This issue is not going away. But once solved, a massive wave of institutional money will flow into bitcoin. "If we can resolve this, we can open up the floodgate of institutional money that wants to allocate to bitcoin. As a bitcoin owner, I want the institutional buyer to be my incremental buyer. That way, I can see price appreciation," he said.

O' Leary also noted that the crypto puck is headed to DeFi. “It's a fantastic opportunity to deploy cash. You can't make any interest anymore with fiat. This is a way to do it. And yes, there's volatility, but this is where the capital is going to invest in. DeFi is an immense opportunity. And I certainly want to have a horse in that race.”

Yet, despite being "very bullish" on bitcoin and its future potential, O'Leary is keeping his 5% allocation to gold.
