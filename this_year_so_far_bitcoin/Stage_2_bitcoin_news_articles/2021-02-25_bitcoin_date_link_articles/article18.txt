CNBC-TV host Jim Cramer thinks videogame retailer GameStop (GME) – the firm at the heart of the recent WallStreetBets-led retail trading frenzy – should buy bitcoin.

With GameStop shares up by 100% and closing at $91.71 in the final hours of trading on Wednesday, Cramer tweeted: “GME–issue one billion dollars in stock, Buy one billion in bitcoin and watch your stock go to $430…”
