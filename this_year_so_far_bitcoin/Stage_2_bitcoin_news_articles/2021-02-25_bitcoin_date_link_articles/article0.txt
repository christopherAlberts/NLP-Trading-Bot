Bill Gates has long been sceptical about Bitcoin. In 2018 he said in an interview with CNBC that he would "short" it if he could. Short-selling, or shorting, refers to the practice of borrowing something (traditionally shares), selling them, waiting for the price to drop and then buying them back cheaper and returning them.
