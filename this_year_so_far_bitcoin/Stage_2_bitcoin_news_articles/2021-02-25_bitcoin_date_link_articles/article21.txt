Highlights Realme 8 series has been teased by the company

The lineup may include at least one model with a 108MP camera

Realme 8 series will come as successors to Realme 7 phones from last year

The Realme 8 series India launch has been teased on Twitter by the brand’s country head Madhav Sheth. The announcement comes just a day after the company unveiled the Narzo 30 Pro and Narzo 30A smartphones in the country. The cryptic tweet doesn’t explicitly mention Realme 8 but the #InfiniteLeapWith8 makes us believe that the top executive is indeed hinting at the Realme 7 successor. The tweet also reads “Do you guys know what 108 stands for?” and the poster image attached has a mention of 108. This is a pretty obvious hint at the Realme 8 series featuring at least one model with a 108MP camera. Sheth says the company will share more details tomorrow, so we won’t have to wait much longer to learn more about the Realme 8 series.

A great breakthrough ahead!

Realme 8 specifications

MediaTek Dimensity 720 SoC

8GB RAM

Android 10

65W charging

Realme 8 specifications had been leaked recently as the smartphone recently appeared on the Geekbench V4.4 platform with model number RMX3092. The listing revealed the phone will come with the octa-core MediaTek Dimensity 720 chipset clocked at 2GHz, making it one of the most affordable 5G offerings in the country when launched. Realme 8 is said to pack 8GB RAM and boot Android 10 OS, but it may have the newer Android 11 at launch. China’s 3C certification suggested it will come with 65W fast-charging support. Considering Realme’s focus on 5G, we can speculate one of the Realme 8 series models could have the latest network connectivity.

Realme 8 had also bagged BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) certification but failed to reveal much else about the phone. Realme 8 series could have more than one variant as, historically, the lineup includes a vanilla model and a Pro variant. The latter usually comes with high-end specifications, while the former is priced aggressively.
