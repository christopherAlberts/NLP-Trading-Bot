The monthly adjusted on-chain volume for Bitcoin was the highest it’s ever been in March, according to data compiled by The Block Research.

March’s adjusted on-chain volume was $366.27 billion — up 14.7% from February’s previous all-time high of $319.3 billion. March also marks the third consecutive month in which adjusted on-chain volume for Bitcoin reached record highs.

Indeed, data collected by The Block points to a busy March overall.

That same month, bitcoin miners brought in more than $1.5 billion in revenue -- a development fueled by bitcoin hitting record-high prices across the world's global exchange ecosystem.

Trading volumes for bitcoin futures and options also hit record highs last month, as previously reported.
