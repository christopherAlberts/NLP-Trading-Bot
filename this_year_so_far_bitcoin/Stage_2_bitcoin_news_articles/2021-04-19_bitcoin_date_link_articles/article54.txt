Crypto at a glance

A rough weekend for leading cryptocurrencies saw the total market cap plunge below $2 trillion on Sunday for the first time in just over a week, though a recovery overnight has seen many come charging back. Can they now pick up where they left off last week?

The weekend‚Äôs antics were led by a huge fall for Bitcoin, which plunged 15 per cent in a single day yesterday to around $52,000. That represents a fall of more than $12,000 from last Wednesday‚Äôs all-time high of almost $65,000.

The drop comes off the bat of last week‚Äôs Coinbase listing, with many possibly still trying to decide whether the corresponding price bounce was temporary or if it has a bit more longevity. There have been a host of plausible explanations given for the fall though, with FUD running rampant.

Sunday also saw the single largest one-day drop in mining hash rate since Nov 2017, with the hash rate on the network essentially halving.

There was speculation that the US Treasury may crack down on money laundering carried out through digital assets, while CNBC last night tweeted as new a month-old report on India preparing to possibly ban cryptocurrencies in India.

Whatever the reasons, it seems none of these have proved particularly sticky as we head into the new week. What was a bad weekend across the board has turned sharply, and the majority of cryptocurrencies are still up over the past seven days.

Ripple‚Äôs XRP ended its incredible recent run, falling from $1.74 on Saturday to $1.17 yesterday, but has since recovered to $1.44 at time of writing. Can it continue to recoup its losses?

Bitcoin Cash is also making up ground again, having drifted down the rankings of late. It‚Äôs now back in the top 10 and trading at an all-time high of almost $1,000.

Dogecoin is now changing hands at just below $0.40, up almost 400 per cent on the week. It‚Äôs now the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap. What a time to be alive!

Interesting‚Ä¶

How I explained Bitcoin to my kids. A currency needs two things: to be easily transportable, and to be rare. Bitcoin is easily transportable because you can send it from computer to computer, and rare because to make more you have to solve increasingly hard math problems. ‚Äî Paul Graham (@paulg) April 19, 2021
