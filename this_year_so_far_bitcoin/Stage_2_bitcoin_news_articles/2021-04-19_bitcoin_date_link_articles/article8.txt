Bitcoin boosters scoff that the long-term value is quite clear. After all, the skeptics have been at it for a while, and just look at how much bitcoin is worth! But as the stock prospectuses always note, past performance is no guarantee of future results. After decades of remarkable growth, Tokyo real estate was so valuable that at one point in the 1980s, the Imperial Palace was theoretically worth more than all the real estate in California. Eventually, however, prices require some sort of pragmatic anchor, or else they collapse; after Tokyo real estate prices finally crashed, it took decades for prices to even approach their previous peak.
