After weeks of teasing his drawings on Twitter, entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk announced Wednesday he's launching his first NFT collection, "VeeFriends," a series of 10,255 character tokens available for purchase via the cryptocurrency ethereum. Nonfungible tokens are a type of digital asset created to track ownership of a virtual item using blockchain technology. Such unique items could be artwork or sports trading cards — a market that Gary Vee became familiar with as a teenager, peddling baseball cards for thousands of dollars every week. The early investor in Facebook, Uber and Coinbase says each token will include a "smart contract" that includes metadata he can use to interact with buyers. One way Vaynerchuk plans to do so is through an annual business event, "VeeCon," to which token holders will be given exclusive access for three years after purchase. The tokens can be bid on via a Dutch auction, which allows any investor — institutional or individual — to place a bid at a certain price without knowing what others are offering to pay.
