How Checkout with Crypto works

On March 30, 2021, PayPal introduced Checkout with Crypto. This new feature makes it quick and easy to pay for your online purchases with cryptocurrency. PayPal users will be able to use digital currency to make purchases at all 29 million merchants that accept PayPal.

When you use Checkout with Crypto, your cryptocurrency will be converted to fiat currency (national currency, such as the U.S. dollar) during the checkout process. You will then be shown the cryptocurrency conversion spread. There are no additional transaction fees charged for this service.

Here's how to use this new feature:

Choose a store or online shop that accepts PayPal Checkout and add items to your cart as you normally would.

If you have enough of a single type of cryptocurrency in your PayPal wallet, crypto will display as a payment option.

If you have multiple types of crypto available, you can select from the following options: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, or Litecoin.

You can't mix cryptocurrencies when making a purchase. Instead, you can only select one type. In addition, you can't partially fund a payment with crypto and then use another payment method.

After you choose which type of cryptocurrency you want to use, it will be converted to fiat currency, and the transaction will then be completed.

PayPal is already known for protecting its users, and this now includes payments using digital currency. Eligible purchases made with cryptocurrency will include PayPal's 24/7 fraud protection and return shipping and purchase protection.

Buy, sell, and hold crypto with PayPal

The Checkout with Crypto feature expands on PayPal's cryptocurrency services. Introduced in October 2020, PayPal users within the U.S. (excluding Hawaii) and U.S. territories can also buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies with PayPal.

To buy crypto with Paypal, you must use your PayPal Cash or Cash Plus balance or a linked debit card or bank account. You won't be able to use a credit card. This is similar to other cryptocurrency exchanges and apps.

You can hold the crypto you buy in your PayPal account, but you can't transfer your purchased crypto off the PayPal platform. Currently, the following cryptocurrencies are available:

Bitcoin

Ethereum

Bitcoin Cash

Litecoin

If you're new to buying and selling crypto, you can start with small purchases. You're able to safely buy Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with as little as $1. Since the crypto market runs 24/7, you can buy or sell at any time of day.

Once you make a purchase, you can't reverse the charge or cancel your order. However, if unauthorized activity occurs within your account and results in the purchase of crypto, you won't be held liable.

There are zero fees for holding crypto in your PayPal account. But there are fees associated with buying and selling digital currencies within PayPal. Here's a closer look at what you will pay.
