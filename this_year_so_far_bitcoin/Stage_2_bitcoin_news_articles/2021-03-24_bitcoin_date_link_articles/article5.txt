Blockchain co-founder and CEO Peter Smith speaks during the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Portugal on November 6, 2018.

LONDON â€” Blockchain.com, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency wallet providers, announced Wednesday that it's raised $300 million in a mega fundraising round that values the company at $5.2 billion.

The London-based start-up said its latest cash injection was led by DST Global, Lightspeed Venture Partners and VY Capital. It comes just one month after the company raised $120 million at a $3 billion valuation.

Blockchain.com claims to be responsible for about 28% of all bitcoin transactions since 2012. It's mostly known for its digital wallets which are used to store cryptocurrencies but has more recently jumped into trading with its own virtual currency exchange.

The company derives its name from the eponymous blockchain network that records all bitcoin transactions.
