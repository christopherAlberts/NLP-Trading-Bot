Market strategists and financial advisors report rising interest from their investing clients about bitcoin â€” and many strategists see more upside for the cryptocurrency.

CNBC offered the strategists anonymity in exchange for their views. They shared their unofficial price targets for bitcoin over the next 12 months, which we have aggregated here.
