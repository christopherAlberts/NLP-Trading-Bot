Key Points:

Not much to change here from our prior analysis. Bitcoin continues to face rejections higher and continues to print new bearish continuation patterns.

The real threat to the downside here is below the 55k value area and then the 50k area is next to watch for.

Ultimately, I am waiting for a return to the 38k value area to buy the dip.
