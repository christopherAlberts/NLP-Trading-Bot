Early Friday, Bitcoin was just above the $40,000 level, trading up 1%, according to Coindesk.

Rival Ether was up more than 2% at $2,742.

Dogecoin was gaining more than 8% at $0.39. Dogecoin got a boost after Elon Musk issued his latest tweet on the meme token Thursday morning.

"How much is that Doge in the window?" Musk asked on Twitter on Thursday, adding a photo featuring a Shina Ibu, the Doge meme's symbol, on a $1 bill sticker attached to a laptop. The photo also features the word "Cyberviking" in neon lights. Dogecoin has come down a bit since climbing as high as 42 cents in the last 24 hours.
