The provider also offers its Bitcoin ETF (HBIT) and its Inverse Bitcoin ETF, which is design to enable investors to take advantage of volatility (by going long or short) that Hawkins expects will stay with us for quite some time until its more broadly accepted as a store of value. Many comparisons are made with gold but the CEO said there is a physical demand for bullion and real world application in its every day use, something that just doesn’t exist for cryptocurrency.

“Until there is real world applications, widespread acceptance and use of Visa or MasterCard or something like that, this volatility is here to stay for quite a while,” he said.

Trading Bitcoin through an ETF is preferable to futures or with the currencies directly. Getting in and out is “astronomically” expensive through trading platforms. Unlike an exchange, there is no insecurities with respect to hacking, market turmoil or regulators attacking those exchanges.

“From a trading vehicle perspective, why would you want to be thinking about any of these other risks when you're all you're doing is trying to get into and out of an asset class the most effectively. The best way to do that is through an ETF, especially an ETF that provides exposure directly to liquid assets, not illiquid assets.”

The current news coverage is unlikely to persuade institutions to open their arms the crypto. Custody remains a huge issue and the regulatory risk remains high, Hawkins believes will prevent the pension funds, for example, investing.
