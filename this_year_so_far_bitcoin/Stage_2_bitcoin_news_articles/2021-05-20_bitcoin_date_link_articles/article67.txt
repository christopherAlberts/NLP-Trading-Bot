What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a virtual currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown computer whizz using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto.

Unlike physical currencies such as dollars, pounds or euros, which come in physical notes and coins, Bitcoin isn't printed or minted.

Instead, Bitcoin tokens are a digital-only form of payment and are created by a computer code.

Bitcoin is powered by blockchain technology, which is at the heart of most cryptocurrencies.

Blockchain can seem very complicated, but it's a kind of database used to record transactions.

How much is Bitcoin worth?

The price of Bitcoin is currently sitting at $39,383, down by 2% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

The cryptocurrency was worth a higher $40,635 yesterday, but was still way down from its all-time high of $64,621 on April 14 .

Bitcoin has crashed in value after China this week announced a further crackdown on cryptocurrencies.

The country has banned financial institutions from offering crypto related transactions, and warned investors against speculative trading in them.

It comes after the cryptocurrency plunged last week as Elon Musk said Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin payments to buy cars.

The founder cited the harmful effects to the environment that comes with mining the cryptocurrency, which is a hugely energy-intensive process.

What are the risks of investing in Bitcoin?

Investing is always a risk but investing in cryptocurrency is an even higher risk as they are VERY volatile, so you should be prepared to lose cash.

There is also no guarantee that you can convert cryptoassests back into cash, as it may depend on the demand and supply in the existing market.

Plus, fees and charges may be higher than with regulated investment products.

Cryptocurrency firms aren't regulated in the way that other financial firms are. This means that you won't have any protection if things go wrong.

Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said: "The price of Bitcoin has tumbled by a third over the last month, which highlights the extreme risk inherent in cryptocurrency.

"Some rough and tumble is to be expected when holding something as volatile as cryptocurrency, but in recent weeks there have been significant developments which undermine Bitcoinâ€™s long term prospects.

â€œThe tide has turned on Bitcoin because environmental concerns and regulatory risks have materialised, which have raised doubt over the long term adoption of cryptocurrency by businesses and consumers."
