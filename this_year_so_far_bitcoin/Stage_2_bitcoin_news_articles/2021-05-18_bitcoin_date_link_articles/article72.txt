More employers are climbing on the bitcoin bandwagon as it goes mainstream, offering their workers an option to take home some of their pay in the cryptocurrency.

Although their numbers remain relatively small, more are expected to quickly follow, particularly fintech companies who often have many young, tech-savvy employees that are eager to take part in the crypto gold rush.
