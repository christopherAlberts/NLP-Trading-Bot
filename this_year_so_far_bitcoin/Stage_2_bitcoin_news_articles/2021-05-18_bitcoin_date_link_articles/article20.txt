A technology investor and cryptocurrency influencer is launching a bitcoin-themed pizza pop-up that will help support the development of the digital currency.

But don't try and buy your pizza with bitcoin, at least right now.

Anthony Pompliano on Tuesday unveiled Bitcoin Pizza, which will partner with independent pizzerias in 10 cities to produce and deliver its pies from May 22-29. Profits will be donated to the Human Rights Foundation's Bitcoin Development Fund, which helps fund improvements to the bitcoin network.

The brand will launch this Saturday, on the 11-year anniversary of the first commercial transaction using the digital currency: 10,000 bitcoin for two Papa John's pizzas. It is celebrated in the crypto community as Bitcoin Pizza Day.

Bitcoin Pizza was created in partnership with Popchew, a startup that helps creators launch food brands. It will relaunch as a permanent brand "in a few months" and hopes to continue working with the Human Rights Foundation at that point, said Popchew co-founder Nick Sopchak in an email.

Bitcoin Pizza's menu features five pizzas along with sides and drinks. Customers can order a pie, packaged in a Bitcoin Pizza-branded box, for delivery or pickup.

Menu prices will be higher than a normal pizza at each partner location, Pompliano said on Twitter. The excess will go to the Human Rights Foundation and the rest to the restaurant.

Prices vary by market. A 14-inch cheese pizza was $13.95 in Miami, $25.95 in Chicago and $24.95 in San Francisco.

Notably, Bitcoin Pizza does not accept bitcoin: The checkout page on its website asks for a customer's Google Pay or credit card information. Popchew said the brand was looking into adding the option.

Bitcoin's value has skyrocketed over the past year, although it has dipped in recent days. Some restaurants, including Tilman Fertitta's Landry's concepts, have begun accepting the cryptocurrency as payment.
