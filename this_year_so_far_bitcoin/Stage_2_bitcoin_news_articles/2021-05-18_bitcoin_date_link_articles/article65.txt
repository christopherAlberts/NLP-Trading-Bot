On May 11, Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin as payment for the companyâ€™s vehicles due to the strain that mining the popular cryptocurrency puts on the environment.

Musk went on to say that the company will not be selling any of the $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin it bought in February 2021, but that the company intends to use it for transactions when mining transitions to using more sustainable energy sources.
