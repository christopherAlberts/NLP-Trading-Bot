A parliamentary inquiry will investigate how to regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, as part of a push to strengthen the local fintech sector and encourage financial innovation.

While some money managers say bitcoin is becoming a more mainstream financial asset, the country’s biggest banks remain deeply hesitant towards the fast-growing sector, in part because the lack of regulation makes it high risk.

How crypto assets could be regulated, as is starting to occur in some countries overseas, will be explored by the Senate’s select committee on Australia as a technology and financial centre, chaired by NSW Liberal Senator Andrew Bragg.

An issues paper on Wednesday said the committee would look at the policy and legal backdrop facing cryptocurrencies in Australia compared with the approaches being taken in Canada, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the European Union.
