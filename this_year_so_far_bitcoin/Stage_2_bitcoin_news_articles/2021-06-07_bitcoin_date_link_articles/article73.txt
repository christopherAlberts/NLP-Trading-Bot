The Dogecoin price was stuck in a narrow range over the weekend and into Monday, oscillating between USD 0.36 and USD 0.37 for most of the time. Crypto investors laid it on thick for Elon Musk in hopes that a social media campaign will spark a buying spree, but it appears to have taken bitcoin to flip the markets green.

The hashtag ‘We Love You Elon’ is trending on Twitter, with more than 67,000 tweets since Sunday night. The movement, which was started by Dogecoin bull and YouTuber Matt Wallace, was designed to show gratitude to the Tesla chief for being the ‘Doge Father,’ as the crypto community refers to him. And while it didn’t translate to gains in the market, bitcoin bull Michael Saylor had it covered.
