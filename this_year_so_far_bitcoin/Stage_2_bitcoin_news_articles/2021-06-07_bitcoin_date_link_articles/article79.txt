ETHEREUMMAX has risen sharply thanks in part to the endorsement of boxing legend Floyd Mayweather during his anticipated fight last night.

An exhibition match between Mayweather and YouTube star Logan Paul, lasted for eight rounds and ended without an official winner being read.

The newly launched token has risen by a staggering 1900% since May 28 - growing to over 50,000 token holders and over 10,000 telegram members in just over two weeks.

And over the last 24 hours, EMAX traded 1.5% and 4.2% lower against Bitcoin and Ethereum.
