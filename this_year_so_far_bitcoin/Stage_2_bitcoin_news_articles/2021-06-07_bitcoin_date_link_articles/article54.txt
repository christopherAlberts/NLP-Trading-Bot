‘Going to the moon’ is the cryptocurrency jackpot. It’s when the price of a cryptocurrency skyrockets off the charts. Billionaire Elon Musk’s cryptic tweets and indirect messages have been the driving factor behind many a moon run in recent days -- most recently, CumRocket.But, that’s not the only inspiration he has to offer. While Musk is sending the value of meme and joke-based cryptocurrencies to the moon, one crypto exchange thinks it’s actually a viable idea. Crypto exchange BitMEX has partnered with a space robotics company called Astrobotic to literally put Bitcoin on the moon through an upcoming lunar mission.While the billionaire has previously sent his Tesla Roadster to space as a marketing stunt, BitMEX is trying to achieve a similar feat with Bitcoin. Bitcoin literally going to the moon means a lot for the community, as the technology is considered to be a massive milestone in human history. The moon landings, the internet age, and now, decentralized finance.A physical coin, similar in design to a Casascius coin, will be included in the payload of an Astrobotic Peregrine lander that will touch down on the moon later this year. Casascius coins are physical metal coins created by Bitcoin user Casascius . His real name is Mike Caldwell and they were sold until the end of 2013. The coin contains an embedded piece of paper with digital Bitcoin value, covered by a tamper-resistant hologram.These physical coins are available in 1, 10, 25, 100, and 1000 BTC denominations. They can no longer be purchased and once its private key is used, the coin has no value left. And it cannot be tampered with as any attempt will destroy the critical hologram.“It will be the first-ever bitcoin to be on the surface of the Moon, with photographic evidence taken to prove it,” BitMEX noted. Precisely, the coin will display the BitMEX name, the mission name, and the minting date. Also, the bitcoin price at the time of minting.If humans are able to settle on the moon in the coming future, it’ll be interesting to see whether Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency revolution could truly take over the world, or will it be like the dot com bust.After an insane bull run that surged the value of Bitcoin , Ethereum, Dogecoin, and even Shiba Inu, the SpaceX and Tesla CEO were seen eyeing yet another cryptocurrency over the weekend-- CumRocket.Its price increased by over 352% from its 24-hour low of $0.05482 to its all-time high of $0.2481, according to CoinMarketCap data.The latest cryptocurrency in town aims to build a not-safe-for-work (NFSW) platform where users can upload content, similar to OnlyFans . Denoted by $cummies, it’s a deflationary token that has an in-built staking system. So, users gain interest without actually staking. It surged more than 30% after Elon’s tweet, within two hours. Though, it corrected quickly when the community started calling out his reckless behaviour.Simply put, Cumrocket is a cryptocurrency that provides a marketplace for adult content or, as it is otherwise known, NSFW (not safe for work) content. Just like Ethereum, it’s a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace where creators of the content are paid in crypto and tipped using special tokens called Cummies.This content will be accessible to the user on their digital wallet and on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchain network.It’s safe to say that Musk has single-handedly, once again, sent another cryptocurrency ‘to the moon’, metaphorically with his cryptic tweets.
