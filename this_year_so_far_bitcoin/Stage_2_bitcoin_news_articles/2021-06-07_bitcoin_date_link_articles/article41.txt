Pysh started the panel off with a fiery opener, stating, “If you don’t want to participate in Bitcoin, you’re canceling yourself.”

The group appeared to agree that the environment surrounding fiat currencies is in a continued decline, and that there was no cushion to the crash that may come from fiat currencies. Jeff Booth stated, “If the system fails, it fails spectacularly.”

Greg Foss made it clear that, “Bitcoin is the best asymmetric trade opportunity I’ve seen in thirty years of trading risk.”

The panel was bullish, informative and extremely compelling in substance.
