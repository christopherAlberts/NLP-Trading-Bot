PALO ALTO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 7, 2021 /Bitcoin Latinum, the next-generation insured Bitcoin fork capable of massive transaction volume, digital asset management, cyber security, and capacity is announcing a groundbreaking green initiative to achieve a carbon net-zero footprint, as a commitment to sustainable environmental practices and support of the Crypto Climate Accord. This will be achieved through a Consensus protocol system for settling transactions. Bitcoin Latinum is also announcing its hard-fork and public trading availability for Q3 2021.

Bitcoin Latinum is an enhanced Bitcoin fork. The Bitcoin Latinum algorithm and infrastructure break barriers and speed limits that have prevented some virtual currencies from achieving practical, real-time use. Bitcoin Latinum - to trade under LTNM - will be mining-free, with a fixed supply of 888,888,888 pre-mined tokens. Legacy tokens, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, rely on a proof-of-work system to confirm transactions generated through mining, which has proven to be detrimental to the environment given the massive electricity demands have increased the consumption of fossil fuels such as coal.

Announced to the world in November 2020, Bitcoin Latinum is aiming to hard-fork and become publicly available for trading in Q3 2021 on major exchanges across the globe, including the Americas, Europe, and Asia.

Bitcoin Latinum sold out its initial pre-sale with over nine figures committed from buyers across the globe in November 2020. In Q1 2021, Bitcoin Latinum launched an international giveaway of a new Tesla Roadster, to massive interest and submissions. The winner of the giveaway will be announced after the public listing of LTNM.

The Bitcoin Latinum tokens are a part of a blockchain ecosystem being adopted by numerous companies in media, gaming, storage, cloud, and telecommunications. Bitcoin Latinum tokens will be interchangeably used on each of these partner/supplier networks by consumers. In addition, Bitcoin Latinum adds security around inflight transactions and enhanced consensus node protection based on memory scanning technology.
