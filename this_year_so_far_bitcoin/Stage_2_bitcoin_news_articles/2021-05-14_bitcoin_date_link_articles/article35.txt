Crypto at a glance

The shockwaves continue to reverberate on social media from Elon Musk‚Äôs announcement late Wednesday night that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin due to energy concerns, but with the price holding strong at $50,000 the big question now is: does anyone else really care?

Has the cryptocurrency industry outgrown the random warblings of an unpredictable and easily-bored billionaire?

The immediate aftermath of Musk‚Äôs meltdown saw Bitcoin‚Äôs sharpest drop for four months, falling more than 13 per cent in a day. However, things seem to have settled quickly and it appears support at $50,000 is holding strong. The leading cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading at $50,039.48, down 1.74 per cent over the last 24 hours.

While Musk‚Äôs various statements have given Bitcoin a couple of timely boosts on its way up, experts seem unshaken by the revelations and it seems the same may not be true in the other direction. Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist Mike McGlone, for one, wrote on Thursday that: ‚ÄúElon Musk saying Tesla is suspending purchases using Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt shake our thesis that the crypto is in early price discovery days on its way to becoming the global digital reserve asset in a world of accelerating digitalization and electrification.‚Äù

There‚Äôs limited movement generally today, with Ethereum also down again below $4,000 to just below $3,9000, though it‚Äôs still up more than 11 per cent on the week. Several cryptocurrencies actually seem to have benefited from Musk‚Äôs announcement, particularly those boasting stronger green credentials. Cardano (ADA) surged yesterday to a high of $1.96, catapulting its market capitalisation to roughly $61.5 billion and making it again the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Can it break $2?

Other big winners are Dogecoin, which was again the recipient of Musk‚Äôs good will as he claimed he was working with developers to improve the technology, despite cynics noting a lack of apparent developers. Will he succeed in making Doge more than just a joke?

I refuse to believe one of the smartest people on Earth ‚Äì @elonmusk ‚Äì JUST realized Bitcoin uses electricity. @APompliano we need to get to the bottom of this lol ‚Äî Andrei Jikh (@andreijikh) May 13, 2021

I wouldn‚Äôt buy a Tesla with Bitcoin anyway. ‚Äî Okung üíØ (@RussellOkung) May 12, 2021

Ok‚Ä¶

Working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising. ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 13, 2021

Oh‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶electricity isn‚Äôt used for transaction processing. It‚Äôs used to secure the network. Doge is PoW meaning it faces the same basic dynamics as Bitcoin. It uses less electricity now because it‚Äôs less secure. ‚Äî Ari Paul ‚õìÔ∏è (@AriDavidPaul) May 13, 2021
