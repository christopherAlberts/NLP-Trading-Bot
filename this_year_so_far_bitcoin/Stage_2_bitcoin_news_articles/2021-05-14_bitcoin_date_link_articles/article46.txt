A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fell to an early morning intraday low $48,877.0 before making a move.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $47,123, Bitcoin rallied to a mid-afternoon intraday high $51,512.0.

While falling short of the first major resistance level at $51,855, Bitcoin broke back through the 23.6% FIB of $50,473.

A second sell-off, however, saw Bitcoin slide back through the 23.6% FIB to sub-$50,000 levels.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact in spite of the latest slide back to sub-$50,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $27,237 to form a near-term bearish trend.
