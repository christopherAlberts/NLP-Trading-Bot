From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. What started out as a kind of inside joke in the world of cryptocurrency has quickly become, for some, a very serious path to wealth. Today: Kevin Roose on the latest frenzy around a digital currency and what it tells us about the flaws in the old economy and the risks and rewards of the new one.

[music]

It’s Friday, May 14. So Kevin, the last time we spoke with you, you had, quite improbably, made $750,000 by selling a picture of your column in the form of a non-fungible token. So what have you been up to since then?

kevin roose

Well, quick update. The value of cryptocurrency has skyrocketed in the time since that episode, so the NFT that I sold is actually now worth about $1.4 million.

michael barbaro

Show off.

kevin roose

Again, I don’t get to keep it. I am a fake cryptocurrency millionaire, but there you go. So I’ve moved on from NFTs, but I’ve stayed very interested in the world of cryptocurrency. And for the last few weeks, there’s been one giant story in the world of cryptocurrency. And that is the story of Dogecoin.

archived recording [MUSIC]: We’re going to take Dogecoin to the moon. archived recording 2 A positively dogged rise, it says here, in the price of Dogecoin.

kevin roose

Dogecoin has been everywhere.

archived recording Its total value stands at $86 billion, more than FedEx.

michael barbaro

Every time I open my TikTok feed, there’s a video about Dogecoin.

archived recording (music) Hold it, hold it, hold it, never sell. Much rich. Buy more, buy more, buy more, it’s doing well. Such high.

kevin roose

Every time I go on Twitter, there are people talking about it. I have friends that I haven’t talked to in years texting me about whether or not they should invest in it.

archived recording (music) Shut up and take my money. archived recording Every day, the internet has a main character. And today, Reddit and Twitter have decided that main character is Dogecoin. archived recording (music) Dogecoin to the moon. And beyond.

michael barbaro

So unlock that word and that concept for us, as only you can. Dogecoin.

kevin roose

Sure, so Dogecoin is something like Bitcoin or Ethereum, or any of these other cryptocurrencies. It’s a way to send and receive money on the internet. And it was created in 2013 during the first real speculative mania around Bitcoin. And it was literally meant as a joke. These two programmers created it to poke fun at how seriously all these investors and speculators were taking cryptocurrency. And basically, they decided, we should make fun of the people trading cryptocurrencies by making our own joke cryptocurrency. So they take this meme, this Shiba Inu dog, who was called Doge, that was popular in the 2013 internet — who would talk in Comic Sans and would say things like, “much wow,” “so scare.” So they decided, we’re going to combine Bitcoin with Doge and make Dogecoin.

michael barbaro

OK, and just how clear is it to everyone that this is a parody, a joke?

kevin roose

Oh, it’s completely clear to everyone. Because not only is the whole idea of Dogecoin just, on its face, absurd and ridiculous, but the technology itself — the coin itself — is actually broken in this way that makes it unusable as a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin and all these other cryptocurrencies, they have this capped supply. The code actually limits the number of coins that can be created. But at the beginning, Dogecoin doesn’t have that cap. There just wasn’t a limit on the number of coins that could be produced. And recently, they’ve gone back and fixed that. They’ve added a cap. But it shows you how absurd this whole project was.

michael barbaro

OK, so given that context, who would bother to trade this parody of a currency, Dogecoin?

kevin roose

So for most of its life, Dogecoin is basically worthless. One Dogecoin is worth a tiny fraction of cent. And it periodically gets popular, people talk about it for a minute, the price goes up a little bit and then it comes back down. And it basically just fades into the background, as all of these other cryptocurrencies are becoming real and legitimate and are seeing their values go up. So this year, as Bitcoin and Ethereum and these other cryptocurrencies are having another massive run, Dogecoin made this very strange comeback. It totally exploded. And so, I’m watching all this happen, I’m hanging out on the Dogecoin subreddit — for work, I promise. And I kept hearing about these big time Dogecoin traders. There was one in particular, people on the Dogecoin subreddit that were calling him like The Dogefather, or Slumdoge millionaire.

kevin roose Would you mind just introducing yourself and explaining a little bit about who you are? glauber contessoto Yeah, sure.

kevin roose

And his name is Glauber Contessoto.

glauber contessoto So I go by Jason or Pro, but my birth name is Glauber Contessoto.

kevin roose

We get on a video call. He’s a big guy, big beard. He’s got a picture of Jay Z behind him.

glauber contessoto And I work here in L.A., I work at a music company, a hip hop music company.

kevin roose

So Glauber is 33 years old. He was born in Brazil. He came to the U.S. when he was six years old, and his family landed in the Washington, D.C. area.

glauber contessoto We basically grew up very poor. So I remember growing up, we were in a little apartment, basement kind of area. I shared a room with my sister until I was 13.

kevin roose

His mom and dad didn’t even have their own room.

glauber contessoto They had, like, a back end of the apartment that we had to put a divider up so they had some privacy. I remember always wondering why we were on a budget, or why we were so poor. There were certain instances where I would go to my room and go through the toy box and the closet and find old toys and stuff and pile them in my backpack. And I’d take them to school, and then on the way to school on the school bus, I would sell them to kids. And they’d give me their lunch money. Like $2, $5 here and there. And I used to come home with $30, and my mom was like, how the hell did you get $30? And I was like, I was just selling some old toys I had.

kevin roose

So he graduates from high school, goes to college, but ends up dropping out. And then stays in the D.C. area for a while. And he meets this aspiring rapper and decides to manage him. And he really wants to work in the music industry.

glauber contessoto So I’m like, all right. What do we have to do? We need to get the hell out of here, OK? We need to get out of Maryland. Maryland is not the place for music. So I’m like, either I’m moving to New York or L.A. I had some friends out here already, so I was like, L.A. it is.

kevin roose

And like a lot of people who moved to L.A. hoping to have a career in the entertainment industry, Glauber has a dream. He wants to buy a house.

glauber contessoto That’s what I’ve always wanted to do. My family has never owned a house. So I was like, I want to buy a house. And the reason for me buying a house is I wanted to get a bunch of rooms so my artists could come live with me. Like I’d get Lambo to come out here and live there and work on music. He doesn’t have to worry about rent, doesn’t have to worry about food or anything.

kevin roose

But when he gets to L.A., he does not have anywhere near the amount of money he’s going to need to do that.

glauber contessoto So I’m sleeping on couches. I have a friend of mine in Van Nuys, I’m sleeping on his couch. And then I sleep on a couch in West Hills. So I actually have screenshots of all of 2017 of my bank account. Because to motivate myself, I changed the name of my bank account to “Pro is Broke as [EXPLETIVE].” And then I had the little part there, and it’d be like $1 or $0.50, or $50, or something like that in my account. It was crazy. So — kevin roose I didn’t change the name of your bank account. glauber contessoto Yeah, you can. It’s so funny.

kevin roose

And he starts picking up some freelance video editing gigs, he’s making like $1,000 a month. And he eventually gets this break. He gets a job at a startup in L.A. They’re having him do entry-level video editing.

glauber contessoto They offer me 32k. And I’m blown away. I’m like, $32,000 a year? That’s crazy. I’m telling my friends about it. I’m like, I just got a job, it’s $32,000 a year. My friends are like, that’s not a lot, you should ask for more. So I ask for 40k, they’re like, 35k. And I’m like, all right, 36k, please. And they’re like, all right. So they give me 36k. First year, I get 36k.

kevin roose

And as he starts getting more experienced and taking on more responsibilities, he eventually starts making a little more money.

kevin roose $45,000. glauber contessoto I’m running the entire department, I’m overseeing all these things. I’m getting the YouTube channel so many more views and more revenue. So I go from 45k to 60k. All I do is work, right? kevin roose So you’re making a little bit more money at that point. Did you change the name of your bank account? glauber contessoto Yes, I did. I just went back to what it was before.

kevin roose

So at that point, he’s not sleeping on couches anymore. He’s renting a place with his brother. But as he’s continuing to save up, he really develops tunnel vision on this goal of buying a house.

glauber contessoto I do everything in my power to do that. I’m saving every bit of money that I can. My money every month is literally going to bills, my car is a piece of shit. I’m not going out shopping, I’m not going on vacation, I’m not going to concerts.

kevin roose

So at the beginning of 2020, he finally has enough money saved up that he thinks he can start looking for a house. But that turns out not to be easy.

glauber contessoto I can’t get a loan for the life of me. No mortgage company is loaning me, because I need to put down at least 20 percent.

kevin roose

He just can’t find any place that’s within his budget.

glauber contessoto So I’m like, all right, I have to make my house choices lower, right? So I tried about two or three different houses. Nothing happened. I’m like, this is my last shot at this, right? I’m gonna find a house that’s $300,000, because I could do 20 percent of that.

kevin roose

So he starts working with a realtor, and eventually —

glauber contessoto I find this house in the woods past Pasadena, up by the mountains, and it’s $350,000. It’s a little cottage place. I’m like, I mean, I could blast music, we can do a studio in there, that’s fine. At least I’ll have a house, right? That’s all I ever wanted.

kevin roose

So he gets really excited. He can actually afford a down payment on this place.

glauber contessoto So the realtor calls the house, calls me back the next day and says, oh, they’re cash only. You got to pay for the whole thing.

kevin roose

And so his dream is dashed again.

michael barbaro

Right, because he doesn’t have $350,000, he just has enough for a down payment.

kevin roose

Right.

glauber contessoto I’m like, that’s it. I can’t get a house. God doesn’t want me to get a house.

kevin roose

And he ultimately decides, maybe this just isn’t in the cards for me right now.

michael barbaro

So this is a pretty depressingly familiar version of the American dream. A guy who comes from not very much, works really hard, tries to save up, does save up and still feels stuck. Because in a city like Los Angeles, given the economics of trying to buy a home, he is actually stuck. The system is just not working for him.

kevin roose

Exactly. This whole classic sense of, you work hard, you climb the ladder, you buy a house, you settle down. That version of the economy is just not really working for him. But then he figures out that he actually has another option.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

kevin roose

So 2020, the pandemic hits, go into lockdown. And over the course of that year, Glauber stops thinking about buying a house and starts just focusing on work. But then this year —

glauber contessoto 2021, GameStop happens, right?

kevin roose

This weird thing happens with GameStop, this video game store.

michael barbaro

Right. This weird thing being a social media frenzy around GameStop that leads the stock to soar, creates enormous wealth for the people who got in early. But more than that, it also sent a message to establishment players and finance that regular investors were now in charge.

kevin roose

Right.

glauber contessoto I first learned about GameStop on — about the Reddit group, right? WallStreetBets. I’m like, oh, let me go look this up. I didn’t know anything about Reddit, I had heard about it, never checked it out.

kevin roose

So basically, a bunch of people on this Reddit forum called WallStreetBets were teaming up to pump up the stock price of GameStop, basically to try to screw these hedge funds that had bet against GameStop.

glauber contessoto WallStreetBets, I’m all over there. And I’m like oh, GameStop looks like a good idea! We’re going to stick it to the man, let’s go. Little guys versus the big guys, the big hedge funds. Let’s bleed them dry.

kevin roose

And this all went up spectacularly, and then came crashing down spectacularly. And there was this whole drama with Robinhood, this smartphone app that people are using to buy and sell GameStop stock, which temporarily shuts down. It becomes this, basically, this huge nationwide financial frenzy.

glauber contessoto So what do I do? I buy a bunch of GameStop when it’s $300.

kevin roose

And Glauber actually participates.

glauber contessoto The very next day, Robinhood shuts it down. You can’t buy anything. And it goes down. And I’m seeing myself losing money, losing money.

kevin roose

And proceeds to lose most of his money the next day when it crashes. But despite the fact that he lost money trading GameStop, he also saw that some people who got in and out at the right time had actually made millions of dollars trading GameStop. And that gets Glauber thinking, if I could figure out the next GameStop before it happens, maybe that’s my ticket.

glauber contessoto While I go through the Reddit, somebody posts, has Dogecoin ever gone to $1? And then I’m like, what the hell is Dogecoin?

kevin roose

And that’s when he hears about Dogecoin.

glauber contessoto So I start researching Dogecoin. And I’m like, oh, you can buy this on Robinhood? This is cool.

kevin roose

This thing that is really taking off on the internet, that is exciting people, that’s getting people interested in investing, and that the people who get in on the ground floor of this might actually be able to make some money off of it.

glauber contessoto So I’m on Robinhood and Dogecoin — I search it, and I’m like, oh shit, I could just buy it here. I have an extra $40 somehow, my buying power or whatever, right? So I take those $40, I put it in Dogecoin. I’m like, this is fun, let’s see what happens. Put it on Dogecoin.

kevin roose

So he starts small.

glauber contessoto And the very next day, Dogecoin goes from a penny to $0.08. I’m staring at my phone watching it go from $40 to $100 to $150 to $200, $250, $300, $350.

kevin roose

The price of Dogecoin goes up like 700 percent.

michael barbaro

Wow.

glauber contessoto I’m like, I don’t know what the hell this is but I’m not missing the next time this happens. I have to get in on this. No stock I’ve ever purchased before has ever done this.

kevin roose

And he’s realizing, oh, this might be actually happening. I might have bet right.

glauber contessoto So that’s when I’m like, what’s Dogecoin? I go through the entire history. I learn everything I could possibly learn about it. I research it for hours on end. I even have screenshots of my phone and how my screen time was. 20 hours a day on the phone, researching this stuff.

kevin roose

He gets very, very excited about it. Starts spending a lot more time in the Dogecoin subreddit, and he becomes even more optimistic about what Dogecoin is going to do.

michael barbaro

So what’s drawing him to doge is not the intrinsic value of a Dogecoin, but the fact that lots of other people are excited about and being drawn into Doge.

kevin roose

Right. In a way, it’s purely speculative. He’s just betting that this thing that is going up will continue to go up. But he also starts developing this bigger idea about Dogecoin and cryptocurrency and what kind of has value in today’s economy.

michael barbaro

And why, in his mind, does Dogecoin have value in this economy? What does he tell you?

kevin roose

He basically sees that the world of the attention economy of memes and funny videos and shares and retweets, it’s merging with the stock market. And so you have these companies like GameStop or Tesla or something, that people on the internet just decide is a meme. Like a meme stock. And so their goal is just to have fun with it, to push it as high as they can get it, and then hopefully get out before it all comes crashing down. And he sees the cycle happening. And so he sees that if something is capturing people’s attention, it’s probably a good idea to invest in it early.

michael barbaro

Right. I mean, Warren Buffett would scoff at this. The fundamentals of this don’t make any sense. There aren’t sales, there aren’t profits. But the wisdom of crowds says that this is worth more and more and more, and Glauber subscribes to that belief.

kevin roose

Right. And I think it goes without saying, this is not what a typical financial adviser would recommend doing. But Glauber has this new millennial, Gen Z way of looking at the stock market, which is that it doesn’t really matter what the underlying value of something is. It’s more about attention and momentum and figuring out where the culture is going than it is about the actual soundness of the investment.

glauber contessoto Wake up — go to sleep for a few hours, wake up. Next day, bam. Up at $0.05, $0.06, goes back down to $0.04. I’m like, this isn’t going down to $0.02 ever again, this isn’t going down to $0.01 ever again. This is going to go up.

kevin roose

And then there’s this tipping point.

michael barbaro

And when is that?

kevin roose

In February of this year, Elon Musk, C.E.O. of Tesla, one of the richest men in the world, and self-appointed king of the meme internet, starts tweeting about Dogecoin. He calls it the people’s crypto. And he says that he’s actually buying Dogecoin for his son.

glauber contessoto Elon does a blast of eight or nine or ten tweets, back to back to back to back. And it shoots up from $0.03 to $0.04 to $0.05, to $0.06, I’m like, this is it. This is the blast off. I’m missing it right now.

kevin roose

And Glauber starts thinking about this as the point of no return. Like Dogecoin is popular, it’s getting more popular, Elon Musk is tweeting about it. This thing is going to the moon, as they say on Reddit.

glauber contessoto So now I was like, I’m going all in. This last thing was it for me.

kevin roose

And so he makes up his mind, and he decides to put everything he has into Dogecoin.

michael barbaro

Can you quantify that? What do you mean?

kevin roose

I mean everything. Like, his entire life savings.

kevin roose How much money did you decide to invest? glauber contessoto Total, it was $250,000 at 4.5 cents.

kevin roose

He put in about $250,000.

michael barbaro

Wow. That’s a lot of money.

kevin roose

A lot of money. And actually —

glauber contessoto I say total because I took money out in margin. kevin roose Meaning you borrowed money — glauber contessoto I borrowed money from Robinhood, correct.

kevin roose

He went into debt so that he could buy more Dogecoin.

michael barbaro

So how does this quarter million dollar bet end up playing out for Glauber?

kevin roose

So he goes all in in February. And for the first couple of months, it doesn’t really make him much money. The price of Dogecoin is just flat, it’s like $0.05 or $0.06. And he’s watching it go up a little bit, down a little bit. It’s not moving much. But then April 15 rolls around.

michael barbaro

What happens then?

kevin roose

So that day, it’s a Thursday. Elon Musk — he’s been tweeting about Dogecoin off and on for a long time — posts this image on Twitter. It’s actually a painting of a dog barking at the moon. And he captions it, “Doge barking at the moon.” And people on Reddit get super excited, because the moon, in Reddit speak, is what happens when something goes viral. Right on cue, the price of Dogecoin starts to skyrocket.

michael barbaro

And what does this mean for Glauber?

glauber contessoto Man, it was the craziest day. Because, like I said, I knew in my heart it was going to go up.

kevin roose

So he’s just watching all this happen in real time. He’s looking at his phone, at the value of his investment.

glauber contessoto When this starts climbing, and I start seeing more money in my account than I’ve ever seen in my entire life —

kevin roose

It’s just going up and up and up.

glauber contessoto $200, $300, $400, $500, $600, $700.

kevin roose

It’s adding just hundreds of thousands of dollars in minutes.

glauber contessoto I’m waiting for a dip at any point, a crash. I’m like, it’s going to go back to $300,000 or whatever, any time. But it keeps going.

kevin roose

And eventually, the price of Dogecoin ends up going up hundreds of percentage points that day, like more than triple the value at the start of the day.

glauber contessoto So I know the exact time it happened. It was April 15 at 6 p.m. I’m staring at my phone like I usually do, and I’m looking at it, and it’s going up, going up, going up.

kevin roose

And the value of Glauber’s Dogecoin investment —

glauber contessoto And then it crosses over the million mark.

kevin roose

Crosses $1 million.

glauber contessoto And I’m like, it’s today. Today, now. Right now, I’m a millionaire. I’m 33 years old, I just became a millionaire.

michael barbaro

Wow.

kevin roose

Yeah, it’s wild.

glauber contessoto I texted my mom. I was like, mom, your son’s a millionaire. She was like, you’re lying, no, you’re not, blah, blah, blah. I sent her a screenshot — I have a screenshot of all that. I sent it to her and I was like, your son’s finally a millionaire. I was like, everything’s going to be all right. I was like, you can start looking at houses. And she writes me back, she’s like, all I want is you and your sister’s happiness and I’m good. That shit, it was crazy, man. This thing changed my life.

kevin roose

And it doesn’t even stop there.

glauber contessoto 12 hours later, 6:40 a.m. the next day, it hits 1.8 million.

kevin roose

The price of Dogecoin just keeps going up and up and up, and by the time I talked to him —

glauber contessoto I could show you guys on the screen right now, if you want to see.

kevin roose

What is it? Can you just read that to me?

glauber contessoto Yeah.

kevin roose

He had turned his original investment of about $250,000 into —

glauber contessoto At this very second, it’s at $2,431,000.

kevin roose

Almost $2.5 million.

michael barbaro

Wow.

kevin roose Yeah, that’s a big number. glauber contessoto That’s a huge number. Oh, it just went up.

michael barbaro

That is truly astonishing. And basically, an overnight fortune.

kevin roose

Yeah. This is awkward, I’m blushing as I’m explaining this to you, Michael. But he is very proud, because to go from his initial investment to $1 million took exactly 69 days. And 69 is the sex number. Which he thinks is funny, because 69, in Dogecoin world, is a very funny number. For reasons that I’m not going to explain to listeners of this podcast.

michael barbaro

But of course, this wealth is paper wealth. He has to sell Dogecoin in order to get it, and I’m nervous, just hearing you tell this story, on Glauber’s behalf, because I think it might be time for him to sell. So does he sell?

kevin roose

No.

glauber contessoto No. It didn’t cross my mind, not once, to sell it.

michael barbaro

And why not?

kevin roose

Because he sees this as a long-term investment.

kevin roose I guess a lot of people in your situation would say, OK, I made this bet, it paid off. Now I’m gonna just take some money off the table. I’m going to make sure I have enough money to buy a house, and I’ll keep some money in, maybe, but I’m going to just make sure I have a little bit of security in case it does crash, in case it does turn out to be a bubble. But you didn’t do that. glauber contessoto No. kevin roose Why not? glauber contessoto I know this is not the best example, but if you could buy into Amazon when it was $10 a share, would you have sold when it hit $20? Or when it hit $200? No, you wouldn’t.

kevin roose

I think part of the reason is just he thinks it’s going to keep going up. He doesn’t want to miss out on the gains that he’ll make if Dogecoin goes to $1 or $2 or $5

glauber contessoto If I could go back in time and buy Bitcoin when it was at $50 and sold it at $300, you know what I mean? You wouldn’t do that.

kevin roose

But he’s also got this ideological motivation.

glauber contessoto I look at Dogecoin as the future. I truly believe in the cryptocurrency. I believe Dogecoin is the future of currency.

kevin roose

Like a lot of people, he thinks that the old financial system, with all the banks and hedge funds and transaction fees and middlemen, that’s all becoming obsolete.

glauber contessoto My generation just woke up, almost. I feel like we woke up and we’re taking this shit on our own. We realize the system is rigged. The stock market’s rigged. Wall Street, they all play their game, hedge funds play their game. If they’re winning, it’s all good and fine and dandy. And you can buy and sell all you want, it’s a free trade. As soon as they start losing billions, they change the rules.

kevin roose

And the thing that’s replacing it is this parallel economy that’s growing up around the internet. This cryptocurrency economy.

glauber contessoto Cryptocurrency is a new space, it’s the future, there aren’t any hedge funds trying to keep us down. There isn’t any billionaires on the other side that if we win, they lose. So the same way we all pooled around GameStop, we can pool around Dogecoin and actually change the future of currency.

kevin roose

So he’s optimistic about cryptocurrency, but he’s specifically optimistic about Dogecoin.

glauber contessoto It’s the most friendly, the funnest, the most exciting cryptocurrency. Kids will get into it, old people will get into it, people that don’t know anything about cryptocurrency. Dogecoin is the bridge. Dogecoin bridges the gap between the real world and the cryptocurrency world. kevin roose If you’re wrong, and Dogecoin loses 99 percent of its value tomorrow, would you have any regrets? glauber contessoto I’ll buy the dip. kevin roose You’ll buy more? glauber contessoto Yeah. kevin roose You’re a madman.

michael barbaro

Kevin, when I think about the story that Glauber has told you, it ultimately feels like a tale of economic frustration and someone looking for a shortcut to the wealth that they’re not finding through traditional work.

kevin roose

Yeah. I think, in some way, he represents the attitudes of this cohort of young people who are getting out into the economy, who are trying to make it the old way, climbing the ladder one rung at a time. And they’re realizing, that actually might not work anymore. And so they’re looking for trampolines, basically. They’re looking for big bets that they can take. Maybe it won’t work, but maybe it will. And that’s the kind of return that’s actually going to get them the kind of stability that they’ve been dreaming about.

michael barbaro

Well since you mentioned trampoline, let’s talk, though, about the risks involved in bouncing around on a trampoline as an economic philosophy in life.

kevin roose

Yeah, I mean the only time I’ve ever broken a bone, fun fact, is on a trampoline. So I know that trampolines are risky. They’re not a safe thing to play around on. And even within the speculative mania of cryptocurrency, there are people who think that Dogecoin is the least responsible thing you could invest in. That it’s a joke, people are going to lose everything. Basically, even people who believe in cryptocurrency, some of them, are saying Dogecoin is going to end up going very badly for people. But to Glauber, that risk is not a turnoff.

glauber contessoto Scared money don’t make no money. That’s just the reality of it. People get scared and people want to be safe and not take any risks.

kevin roose

In fact, that’s what draws him to Dogecoin. He wants the risk.

glauber contessoto I feel like those experts on TV and the older generation of old money and wealth, they try to scare people into staying safe, right? Into not taking these big risks. It’s almost like they want to keep everybody in the safe zone, so nobody gets too rich. Nobody touches the 1 percent, you know what I mean? I feel like my generation, we’re not taking that shit. We’re learning for ourselves. I’m not going to take what an expert says on TV for their word.

kevin roose

He doesn’t want to do it the safe way. Because he thinks maybe this is his trampoline. Maybe this is the risk that is going to pay off for him.

michael barbaro

So Kevin, before I let you go, I know that you spoke to Glauber about a week ago, which is an eternity in the cryptocurrent market. So what’s going on with his holdings in Dogecoin?

kevin roose

Well, Dogecoin has had a rough week. On Saturday, Elon Musk, spiritual leader of the Dogecoin movement, hosted Saturday Night Live. There was a skit about Dogecoin, and immediately following the show, the price of Dogecoin started to plummet and lost about 30 percent of its value.

michael barbaro

Wow.

So Glauber, and everyone else who invested in Dogecoin, took a hit. He’s still up, he’s still a millionaire on paper and on his app. But he’s not quite as rich as he was a couple of weeks ago. In the Dogecoin Reddit, there’s a saying that the price of Dogecoin never falls, it only goes on sale. And so when I emailed Glauber and asked if he was having regrets about not having sold his Dogecoin when the price was higher, he said, nope. And in fact, he bought 30,000 more Dogecoin.
