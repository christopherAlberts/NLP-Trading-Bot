March is typically a time to celebrate women’s contributions in history, but the past year of COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on women – especially women of color. On this episode, in honor of Women’s History Month, we asked women at the Brookings Institution to share their thoughts on what top policy considerations they have for the Biden administration to help address the needs of women – both in the U.S. and around the world.

Also on this episode, Senior Fellow Marcela Escobari offers another edition of our of Sustainable Development Spotlight series, with a focus on her new policy brief on how federal infrastructure investment can put America to work. Also listen to this segment on SoundCloud.
