Bitcoin fell below $50,000 on Thursday as Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey warned that anyone investing in the digital currency should be prepared for massive losses.

The cryptocurrency slipped under $47,000 following an announcement by Elon Musk that his electric car company Tesla would no longer accept it for payment due to concerns about the amount of energy it uses.

Meanwhile, Mr Bailey issued a fresh warning to punters thinking about a bet.

Speaking at a Bank of England citizens’ panel event, he said: “You’ve probably seen all the stories about the price of bitcoin, share prices in the U.S. suddenly rocketing up for companies that nobody quite knows what they do.

“That’s a warning sign. People are looking for investment opportunities. Buy it if you want but it has no intrinsic value.”

It came as the Bank of England's deputy governor, Sir Jon Cunliffe, said the institution needs its own digital pound to provide a safe harbour when a crisis hits the banking system.

Sir Jon said the existing payments system could be stuck in a “Blackberry world” shortly before an iPhone-style revolution as central banks mull issuing their own digital currencies.

The Treasury and Bank are exploring whether to launch a digital pound as investors pour billions into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Sir Jon said it “looks probable” that the Government would need to issue a "Britcoin" if it wanted to ensure public confidence in future crises with state-backed money.

The vast majority of money held and used in transactions is in digital "private money" issued by commercial banks ,rather than "public money" issued by the Bank in the form of physical cash. However, that access to "public money" is declining as the use of cash falls.

Sir Jon warned that no access to any "public money" in a time of crisis could undermine confidence in the whole system.

A Bank-backed digital currency could therefore shore up public confidence, or they may be “locked into private money”.
