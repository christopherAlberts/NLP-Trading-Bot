Jelena Ivanović Exit Festival 2019







Exit Festival announced that it's joined "the crypto revolution" as one of the first major festivals in the world to make ticket sales available for purchase via the Bitcoin digital payment system.







The event in Novi Sad, Serbia, is also en route to be the first major international festival of the season, July 8-11, with headliners like David Guetta, DJ Snake, Tyga, Asaf Avidan, Eric Prydz b2b Four Tet, Boris Brejcha, Solomun, Sabaton and more, after receiving the provisional green light from local authorities.





With the growth of blockchain, digital currency and non-fungible tokens (NFT’s), the promoters of Exit felt that festivals should adapt and embrace new technologies to cater to their audience needs.





Said Exit Festival CEO and Founder Dusan Kovacevic, "The potential of blockchain, digital exchange and currency is exciting and we wanted to make sure we are at the forefront and are utilising new technologies and able to engage with our tech savvy audience as technology evolves and changes."





Customers are able to purchase festival tickets passes, camping tickets, lockers in exchange for Bitcoins via Exits webshops.
