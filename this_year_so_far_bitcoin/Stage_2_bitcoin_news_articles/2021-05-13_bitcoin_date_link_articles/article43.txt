Another day, another person claiming they’ve created Bitcoin. Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist, has launched a $5.6 billion lawsuit in a London high court to retrieve 111,000 Bitcoins, claiming that he’s the inventor of the cryptocurrency.

Wright has filed the case against 16 developers who were behind crypto networks Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV), Bitcoin Core (BTC), Bitcoin Cash, (BCH), and Bitcoin Cash ABC (ABC). A report from Reuters noted that these networks have wallet addresses in the US, Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.

Several defendants dismissed the case saying it’s “bogus,” and Wright hasn’t proven that he indeed created one of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencies.

Last month, Wright also filed a case against crypto site Bitcoin.org’s publisher Corba for alleged copyright infringement.

Over the years, Wright has claimed several times that he is indeed Satoshi Nakamoto, the author of the original 2008 whitepaper detailing the workings of Bitcoin. But has since failed to prove it substantially. He also claims that in February 2020, his home network was hacked and he’s lost access to encrypted keys to his Bitcoin wallet.

The question still remains, will the real Satoshi Nakamoto please stand up?
