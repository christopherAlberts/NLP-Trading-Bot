Terming it "unfortunate", the appellate tribunal observed that even after the lapse of 981 days and repeated compliance by the Resolution Professional to initiate the liquidation process, the NCLT had not considered it.

A two-member NCLAT bench headed by Acting Chairperson Justice BL Bhat allowed the appeal filed by the Resolution Professional saying fitness of situation allows to initiate liquidation of the corporate debtor K S Oils. "The Appeal is allowed and the impugned order dated Jan. 1, 2021, passed by the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) is set aside and at the same time the order for initiation for liquidation of the Corporate Debtor Ms. K.S.Oils Ltd is also allowed. The Corporate Debtorâ€”KS Oils shall liquidate in the manner as laid down in Chapter-III of the Code," it said.

Earlier, on Jan. 1, 2021, the Indore Bench of the NCLT had dismissed the application filed by the RP of the debt-ridden company to initiate liquidation against KS Oils after it could not attract a buyer within the permissible time frame.

The NCLT had rejected the RP's plea, after 981 days from the date of filing, terming it as not maintainable and being infructuous. This was challenged by RP Kuldeep Verma before the NCLAT. According to RP, NCLT after commencing 31 hearings over its application to initiate liquidation from May 11, 2018, to Jan. 1, 2021, dismissed it despite the mandatory 270 days for completing insolvency had lapsed.

The insolvency resolution process was initiated against KS Oils by NCLT on July 21, 2017, over the plea filed by SREI, a financial creditor.
