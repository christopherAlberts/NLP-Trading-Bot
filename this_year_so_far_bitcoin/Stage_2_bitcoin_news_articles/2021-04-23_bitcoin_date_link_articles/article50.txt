Mercado Bitcoin, Brazil’s largest cryptocurrency platform, will roll out testing of enhanced features of its MeuBank mobile app on April 26.

MeuBank already serves as wallet for investors interested in buying assets that are linked to cryptocurrencies, and the new features will enable users to make investments, pay regular bills, and wire money.

“With this new advance that is going to be launched … people can actually use their cryptocurrencies account to carry out normal operations such as paying utilities bills, for instance, and more will come as soon as it gets the bank status,” Mercado Bitcoin’s legal representative, Marcelo de Callis, told BNamericas.

Mercado Bitcoin started procedures to become a bank years ago and central bank approval, which would make Mercado Bitcoin the country’s first cryptocurrency bank, could come by year-end.

Approval would allow Mercado Bitcoin to offer ATM cash withdrawals and other regular banking services. Currently, the company is registered as a payments arrangement provider and has only limited options.

Central bank governor Roberto Campos Neto is a strong technology advocate and has shifted the institution's focus to fintechs and cryptocurrencies.

Although the institution does not promote cryptocurrencies, it is not hindering them either, de Callis said.

Mainstream financial institutions are also becoming more open to cryptocurrencies, after having them fought for years.

“At first, the cryptocurrencies were seen as revolutionary and dangerous, now they have gone mainstream, and several financial institutions have been allowing this kind of investment,” according to de Callis, who is designing MeuBank’s legal framework.

“This is all in the past now, and we are looking into having a more positive relationship with the banks from now on. They have also vouched for the standard compliance practices of the exchanges,” de Callis said.
