Cathie Wood, the chief executive of ARK Invest and manager of the popular ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund, said that a single bitcoin could be valued at $200,000 more than its current price if more corporations added the cryptocurrency to their balance sheets.

“If all corporations in the U.S. were to put 10% of their cash into bitcoin that alone would add $200,000 to the bitcoin price,” Wood told CNBC on Wednesday.
