The report notes that the vast variation in performance is not healthy for the country’s overall development.

Performance based on infrastructure and social parameters is also disproportionate. Some of the states that stand out are Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra.

Kerala—known for its high literacy rate—scored highest in terms of human development index, while Chhattisgarh and Odisha scored the lowest. In terms of physical infrastructure, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and Kerala scored the highest while Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are still catching up with the leaders.

Odisha, Maharashtra, and Assam managed to maintain a low fiscal deficit between FY11-FY20 (2% or lower). However, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Kerala’s fiscal deficit ranged on the higher side of over 3.5%, according to the report, which attributes the poor discipline to the UDAY scheme.
