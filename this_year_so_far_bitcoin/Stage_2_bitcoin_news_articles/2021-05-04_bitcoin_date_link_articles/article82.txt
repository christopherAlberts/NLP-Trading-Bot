Ether, the cryptocurrency a part of the Ethereum blockchain network, has reached record numbers on Tuesday with a price of $3,456.57, according to a report by CNBC.

Ethereum is currently right behind Bitcoin, with a market capitalization of $405 billion, according to real time data tracked by CoinMarketCap (Note: market capitalization is constantly changing). It experienced a 37.74% surge within the past seven days.

Dogecoin has also recently experienced a big price jump, spiking more than 100 percent last month. One Dogecoin is currently worth $0.53.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao says institutional investors and corporations purchasing cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) could be causing the Ether price to surge, according to a report by Fortune. An NFT is a unique crypto-asset that can be used to authenticate ownership of digital assets like artwork, Tweets, memes and music.

You can purchase Ether on Coinbase. Once you sign up for Coinbase, youâ€™ll also receive $5 worth of Bitcoin for free once you verify your ID.
