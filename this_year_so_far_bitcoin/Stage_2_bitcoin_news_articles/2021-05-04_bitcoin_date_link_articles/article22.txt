An anonymous artist/activist has spent the weekend projecting pro-bitcoin messages onto the walls of the Bank of England and the Houses of Parliament.

On Saturday, Twitter user Dominic Frisby posted a photo showing the Bank of England plastered with a laser projection proclaiming "₿ fixes this". The message is surrounded by a red box and has what appears to be the artist's signature in the bottom right-hand corner.

Fisby later posted a photo showing the same message projected on the Houses of Parliament. The following day, the BofE building was adorned with the words "Money printer go brrrrrrrrrrrr ₿". This has been followed up with "Printing money is stealing from the poor ₿" and "Fiat is the bubble Bitcoin is the pin ₿".

Does the Bank of England even know this is going on? pic.twitter.com/sFvUt8OCtM — Dominic Frisby (@DominicFrisby) May 4, 2021

The mystery messenger has also taken on Covid-19 conspiracy theorists, projecting "Bill Gates is not a homicidal maniac" onto the walls of St Thomas' Hospital and informed the world that "Boris Johnson is just a fat Tony Blair".



The original "₿ fixes this" image is now for sale as a non-fungible token on the Rarible platform. The creator is listed as "Fraz", matching the signature in the images.
