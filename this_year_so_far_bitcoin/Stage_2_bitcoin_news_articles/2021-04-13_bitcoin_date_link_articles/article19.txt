While economists, policy makers and activists are focused on ways to make it easier to build more homes, particularly in those places that are in high demand and have lots of economic opportunity, the growth of the build-to-rent market is a backdoor, market-oriented way to make it happen. Institutional managers of build-to-rent communities can perform upkeep and maintenance cheaper than most homeowners can. With all else equal, that should mean lower housing costs over time than in a world where homeowners are trying to figure out maintenance as problems come up. And by shifting ownership to a handful of institutional owners rather than millions of individual owners, the politics of housing construction should become easier at the local level.
