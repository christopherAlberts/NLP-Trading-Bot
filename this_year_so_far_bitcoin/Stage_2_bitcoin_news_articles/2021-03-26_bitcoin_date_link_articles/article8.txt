Over $6.4 billion options contracts expired today, sending Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) on an upward price trajectory once more, according to a crypto derivative exchange Deribit.

What Happened: The market-leading cryptocurrency was trading at $53,930 at the time of writing, gaining 1.2% within minutes of the contracts expiring.

Bitcoin’s price dipping to under $51,000 yesterday was believed to have been primarily fuelled by selling pressure from those with short positions.

Why It Matters: The majority of these contracts were traded on Deribit, which leads the Bitcoin option’s market by trading volume.

“Majority of puts will expire worthless,” noted Deribit earlier this week, adding that it doesn’t necessarily mean that they haven’t served their purpose as protective puts could be an insurance policy.
