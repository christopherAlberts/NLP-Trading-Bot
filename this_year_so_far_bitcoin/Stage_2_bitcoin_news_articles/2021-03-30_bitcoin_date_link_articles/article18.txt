Bitcoin Accumulated is Undeterred

The question of whether Bitcoin is a legitimate digital asset to hold is no longer a common one in todayâ€™s cryptospace as the cryptocurrency has proven itself sustainable over time. The latest weekly on-chain data from crypto analytics provider Glassnode suggests that the market is seeing the emergence of new crypto HODLers.

Per the data, about 25% of all Bitcoin being traded in the past 6 months are from new coins, as older investors appear to be heralding a longer-term holding policy. Current data also suggests that the outflow of assets away from these exchanges is also a positive signal that suggests accumulation. The sustenance of this trend will stir scarcity which will eventually impact the price of the coin.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is up 2.39% to $59271.1, a trend that suggests a breakout through the $60,000 psychological level is imminent. Consider the BTC-USD 4-hour chart on TradingView.
