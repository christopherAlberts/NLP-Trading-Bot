Popular trader Kaleo thinks Cardano (ADA) will hit all-time highs soon.

The pseudonymous analyst tells his 316,800 Twitter followers that ADA is on the cusp of reversing a long-term dip against Bitcoin’s price, one that dates back to 2018.

“ADA/BTC has nearly completed an entire move back to its recent highs from the dip. Should expect to see new highs soon.

After the BTC pair breaks out, a move back to $2+ and new all-time highs should follow.”

Cardano is trading at $1.72 at time of writing and is down nearly 2% on the day, according to CoinGecko. ADA is up more than 13% in the past two weeks, however.

Kaleo is also bullish on Bitcoin.

“Nothing has changed big picture. I’m still confident we’ll see $100,000+ this cycle.

The accuracy of this chart from early 2019 still amazes me. Every good thing must come to an end eventually, but I still think this thing has some gas left in the tank.”

The highly followed trader also predicts that Dogecoin (DOGE) will continue its surge.

“The way the meme stocks (AMC and GME) are moving higher, it shouldn’t shock anyone that DOGE does something similar. $1.00+ shouldn’t surprise anyone.”
