It‚Äôs my last day in Dubai as permission to travel has finally been granted for Mallorca and Z√ºrich. It‚Äôs been a fascinating visit ‚Äì Crypto AM will be back here for sure! Now all eyes are on the 12,000 attendees converging on Miami for the Bitcoin 2021 conference.

Crypto at a glance

The cryptocurrency market continues to recover today, with Bitcoin (BTC) up more than four per cent over the past 24 hours at time of writing. The leading cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading at just below $39,000 ‚Äì its highest price in over a week. Can it break through the strong resistance forming at $40,000?

In favour of breaking past $40,000 is the Bitcoin 2021 Conference, currently taking place in the self-proclaimed ‚Äòcity of crypto‚Äô Miami. The theory goes that large events are essentially a breeding ground for bullish sentiment, producing a groundswell that drives prices higher. This idea is traditionally associated with Coindesk‚Äôs Consensus event, which took place last month. Unfortunately, this coincided with a significant price crash. Can Miami fare any better?

The good news bear is visiting everywhere today, with most other leading cryptocurrencies seeing gains yesterday. Ethereum is also back up by more than six per cent, currently changing hands above $2,800. This is a level the second largest cryptocurrency has struggled to sustain for the past week. Is it dependent on Bitcoin breaking $40k, or can it forget its own path?

The big gainers today are Polkadot (DOT), Binance Coin (BNB), and Dogecoin (DOGE), which are up around 15 per cent, 10 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. Doge in particular is still riding high off the Coinbase Pro listing and accompanying barrage of tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Maybe he hasn‚Äôt got bored of crypto after all?

Convince your Nan: Soundbite of the day

‚ÄúRight now, if you buy and sell gold, you get it taxed, they can do that. If you make a profit in Bitcoin, you read stories about people being taxed on it. You can‚Äôt tax money, you don‚Äôt tax it. If you bought a dollar a year ago and it went down 10%, you can‚Äôt take a loss because your dollar lost value.‚Äù ‚Äì Ron Paul, former presidential candidate

Solving real problems‚Ä¶

In Venezuela, people are using #bitcoin to pay for basic goods and services. It's a desperately needed medium of exchange in a country ravaged by hyperinflation.
