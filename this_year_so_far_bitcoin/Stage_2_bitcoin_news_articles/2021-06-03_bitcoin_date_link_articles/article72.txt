For this special edition of the “Bitcoin Magazine Podcast,” Matt Odell sat down with Bethany Hamilton and her husband Adam Dirks.

Hamilton is an American professional surfer who survived a 2003 shark attack in which she lost her left arm, before ultimately returning to professional surfing. Hamilton and Dirks both take faith very seriously and when they read “Thank God For Bitcoin” by Jimmy Song and several other Bitcoiners, they started to understand the case for why corrupt money is bad for humanity and how Bitcoin redeems sound money for the world.

“There’s something interesting about Bitcoin where you have to be almost ready for it, ready to hear it,” Dirks explained. “And what it took was that kind of ‘rock bottom’ moment in life and for us that was the pandemic hitting and then our salary getting cut in half. We started questioning everything that’s going on in the government and then we started going down the rabbit hole.”

Both Hamilton and Dirks started taking Bitcoin much more seriously after the book and have recently come out publicly in support of the Bitcoin movement. To Hamilton and Dirks, Bitcoin offers common sense in a financial world that has lost its way.

Please enjoy this wide-ranging conversation between Hamilton, Dirks and Odell.
