The cryptocurrencies have been identified either on their global rankings and market capital or over their popularity among crypto traders. Readers should know that cryptocurrency trading is not banned in India but there is apprehension among traders due to lack of regulations. Recently, RBI has also asked banks and other financial institutions not to quote its old circular that barred these institutions from doing business with cryptocurrency exchanges in India.
