Bitcoin price climbed above the USD 38,000 resistance zone. BTC even broke USD 39,000, but it failed to even test USD 40,000. There was a fresh downside correction and the price is currently (04:40 UTC) consolidating near USD 38,000.

Besides, most major altcoins also corrected gains. ETH topped near USD 2,880 and it corrected below the USD 2,800 support level. XRP/USD is struggling to start a fresh increase and it might decline to test USD 0.95.

Today, Tesla's Elon Musk cryptically tweeted "#Bitcoin" with a broken heart emoji and a meme with a reference to a lyric from the popular song "In the End" by Linkin Park. He later added another meme, showing a trader who is crying because of a price correction. In March, Tesla sold 10% of the BTC holdings it had bought at the start of the year for USD 1.5bn.
