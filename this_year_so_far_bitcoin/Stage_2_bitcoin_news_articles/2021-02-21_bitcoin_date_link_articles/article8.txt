Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $57,109 and the second major resistance level at $57,109.

The pullback saw Bitcoin fall briefly fall back through the second major resistance level at $57,109.

4 days in the green that included an 8.34% rally on Friday delivered the upside for the week.

For the week ahead

Bitcoin would need to avoid a fall through the $53,809 pivot to support a run the first major resistance level at $61,888.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from 21st Februaryâ€™s new swing hi $58,321.2.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended breakout, Bitcoin could test resistance at $65,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $66,400.

Failure to avoid a fall through the $53,809 pivot would bring the first major support level at $49,297 into play.

Barring an extended sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$45,000 levels and the second major support level at $41,219. The 23.6% FIB of $45,501 should limit the downside.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.31% to $56,625.0. A mixed start to the week saw Bitcoin rise to an early Monday high $57,449.0 before falling to a low $56,000.0.
