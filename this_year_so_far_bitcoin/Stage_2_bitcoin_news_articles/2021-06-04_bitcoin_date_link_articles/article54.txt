Thanks to a recent tweet from Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk, Bitcoin has resumed its downward trend after trying to reclaim $40k. Charts provided by Glassnode and CryptoQuant suggest that Bitcoin miners have continued to sell the digital asset.

The data also includes particular mining pools such as BTC.com and Antpool.
