Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has probably bottomed out, according to co-founder of a cryptocurrency research firm Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC, Tom Lee.

What Happened: According to a Wednesday Fortune report, Lee pointed out that Bitcoin's price rose over $2,000 over the weekend "despite another set of negative headlines."

“I can’t help but view this as reinforcing the likelihood Bitcoin has bottomed, given bad news is not creating new lows,” Lee said.

According to Fundstrat's Managing Partner, Bitcoin's price will exceed $125,000 before the end of the year, and the price exceeding $40,000 again will be a confirmation that this year's bottom is in.
