Yesterday, bitcoin surged by an impressive 9% from daily low to daily high, surpassing the $58k mark. This continues the ongoing bullish week for BTC. Just six days ago, on Sunday, bitcoin price plunged to as low as $47k.

Yesterday’s spike allowed bitcoin to climb back above the significant 50-day moving average line, after spending 11 days beneath it. Before this, bitcoin hadn’t seen a daily close beneath the 50-days MA since October 2020.

As a quick recap, BTC broke below the 50-days MA on April 19th and continued to head lower from there until it found support at $47,000 (.5 Fib) last Sunday, as mentioned above.

Earlier today, the bulls encountered a significant resistance area at $58,355, which was the previous all-time high set at mid-February. This resistance was further bolstered by the upper angle of a short-term ascending price channel.

After reaching this resistance, bitcoin retraced over $1000 to where it is trading right now. According to Bitstamp, the daily MA-50 now lies at approximately $56,930. This, together with the $57k horizontal support, is the first major support bulls should look at.

This is a positive sign for the bulls, signals that the uptrend is healthy. This comes along with Bitcoin whales reportedly accumulating Bitcoin below $50k earlier this week.
