“I am officially a DOGE bag holder. Target: $1 Liquidation Price: $0

Game plan: ‘Make it back in 1 trade.'”

According to the tweet, Angelo is down over $8.28 million on his Dogecoin holdings but he says the paper loss is not really a concern.

“Not worried one bit. I am a professional at being underwater.”

The trader also highlights that DOGE, which started as a joke, is now carving out a niche in the crypto sector and developing a clear use case.

“I am officially a Dogecoin maximalist. We are witnessing DOGE become the currency of the internet. Accept it. $1 has been programmed… DOGE continues to bring financial freedom to the masses. If you are against this, that is your problem, not ours.”

As for Litecoin, Angelo believes that the Bitcoin fork is ready to generate gains of over 30% in the short term from its current price of $270.

“Today is a great day to be LONG AND STRONG. It’s also a great day to market buy more Litecoin. See you at $400.”
