Bitcoin Production Update

On May 31, 2021, the fair market value of one bitcoin was approximately $36,857, implying that the approximate fair market value of Marathon’s current bitcoin holdings is approximately $203.4 million.

Miner Installations and Hashrate Growth

As of June 1, 2021, Bitmain has delivered approximately 16,809 S-19 Pro ASIC miners to the Company’s mining facility in Hardin, MT, all of which were delivered on time and as scheduled. During the month of May, Marathon installed 5,571 new miners, increasing the Company’s active mining fleet to approximately 17,655 miners, generating approximately 1.9 EH/s.

New miners continue to be installed on a daily basis. Based on current delivery and installation schedules, Marathon continues to expect all previously purchased miners to be fully installed by the end of the first quarter of 2022, at which point, the Company’s mining fleet will consist of approximately 103,120 miners, generating approximately 10.37 EH/s.

Implementing Bitcoin Core Version 0.21.1 (Taproot)

On May 31, 2021, Marathon announced that the Company’s Bitcoin mining pool, MaraPool, was adopting and implementing Bitcoin Core version 0.21.1, which includes the Taproot soft fork, without modification. As a result, MaraPool will no longer filter transactions. The update is expected to begin this week with Taproot signaling commencing the following week, at which point, the pool will begin validating transactions in a manner consistent with all other miners who use the standard node.

Management Commentary

“In May, we produced 226.6 bitcoins, which is a 40% increase from the 162.1 bitcoins we produced in April, and we increased our hashrate to 1.9 EH/s after installing another 5,571 miners,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s CEO. “As a result, we were producing nearly 10 bitcoins per day on average at the end of the month. Given our current delivery schedule and the macro events affecting the global network hashrate, Marathon is particularly well positioned to scale and thrive in the current mining environment. Delivery and installation of new miners continue to progress well, and we remain on track to meet our objectives of transitioning our operations to 70% carbon neutral and having all our previously purchased miners online by the end of the first quarter of next year.”

Investor Notice

Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and forward-looking statements described under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer.

Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. In addition, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results in the future. Future changes in the network-wide mining difficulty rate or Bitcoin hashrate may also materially affect the future performance of Marathon's production of Bitcoin. Additionally, all discussions of financial metrics assume mining difficulty rates as of June 2021. See "Safe Harbor" below.
