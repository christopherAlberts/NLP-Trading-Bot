That said, any fresh spark for a renewed upside push on the latest bounce still needs to clear the $40,000 level as well as the 200-day moving average (blue line) @ $41,475 otherwise it is unlikely to be sustained - at least from a technical perspective.

That is the highest level since 28 May as buyers look to be forming a base close to the 50.0 retracement level of the big picture upswing in Bitcoin, around $34,378.
