It’s a block (chain) party.

Crypto billionaires, athletes, politicos and more than 20,000 attendees are descending on Miami for the largest-ever Bitcoin conference this week.

Blockchain trailblazers and crypto-curious celebs including Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, computer scientist Nick Szabo, skater Tony Hawk, Floyd Mayweather, and pols like former Congressman Ron Paul and Senator Cynthia Lumis are all slated to speak at the two-day event at Wynwood’s Mana Convention Center.

General tickets, which went for a whopping $1,500, are sold out. Meanwhile, those plunking down $20,0000 for a “whale pass” will get an extra day to rub elbows with other elites, as well as perks like suite tickets to Mayweather’s fight against controversial YouTuber Logan Paul.

“I don’t think anyone expected the event to be as large as it is,” Bitcoin billionaire Brock Pierce — who will be speaking at the event — tells Page Six. “It’s a combination of excitement in the industry of [crypto] going mainstream combined with people desperately wanting to reconnect with other human beings [with COVID letting up].”

We hear the party scene is set to be wild, with yacht parties and huge bashes in the works.

Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has been setting the city up to become a bitcoin hotspot. He has even proposed that the city pay municipal workers and accept tax payments in the cryptocurrency.

“The Mayor has certainly said he is bold and supports innovation,” Pierce says, noting that venture capital firms and tech types flocked south during the pandemic, but now seem like they are there to stay.

“Innovators are looking for a combination of quality of life and also feeling supported by the government … Miami caught the wave. They capitalized on the situation and as a result, the future of Miami is probably forever changed.”
