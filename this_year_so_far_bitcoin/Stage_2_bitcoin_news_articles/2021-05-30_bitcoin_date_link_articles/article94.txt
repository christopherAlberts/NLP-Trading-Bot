First described in 1998, the concept of Cryptocurrency was something completely unknown 21 years ago, a science fiction idea almost proposing to create a new type of decentralized money, one that uses Cryptography as a control system. But it wasn’t until 2009 that a developer named Satoshi Nakamoto – although that’s not his real name – created the first cryptocurrency: Bitcoin.

Digital currency or digital money on the Internet is a medium of exchange other than real money that has properties similar to physical currencies and allows instant transactions and transfer of property without borders.
