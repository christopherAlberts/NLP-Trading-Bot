Early Bitcoin investor and proponent Max Keiser is undeterred by the recent crypto market crash.

In a new interview on The Wolf of All Streets podcast, Keiser says massive money printing and fresh signs of inflation will force companies to increasingly buy BTC this year.

He sees corporations taking part in a Bitcoin buying spree that fuels a 500% price surge by the end of 2021.

“When corporate America really runs out of room to finagle and to escape the Bitcoin reality, they’ve got to make the move. I think it happens in 2021. My price target for 2021 is still $220,000 per Bitcoin. It’s an aggressive price target, but it’s based on the US dollar running into severe trouble.”

Keiser points to MicroStrategy’s initial $1 billion Bitcoin purchase, spearheaded by CEO Michael Saylor, as the tipping point for an era of corporate investment in Bitcoin.

“He’s thrown down the gauntlet. And so now, every CFO and every CEO and every board member of every public company now has to take that on board.”

Keiser also highlights comments from legendary institutional investor Paul Tudor Jones, who says BTC is a digital form of gold that’s likely the fastest horse in the race in an era of inflation.

“Institutions realizing that inflation is in fact not transitory. It’s secular. It’s structural. It’s here for the long haul. And if you’re not protecting yourself, you’re going to be wiped out. And as Paul Tudor Jones said about Bitcoin, it’s the fastest horse in the race, when he’s comparing it to gold for example. So you get this wave – a tsunami of cash – comes back into Bitcoin.”
