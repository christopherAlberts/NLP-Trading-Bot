Small caps primed for correction

Despite inflation fears, data and soaring company profit margins should propel stocks higher

Ongoing optimism that the economic rebound remains on track pushed most stocks higher on Friday, for at least the third day and for some indices for the fourth straight month, as May trading came to a close. The positive sentiment should linger into the upcoming, holiday-shortened trading week.

Investor bullishness overshadowed off-again-on-again concerns that inflation will upend growth, but not all assets performed as well as equities. On Saturday, Bitcoin extended its selloff.

The climbed for a third day on Friday, finishing just 0.7% below its May 4 record close. It was also the broad benchmark’s fourth straight monthly gain. The also advanced for the third day on the final day of last week's trading, closing 0.75% below its May 4 highest close.

The climbed 0.25% on Friday, finishing 2.6% below its record. It was the tech-heavy benchmark’s third monthly uptick. Conversely, the small cap was the only major gauge that closed lower on Friday, 3.8% below its Mar. 15 record. Still, the small cap index notched its eighth monthly gain in a row, for the first time since 1995.

Note that the last two indices we mentioned—which represent the opposite sides of the reflation trade—are each considerably further from their respective records than the other two major indices. That, however, doesn’t necessarily mean they’re underperforming. They may have simply jumped higher, creating loftier records, than the other two.

Actually, that only provides a partial picture. While the Dow Jones and S&P 500 have risen 12.7% and 11.8% respectively so far this year, the NASDAQ 100 gained considerably less, with only a 7.2% boost. The Russell, however, has been the biggest gainer so far in 2021, adding 15.6% YTD.

What this means: there is an argument to be made that technology stocks, normally characterized as growth stocks, might be providing more value than shares designated 'value stocks,’ best represented by the Russell 2000 index, which lists smaller cap American domestic firms. Those smaller caps were the companies that suffered the most during lockdowns, and are therefore also expected to benefit the most from a restarting economy, at least in our proposed time frame.

That is partly why we think the Russell 2000 may be entering a .

The small cap benchmark formed a shooting star as it neared an H&S top.

Even after rose the most in two decades, traders remained focused on the outlook for higher spending that could boost growth. The perception that the latest figures won’t be enough to prompt any change in policy by Federal Reserve officials also helped sentiment remain strong.

The topic of has remained a point of contention for investors and economists alike, with some arguing that price increases are temporary and others anxious about the potential for escalating costs in the longer-term. US President Joseph Biden released his first, full-year last week. It details his ambitions to expand the size and scope of the federal government with more than $6 trillion in spending over the coming fiscal year.

If so much data has been less buoyant than expected and high-profile investors like Warren Buffett continue warning about inflation, why are stocks appreciating? Though the debate continues raging, companies are booking profits and momentum is accelerating.

Indeed, with 97% of S&P 500 firms having already released earnings for their most recent quarters, corporate results are on course to grow by 50% from a year ago, making it the biggest boost for this metric since 2010.

Remember, however, we've warned about making this comparison to last year, given that the frame of reference is an economic shutdown, so any growth will come in artificially higher. However, consensus estimates took into consideration the economic lockdown, and results still beat estimates by a record 23%.

In fact, compared to the prior three quarters, when better-than-expected numbers were a consequence of low expectations, this quarter’s results were a function of loftier earnings, projecting economic strength. Demand rebounded as the number of COVID cases decreased, with vaccinations on the rise and social restrictions loosening. As last week's and data showed, there's pent up demand fueled by a significant amount of excess savings consumers could deploy as normal activities begin to resume.

Putting all this into context—while putting aside for now questions about unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy—the performance of the stock market and corporate earnings are completely in sync, which should provide some comfort to investors. But, if forward, 12-month corporate earnings are already expected to exceed their pre-pandemic level by +11%, is there any more room for growth?

We believe so, based on our expectations for a durable expansion. Following the previous two recessions, corporate earnings continued to grow by an average of 65% once they reclaimed their prior peaks.

But it’s more than just plain ole’ earnings that are boosting optimism...it's record profit margins as well. Automakers, financials, materials—reflation sectors all—have led stocks to surging profit margins.

Then why are we expecting a potential pullback for the Russell 2000, the index that has proven to be most related to the reflation trade? Because it is primed for profit-taking before it continues higher.
