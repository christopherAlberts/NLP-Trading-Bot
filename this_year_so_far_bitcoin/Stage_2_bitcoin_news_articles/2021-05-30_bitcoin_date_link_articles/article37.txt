A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin slide to an early morning intraday low $33,367 before making a move.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $33,000, Bitcoin rose to a mid-day intraday high $36,419.0.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $36,764, Bitcoin fell back to sub-$35,100 levels before finding support.

Bitcoin briefly revisited $36,200 levels before ending the day at $35,600 levels.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact in spite of the recent slide back to sub-$30,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need a sustained fall through the 62% FIB of $27,237 to form a near-term bearish trend.
