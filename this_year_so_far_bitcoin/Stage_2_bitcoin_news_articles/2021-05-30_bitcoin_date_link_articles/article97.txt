Dubai launched its own cryptocurrency dubbed DubaiCoin. The crypto is only trading on a select number of exchanges and a public blockchain will allow people to generate their own DubaiCoin by mining them. The price of Dubaicoin rose by 1,000 percent in the 24 hours to May 29, with the price as of 5.57pm on May 30 standing at $0.2769 with a four percent increase in the last day, according to Coin Ranking. The crypto’s value shot up after a press release circulated claiming it had been named as the official digital currency of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

However, the Dubai Government quickly came out to deny the claims, tweeting that the story was an “elaborate phishing scam”.

The fake statement was going around on Wednesday through a website called DubPay.

The claims said: “DubaiCoin will soon be able to be used to pay for a range of goods and services both in store and online, with the clear intention for the coin to be used in place of traditional bank-backed currencies.

“Circulation of the new digital currency will be controlled by both the city [Dubai] itself and authorised brokers.”
