Falling short of the 38.2% FIB of $41,592 and the first major resistance level at $44,508, Bitcoin slid to a Sunday intraweek low $33,367.0.

Avoiding the first major support level at $27,275 and the 62% FIB of $27,237, Bitcoin found support to end the week at $36,600 levels.

3 days in the green that included an 11.79% jump on Monday delivered the upside for the week.

For the week ahead

Bitcoin would need move through the $36,623 pivot to support a run the first major resistance level at $39,875.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from $39,000 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and last weekâ€™s high $40,884.0 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended breakout, Bitcoin could test resistance at the 32.6% FIB of $41,592 and resistance at $42,000. The second major resistance level sits at $44,136.

Failure to move through the $36,623 pivot would bring the first major support level at $32,362 into play.

Barring another extended sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of the 62% FIB of $27,237. The second major support level at $29,110 should limit the downside.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 2.66% to $34,668.0. A mixed start to the week saw Bitcoin rise to an early Monday high $35,959.0 before falling to a low $34,631.0.

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
