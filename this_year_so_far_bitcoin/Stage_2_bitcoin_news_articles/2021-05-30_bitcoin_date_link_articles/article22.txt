Bitcoin has fallen nearly 40 percent so far this month, taking losses sparked by a growing crackdown in China and environmental concerns.

Bitcoin once fell to US$33,464 (HK$261,019) yesterday morning, before bouncing back above US$36,000 last night. Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, is down 44 percent from the year's high of US$64,895.22 on April 14. Ether, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, slid 0.65 percent to US$2,449.42 as of last night.

Bitcoin has been less volatile in the past week but losses this month have been heavy, driven by growing regulatory pressures on the sector. It is trading at levels last seen in January and at roughly half its peak value.

"Bitcoin is currently in a bit of 'slumber mode' trading in the range of US$34,000 and US$40,000," said Ulrik Lykke, executive director at crypto hedge fund ARK36.

"Many traders are acknowledging that price seems to be range-bound for the moment, why they may be hesitant to take a position with high conviction."

The cryptocurrency has lost more than 37 percent in May, which if sustained would be its worst monthly performance since September 2011.

Its drop was triggered by China's efforts to crack down on mining and trading of cryptocurrencies, and Tesla's move to halt payments over worries about energy use.

Energy regulators in China's Sichuan will soon meet local power companies to gather information on cryptocurrency mining, an official said last Thursday, potentially leading to a clampdown in the country's second-biggest bitcoin production hub.
