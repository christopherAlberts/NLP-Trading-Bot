Bitcoin’s been in the crypto-currency game for over a decade now. There’s no doubt that Bitcoin’s achieved a lot in its years on the market, but not many are aware of some of the more interesting connections it has, especially in the field of entertainment! Bitcoin and entertainment are mainly connected through the gaming niche. Everyone seems to be a fan of gaming nowadays, and Bitcoin’s managed to play a big role in providing excellent old-school entertainment in the form of arcade games! If you’re wondering how Bitcoin and arcades come together, here’s what you need to know.

Bitcoin’s expansion to entertainment

We can’t talk about Bitcoin’s connection to arcades without mentioning Bitcoin’s outreach to the field of entertainment. While many don’t particularly look at Bitcoin as an entertainment source, it’s proven more than once that it’s a big player on the scene. One of the biggest reasons why Bitcoin’s made it big in entertainment right now is its mainstream success! The crypto-currency might have had some trouble gaining access to shops and services in the past, but now most online shops welcome Bitcoin with open arms!

As you can probably already guess, this has opened up many avenues for Bitcoin users, including ways to access top-notch entertainment with Bitcoin. Other than the grand world of gaming, Bitcoin’s now somewhat of a staple when it comes to travel, online gambling, video streaming and even literature! One of the biggest successes Bitcoin has had in entertainment is with the crowd that loves a bit of nostalgia, making it easy to see why Bitcoin and arcades work so well together!

The recent trend of Bitcoin games

Bitcoin games are one of the biggest trends in the crypto scene right now. While it might not be the most profitable trend, it easy to call it the most fun! If you’re looking at Bitcoin games as a way to earn Bitcoin, you might want to go for something with more potential instead. A great alternative could be trying out automated trading platforms like https://bitcoinstorm.io/. Like Bitcoin games, these platforms make earning Bitcoin easy. They use advanced AI to help users find the best investment opportunities and require a minimum effort to get started.

If you’re in it for fun, Bitcoin games are a surefire way to keep yourself entertained. Going back to the arcade connection, Bitcoin games are inspired by classic old-school arcades! Most of these games sport fun pixelated graphics, action-packed gameplay and reward players with Bitcoin for advancing through to the next stages. Sure, the monetary payoff might not be the greatest, but the entertainment value they bring to the table more than makes up for it!

A long-time staple in online casinos

While most people don’t usually think of casinos when arcades are in question, these gambling operators have a lot more to offer than just classic table games. Sure, spending some time on a game of poker can be incredibly fun, but what truly takes the cake in most online casinos are the slots! If you’re not familiar with the online casino scene, modern themed slots take inspiration from arcades! They include fast-paced gameplay, a very similar visual design and plenty of genres players can choose from!

Naturally, the best part about all of this is the status of Bitcoin in online casinos. Bitcoin has been a staple with these operators since its early days, so Bitcoin users should have no problem signing up at an excellent online casino and giving the slots a try. They might not be at the same level as some of the highest-grossing arcade games out there, but they’re certainly some of the best arcade-inspired entertainment you can find right now.
