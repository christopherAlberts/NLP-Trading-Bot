Bitcoin was taking a beating Wednesday, with the No. 1 digital asset experiencing a 40% skid from its recent peak.

But traditional assets pegged to bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.11% and other crypto assets were also taking it on the chin.

The Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF BITQ, +7.71% that recently made its debut, offering exposure to a basket of crypto-related assets, was trading down nearly 10%, with Coinbase Global COIN, +6.78% representing one of its top holdings.

Crypto platform Coinbase was trading nearly 9% lower, and has been down more than 30% since its mid-April listing on the Nasdaq.

A similar fund that holds some of the same companies as BITQ, the VanEck Vectors Digital Transformation ETF DAPP, +6.30% , was down over 8%.

Meanwhile, the popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC, +7.47% was down 14.3%, and a comparable trust product focused on Ethereum, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETHE, +5.95% , tumbled by nearly 25%.

A number ofcompanies that are part of the crypto infrastructure, including those that digitally mine for bitcoin, were seeing double-digit drops.

Shares of bitcoin miners Riot Blockchain Inc. RIOT, +14.08% were down nearly 14%, Marathon Digital Holdings MARA, +12.77% was off almost 15% and Ebang International Holding EBON, +10.29% ‘s stock was down more than 10%.

Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. GLXY, +3.73% , trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, was off more than 8%.

Meanwhile, other companies more tangentially related to crypto, who have placed it on their balance sheets or offer crypto products, were also under pressure.

Tesla Inc. shares TSLA, +1.28% , whose CEO Elon Musk has been a big proponent of crypto and who said that the electric-vehicle maker had invested some $1.5 billion in bitcoin, were down more than 4%. Payment processor Square Inc. SQ, +5.29% was down 4%.

MicroStrategy Inc. MSTR, +15.89% , which has been a big buyer of bitcoin, is down more than 10%, a day after its CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company spent $10.9 million to buy 229 bitcoins, at an average price of $43,663 each.

The enterprise software and bitcoin play, which has said it uses bitcoin as its primary treasury asset, said it now holds 92,079 bitcoins, acquired for $2.25 billion at an average purchase price of $24,450 per bitcoin.

The slide for crypto assets also came amid a sharp slump in assets considered risky, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, DJIA, -0.25% , the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.18% , and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.74% all trading at least 1% lower on the day.

Some were attributing crypto’s broader slide to reports that China was cracking down on digital assets, even as the country is testing a digital yuan.
