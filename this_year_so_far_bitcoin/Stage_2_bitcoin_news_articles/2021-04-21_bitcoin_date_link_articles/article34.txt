Dance music platform Beatport is adding a new payment option: bitcoin. It will start accepting the cryptocurrency in June, which it claims makes it “the first major digital music retailer” to do this. That’s careful wording: there have been DSPs accepting bitcoin for some time, but they have tended to be more niche: download stores like Bittunes and Tradebit for example.

Meanwhile there have also been platforms helping artists to sell music for bitcoin: Imogen Heap’s ‘Tiny Human’ track in 2015 for example. Still, Beatport is the biggest example yet, and its crypto exploration isn’t ending there. It is also getting into the NFTs game, releasing its first – ‘Music for Future Dance Floors’ – on 23 April. It will include exclusive music from artists including Sasha, Charlotte De Witte and Boyz Noize, as well as visual art. A planned series of NFTs will be sold through the Crypto·com marketplace.
