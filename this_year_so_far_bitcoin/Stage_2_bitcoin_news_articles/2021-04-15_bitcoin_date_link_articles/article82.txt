The WisdomTree Bitcoin ETP will track the price of the cryptocurrency and is listed on the XETRA market of the Deutsche Boerse

said it has listed a Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) on the Deutsche Boerseâ€™s XETRA market in Frankfurt.

The asset manager and exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider said the WisdomTree Bitcoin ETP is designed to offer investors a simple way to gain exposure to the price of Bitcoin, with the ETP tracking the spot price of the cryptocurrency.

The listing in Germany also comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mulls whether to approve the first Bitcoin ETF for US investors as a bull run in the crypto markets continues to draw more and more interest to the space.

WisdomTree will also join the BTC etc Bitcoin Exchange Traded Crypto ETP, which was launched on the XETRA market by ETC Group last June and has seen its assets under management swell to over US$1bn.

ETC also offers the Physical Ethereum ETC, which tracks the price of the Ether cryptocurrency, and earlier this week launched the Physical Litecoin ETC to track the price of the Litecoin crypto.
