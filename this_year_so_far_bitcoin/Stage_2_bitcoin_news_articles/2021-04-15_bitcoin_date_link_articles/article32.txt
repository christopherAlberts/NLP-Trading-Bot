It’s time to start selecting assets for our Wealth Preserver portfolio.

It is often said that the best things to own in turbulent times are “real” assets and gold is often put forward as one. But is gold a real asset?

In Questor’s view it is not: a real asset is something that you can use directly and would be useful to you even if you were alone on a desert island. A building you can live in or land that produces food you can eat is a real asset.

The value of other assets depends on other people, on social interactions. This is true even of gold, that traditional “store of value”. A lump of gold is more or less useless to you in isolation. So why does it have value? Why has it always had value?

There are a couple of parts to the answer. The first is scarcity: gold is far less abundant than other natural substances such as coal or iron. Second, it lasts: it doesn’t crumble, decay or rust. These characteristics alone are not enough to make it a store of value, however.

The third and key ingredient is what we will have to call something like social convention: over a very long period societies have tacitly agreed that gold is valuable in a way that is almost entirely divorced from any practical usefulness. In short, I think gold is valuable because I know that you do, and vice versa.

This may sound like a flimsy basis for giving something value but it is of course the same reason for which we value money itself – we know that others will accept it in payment for things we want or need. The advantage of gold over paper money is its scarcity.

In normal times we trust paper money without giving it any thought but high inflation erodes that trust. We remind ourselves that money can be created at will – just as it is being created, in huge quantities, by central banks right now – whereas gold has to be painstakingly discovered underground and extracted. Hence the traditional rush to gold when inflation gets out of hand or when we fear that it is about to.
