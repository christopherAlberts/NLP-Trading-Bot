Six years ago, when I was Technology Correspondent for this newspaper, I flew to San Francisco to interview some of the great and good of Silicon Valley. My first interview was with Nathan Blecharczyk, co-founder of Airbnb, who was already a billionaire. My second was with Brian Armstrong, a software developer who had left Airbnb to set up Coinbase, a digital currency exchange.

Armstrong was 32 and worth a mere few million. Three years before my visit he had co-founded Coinbase, and weeks before I arrived Coinbase opened the first regulated bitcoin exchange in the United States. At the time, bitcoin was trading at about $250 and was struggling to shake off its image as the currency of dark web drug dealers and gun runners.
