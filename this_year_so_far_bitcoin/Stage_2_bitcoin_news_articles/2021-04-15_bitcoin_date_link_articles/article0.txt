BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.

The excitement around Coinbase’s direct listing appeared to be short-lived and bitcoin’s price movement appears to be stuck within the same range as a day ago when the big U.S. cryptocurrency exchange’s shares started trading on Nasdaq.

Coinbase shares (NASDAQ: COIN) soared to as high as $429.54 in its first hours of trading on Wednesday but closed at $328, below the initial opening price at $381.

The deflating passion was reflected Thursday in bitcoin’s spot trading activity: The daily spot trading volume from eight crypto exchanges tracked by CoinDesk dropped substantially, to below $2 billion, from near $5.5 billion on Wednesday.

The center of attention for the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization was Ethereum’s Berlin hard fork. It went live early Thursday.

The upgrade, which sets up the network for the much bigger London hard fork in July, incorporates four Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that tinker with gas prices and allow new transaction types.

Since the upgrade, a consensus bug was found with the Open Ethereum client, which disrupted block production. Coinbase disabled ETH and ERC-20 withdrawals on both Coinbase and Coinbase Pro.

In the derivatives market, open interest in ether’s options market rose to a record $3.3 billion Wednesday. The cryptocurrency’s one-month implied volatility (IV) remained low, meaning that investors expect lower odds of price turbulence in the next month.
