Bitcoin came to life in 2009. More than a decade later, the present day looks back on an enormous amount of development that has built a surrounding industry, complete with other blockchains, assets and solutions. Some folks knew about Bitcoin (BTC) in its early years, while others have jumped on the train in varying droves since then. Looking back through Twitter’s history reveals a few tweets that were far ahead of their time.

In 2010, one Twitter user saw Bitcoin’s potential, yet expressed skepticism regarding its future. Little did they know how common the term Bitcoin would become, surfacing as the topic of numerous mainstream news interviews and reporting.

Just learned about bitcoin.org. Probably won't leave the realm of geeks, but it has some really neat ideas about electronic currency systems — Jacob Farkas (@farktronix) November 16, 2010

Someone else on Twitter thought they were behind the game, back in 2010! The tweet shows a post date of Dec. 1, 2010. Bitcoin’s daily price candle for that day reached a price high of around $0.23 per BTC, according to TradingView’s BraveNewCoin BTC Liquid Index. For reference, Bitcoin reached levels above $60,000 per coin in April 2021.

I might be a bit late to the party but bitcoin is definitely the 2nd most interesting thing I have found in a while. http://www.bitcoin.org/ — Ivor Paul (@Apie) December 1, 2010

Another Twitter user cashed in their Christmas present haul in 2011 for the digital asset. If they held BTC until 2021, their decision likely paid notable percentage returns, based on price action since.

Lastly for this batch of history is a 2009 Twitter post from the now-deceased Hal Finney, who was involved in Bitcoin from the beginning. This retro tweet came on Jan. 21, 2009, shortly after Bitcoin’s Genesis block launched on Jan. 3, 2009. Since then, some assets, such as Monero (XMR), have come into existence, touting greater privacy.
