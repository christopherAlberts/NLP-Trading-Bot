A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to late morning intraday high $37,924.0 before hitting reverse.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $38,884, Bitcoin slid to a late intraday low $34,822.6.

The extended sell-off saw Bitcoin fall through the first major support level at $35,195.

Finding late support, however, Bitcoin broke back through the first major support level to end the day at $35,500 levels.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact in spite of the fall back through to $35,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need a sustained fall through the 62% FIB of $27,237 to form a near-term bearish trend.
