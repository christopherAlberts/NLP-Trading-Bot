Alright, down in Miami this weekend there are two things going on:

-A Bitcoin conference.

You'd think the Floyd Mayweather fight would be the more "lit" of the two, but looking at this video from the kickoff of the Bitcoin conference you may find yourself questioning which event is dominating the Miami scene right now:

Just a surreal video of Max Keiser being introduced. Does it feel cultish? Sure. Does it feel like a video you'd see in the first part of a documentary that details the rise and fall of a "get rich quick" scheme? Sure. However, I'm with Mr. Keiser. I'm not fucking selling. Fuck Elon too.

It does make me feel a bit better that Max Keiser was with Michael Saylor, an incredibly well-respected Bitcoin mind in the crypto space:

And the DJ that started the whole thing off the night before? Paris Hilton.

Bitcoin's hot.
