This past cryptoweek, while five coins led the market over the week prior, bitcoin was stuck in a "digital copper" phase as gold was rallying, and DEX and CEX trading volume exploded in May surpassing USD 2trn. There was talk that crypto markets may be seeing a paradigm shift from pure speculation to tactical allocation, while US-based financial advisers are increasingly recommending investments in cryptos to their clients. The owners of the Coinbase Card can now use it for mobile payments via Apple Pay and Google Pay, Guggenheim plans to launch a new fund that may seek investment exposure to BTC, and meme stocks are back in full force with the AMC price jump which actually may lead some to crypto. And speaking of crypto adoption, Daymak announced its electric car that will come with the ability to mine crypto, Norton will launch an Ethereum mining platform along with a wallet, and a Spanish security company said it developed a top-secret ‚Äúcrypto bunker‚Äù.

As some miners still have hope despite Beijing-backed anti-mining activities continuing to gather pace, with some positivity added following the Sichuan energy meeting, miners fleeing China‚Äôs crackdown may become Kazakhstan‚Äôs gain. Also in China, the latest digital yuan giveaway will see USD 6.2m distributed in Beijing, and a chief architect of the digital yuan discussed a possibility of CBDCs operating on networks like Ethereum or Diem. In the US, the new Acting Comptroller of the Currency wants the US officials to work together to set a "regulatory perimeter" for cryptoassets, while Joe Biden's crypto tax evasion crackdown may also impact non-US traders. A South Korean presidential candidate wants the crypto tax delayed until 2023, and the banks that ruled out working with domestic crypto exchanges may be forced to rue their decisions as crypto exchange commission fees grew tenfold. Meanwhile, the ruling Russian party conducted blockchain-powered online primaries. Oh, and Elon was musking again.

Now let's laugh at some funny crypto jokes.
