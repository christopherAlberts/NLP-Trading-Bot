Undefeated professional boxer Floyd ‘Money’ Mayweather recently spoke at the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami and was booed while speaking on stage. Mayweather’s speech was unappreciated by members of the crowd because he didn’t talk much about bitcoin, and towards the end, Mayweather said he believes another crypto will be “as big as bitcoin one day.”

Attendees of the Bitcoin 2021 conference did not like the opinion of the boxer

Boxing legend Floyd Mayweather has been a fan of digital currencies for a long time, as the boxer participated in an initial coin offering (ICO) and recently launched non-fungible token collectibles (NFT). Mayweather is preparing to have a boxing match with Youtuber Logan Paul, and he recently spoke at the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami.

During Mayweather’s talk on stage, he talked about how blockchain technology and things like NFTs are changing the game. The legendary boxer didn’t talk much about bitcoin (BTC), even though the event organizers had tried to keep the conference “just bitcoin.”

The organizers of the Bitcoin 2021 conference say: “Save conversations about other protocols and cryptocurrencies for outside the conference.”

In fact, the conference agenda calls for attendees to take altcoin discussions outside of the event. However, the first day of the Bitcoin 2021 conference shows that it was impossible to stop the discussions on decentralized finance (defi) and topics like NFTs.

‘With or without crypto, Floyd Mayweather is going to be fine’

Mayweather was also wearing an “Ethereummax” t-shirt as he spoke, which is the ERC20 token team sponsoring Mayweather’s fight with Logan Paul. Towards the end of the discussion, Mayweather told the crowd that he believes that at some point another digital asset will be as big as Bitcoin.

As Mayweather made his statement, a portion of the crowd booed the undefeated boxer because they didn’t like what he had to say.

“Everyone in the cryptocurrency world competes with each other, while I feel like everyone should be able to choose what they want to choose and go with who they want to go with,” Mayweather said, emphasizing that people should work together. “I think one day there will be another cryptocurrency as big as bitcoin,” he added.

As soon as he made this statement, the boos started from the bitcoin maximalist crowd. However, Mayweather was quick to respond and said that he had the right to have his own opinion and that others have that right too.

“No crypto …” Mayweather concluded. “Without any cryptocurrency, I was able to earn a billion dollars. Cryptocurrency or not, Floyd Mayweather will be fine, ”the famous boxer told the crowd.
