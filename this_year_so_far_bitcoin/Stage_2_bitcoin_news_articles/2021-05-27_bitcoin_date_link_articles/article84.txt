This lack of bullish momentum may lead to a continuation of the recent bearish structure since the 40K support break. Even though there is a double bottom around the 30K area, it is still within reason for this level to be taken out over the next few days.

Two important points to consider: First, we chose to avoid the recent buy signal because the RISK is too high. The average risk in recent swing trades has been between 3 and 5K. The size of the recent bullish candle off the 30K low is about 8K points. If we got long around 39K, the price would have to run to 47K to justify the risk. The chances of reaching such a target to justify 1:1 risk are much lower NOW.
