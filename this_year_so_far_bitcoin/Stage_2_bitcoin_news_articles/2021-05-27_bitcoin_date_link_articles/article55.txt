GamerHash (GHX) Token Is Now Listed on Bitcoin.com Exchange

press release

PRESS RELEASE. Bitcoin.com Exchange is thrilled to announce the listing of GHX, being available to trade on the 27th May 2021 at 10:00AM UTC. GHX (GamerCoin) was created by the GamerHash team, as an incentive for the miners within the app and as a reward for carrying out the tasks on the Play&Earn module. GHX will start trading with BTC as a pair.

What is GamerHash?

GamerHash is an ecosystem where gamers can use their computing power to earn Bitcoin. That is the basic functionality of the platform, created in 2017, that has brought together over half a million gamers to this day.

One of the moot points behind the recent GHX token growth is the already working platform supporting over 600,000 registered users. The big number of users (mostly gamers) corresponds with the ease of crypto mining on the platform – you can earn BTC while playing games or watching Netflix. At the same time, you receive GamerCoin as a 20% bonus on top of the BTC you mine. Lower-end PC owners with computers not suitable for mining can join Play&Earn where they can still enjoy crypto rewards when completing simple tasks such as playing games or registering on a GamerHash partners platform. In a nutshell, GamerHash is a self-financing supercomputer – built in a decentralized manner with the help of gamers.

Most recently, GamerHash partnered with Exeedme and became a Silver Partner to Blockchain Game Alliance – one of the most influential Crypto & Gaming associations, where among its members, there is; Sandbox, Enjin, ANRKeyX, Simplex and other top NFT projects. This all boils down to a significant preparation period for future partnerships on top of ones that GamerHash already has with Chainlink and æternity.

The platform is already successful, by means of its abundance of users, but the company CMO Artur Pszczółkowski wants to go deeper and become an “Amazon of NFTs” – the team would like to convince its users to partially spend what they’ve ‘mined’ to purchase their first NFTs. More importantly, the cooperation between Chainlink and GamerHash seems to give new possibilities such as utilizing match outcomes to mint rare NFTs, which can then trade on the GamerHash Marketplace. As previously mentioned, GamerHash would like to allow gamers to trade in the P2P way of their gaming NFTs in a safe environment.

What is GamerCoin (GHX)?

According to Wikipedia, Metcalfe’s law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). Therefore, the high price rise of GamerCoin is not a surprise (with over 600,000 users). The native $GHX ERC-20 token is used as an incentive for the miners within the app, and a reward for carrying out the tasks on the Play&Earn module. Future use cases will consist of getting access to special events within the ecosystem, as well as creating a P2P NFTs marketplace as part of expanding the GamerHash Store (~600 products).

Another strong point about GamerHash and its GHX token is legal compliance. The team managed to have the GamerCoin whitepaper registered by the Maltese financial authorities (MFSA). It’s the first project in the European Union to launch a token within this new regulatory framework of Malta’s MFSA.

Strong Endorsement

Danish Chaudhry, CEO of Bitcoin.com Exchange, shared his views on GamerHash, and their respective token GHX: “From the beginning of the crypto industry, the gaming community has always been an integral part of the mining process, and the team at GamerHash have found a great way to target this group of individuals, and incentivise them for their hardware, and for their hobby, or work in some cases.”



Chaudhry continues on by saying; “We’re very excited to see how GamerHash will continue to empower their vision for the future of wide-scale mining via gamers, and gain further outreach with our outstanding community at the exchange.”

Artur Pszczolkowski, CMO of GamerHash expressed his enthusiasm towards the listing, stating that: “The Bitcoin.com Exchange is an important and well-respected part of the crypto ecosystem around the world. It is a great opportunity for the GH community to expand their trading area. We are delighted to be working hand in hand with such a good project. I hope it’s just the beginning of greater cooperation between us in the future”.
