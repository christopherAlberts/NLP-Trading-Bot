Alison Weick, Chief Marketing Officer at Boxed, says: “This will enhance our customers’ shopping experience as they redeem cash or Bitcoin when shopping for their bulk groceries and household essentials.”

Funding round

Lolli recently closed a pre-Series A fundraising round after pulling in $5 million.

This saw investment from the likes of Seven Seven Six, a venture capital firm co-founded by Reddit executive chairman Alexis Ohanian, Serena Williams’ Serena Ventures, and management company Night Media.

Lolli, which launched in 2018, said it would use the cash to develop its mobile application, and for international expansion.

Adelman commented: “This is an exciting time and opportunity to accelerate adoption and increase accessibility to Bitcoin.”

The raise followed a $3 million seed round led by PathFinder, Founders Fund’s early stage investment vehicle, and including Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary’s Sound Ventures, beauty mogul Michelle Phan, Digital Currency Group, and Bain Capital.
