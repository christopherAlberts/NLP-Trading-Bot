A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to an early morning intraday low $55,300.0 before making a move.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $55,040, Bitcoin rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $58,635.0.

Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $58,101 before easing back to sub-$57,000 levels.

Finding late support, however, Bitcoin moved back through to $57,000 levels to deliver the upside on the day.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact supported by the recovery to $57,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $27,237 to form a near-term bearish trend.
