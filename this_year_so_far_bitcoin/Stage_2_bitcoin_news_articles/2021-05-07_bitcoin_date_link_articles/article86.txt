“In keeping with our commitment to investors to help them better diversify their portfolios,” said Ninepoint CEO and co-Managing Partner John Wilson. “Today we’re providing investors with an easier, more liquid way to invest in bitcoin that more efficiently tracks the underlying bitcoin price.”

Along with the conversion, Ninepoint has also decided on a change in indexes. From the MVIS CryptoCompare Institutional Bitcoin Index (MVIBTC) previously used for the Bitcoin Trust, it has assigned the MVIS CryptoCompare Bitcoin Benchmark Rate Index (MVIBBR) as the standard to value the ETF’s Bitcoin holdings.

The new benchmark uses the top five rated bitcoin trading platforms, as reviewed and rated by MVIS’ CryptoCompare Benchmark Rating. Ninepoint believes that MVIBBR allows for investors to have more transparent tracking of the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin, and is more efficient administratively. Maintained by a well-regarded financial services firm, MVIBBR is considered in the market to be among the primary and reliable indexes to track the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin.

Ninepoint has also announced a new addition to its liquid-alternative product lineup.

Expected to launch on Monday, May 10, the Ninepoint Alternative Credit Opportunities Fund seeks to provide income and capital appreciation primarily through investments in a variety of Canadian, U.S., and international fixed-income securities – including convertible bonds, preferred shares, and structured notes – for short-term and long-term gain.
