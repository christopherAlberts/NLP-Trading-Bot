‘Men in Kilts’

When to watch: Sunday at 9 p.m., on Starz.

Sam Heughan and Graham McTavish star on “Outlander” and team up here for a cute travel series through Scotland. Although the first episode is about cuisine, it’s not all food and whisky; the second is about Scottish sports, and later episodes cover music and witchcraft. If you’ve seen “The Wine Show,” which follows the actors Matthew Rhys and Matthew Goode as they learn about wine, but mostly as they just kind of hang out and make each other laugh, this is very similar, except with more sweaters. Heughan and McTavish seem to be having a ball, and it’s nice to remember a time when road trips were good and normal.

… a few hours, and I like reality show bickering
