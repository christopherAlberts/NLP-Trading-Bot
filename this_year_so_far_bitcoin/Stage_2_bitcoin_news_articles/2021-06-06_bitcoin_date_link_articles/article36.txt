Bitcoin, BTC to USD, rose by 0.67% on Sunday. Partially reversing a 3.55% fall from Saturday, Bitcoin ended the week up by 0.47% to $35,780.0.

A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to a mid-morning intraday high $36,475.0.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $37,365, Bitcoin fell to a late intraday low $35,218.0.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $34,264, Bitcoin found support to end the day at $35,780 levels.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact in spite of the fall back through to $35,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need a sustained fall through the 62% FIB of $27,237 to form a near-term bearish trend.
