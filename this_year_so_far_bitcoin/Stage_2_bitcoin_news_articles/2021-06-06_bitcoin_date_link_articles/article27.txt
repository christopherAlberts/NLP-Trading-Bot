A mixed start to the week saw Bitcoin fall to a Sunday intraweek low $34,160.0 before making a move.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $32,362, Bitcoin rallied to a Thursday intraweek high $39,482.0.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $39,875 and $40,000 levels, Bitcoin fell back to sub-$35,000 levels.

Finding support over the weekend, however, Bitcoin revisited $36,000 levels before ending the week at $35,700 levels.

4 days in the green that included a 4.68% gain on Monday and a 4.39% rise on Thursday delivered the upside for the week. A 6.07% slide on Friday pared some of the gains, however.

For the week ahead

Bitcoin would avoid a fall back through the $36,474 pivot to support a run the first major resistance level at $38,788.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break back through to $38,000 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and last weekâ€™s high $39,482.0 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended breakout, Bitcoin could test resistance at the 32.6% FIB of $41,592 and resistance at $43,000. The second major resistance level sits at $41,796.

A fall back through the $36,474 pivot would bring the first major support level at $33,466 into play.

Barring another extended sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$30,000 levels. The second major support level at $31,152 should limit the downside.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 2.26% to $36,588.0. A mixed start to the week saw Bitcoin fall to an early Monday low $35,487.0 before rising to a high $36,784.0.

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
