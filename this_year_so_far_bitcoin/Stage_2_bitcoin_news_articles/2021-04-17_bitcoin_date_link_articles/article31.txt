Last month, crypto exchange Kraken Co-Founder and CEO Jesse Powell said during an interview that Bitcoin is “going to infinity”. Well, it appears that the people who make the animated sitcom The Simpsons agree.

On March 4, Powell talked about Bitcoin during an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg TV, and when asked how high the price of Bitcoin could eventually go to, he replied:

“Of course, we can only speculate, but when you measure it in terms of dollars, you have to think it’s going to infinity… I think pretty soon people are going to be start measuring the price of things in terms of Bitcoin, and I think the true believers will tell you that it’s going all the way to the moon, to Mars, and eventually will be the world’s currency. So, we won’t be measuring the price of Bitcoin in terms of dollars, but in terms of what else you’re going to be buying with it…“

Well, in Sunday’s episode of The Simpsons, which was titled “Burger Kings”, as Marge Simpson is watching “CRAZY CA$H” (a parody of CNBC’s “Mad Money with Jim Cramer“), you see the ticker at the bottom of the screen showing a green infinity symbol next to “BITCOIN” as you can see below:

ICYMI, The Simpsons says #bitcoin price is up by infinity! That might be the 19th time it accurately predicts the future.@AlJean, can I play a cameo to explain $BTC in the next episode 😂
