It is as yet unclear what impact the peaceful, relentless and resilient farmers’ struggle across the Hindi heartland and the three borders of Delhi, and the campaign by their top leaders in Bengal, will have on the assembly polls in the various phases here stretched from March 27 to late April.

However, it is more than apparent that their catchy message is more than symbolic, and is slowly gaining ground across the many layers of voters, especially the young.

There is a striking similarity between the farmers’ appeal and the singular appeal made by the ‘No Vote to BJP’ campaign led largely by students, intellectuals, teachers, and civil society groups in Kolkata. If language is a strong link in terms of messaging, the slogan in original Bengali has a deeper linkage in terms of mass communication: ‘BJP ke ektao vote deben na’, or, simply, not one vote should be polled for the BJP.

The campaign apparently has committees in several districts in Bengal and plans to reach out door to door, though, as of now it has been active in Kolkata, with its videos becoming viral on social media. Their recent rally, finally positioned in the heart of the city across the old lanes near Elite Cinema, was big, pulsating and emotionally intense.

Young women and men, openly called upon the people not to vote for a party with such a bad record as in Gujarat 2002, and how its government has jailed young scholars, intellectuals, writers, and dissenters on cooked up charges and with no evidence. Farmer leader like Balbir Singh Rajewal joined the rally and led it from the front.
