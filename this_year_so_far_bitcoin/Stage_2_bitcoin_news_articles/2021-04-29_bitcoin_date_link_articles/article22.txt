Bitcoin is known for many things, but gaming is probably one of the furthest things from anyone’s mind when they think of it. While most people don’t usually connect the two, Bitcoin and gaming are surprisingly in sync. With the popular cryptocurrency becoming more mainstream each day, users now have plenty of ways to access top-notch gaming content through Bitcoin. Whether it’s through hybrid games that mix the two worlds up or the simple act of buying a video game with Bitcoin, here’s how you can start your Bitcoin gaming journey right now.

Update Your Rig

If you’re serious about gaming, then you need to start things off on the right foot. Of course, this means setting up a top-notch gaming rig where you can enjoy the latest and greatest titles currently on the market. Luckily, there are plenty of tech shops out there that accept Bitcoin as payment, including the online shop Newegg! By taking a look around at these premium stores, users can find fully loaded gaming computers, desks, monitors, consoles, and much more! Find the right parts, and build an entertainment system that will make gaming a next-level experience!

Try Bitcoin Games

If you’re more of a casual gamer looking for a way to kill some time, then you can try the recent trend of Bitcoin games. Bitcoin games are browser minigames, so you don’t need an expensive computer to run them. These fun titles are inspired by old-school arcade games, so they can be a fun pastime with a hint of nostalgia. Of course, what gives these games an edge is their rewards system. Players that do well and clear the levels of Bitcoin games are rewarded with Bitcoin payments!

While earning Bitcoin by playing Bitcoin games is a real possibility, it’s good to note that the Bitcoin rewards are small. If you’re in it for profit, you might want to try a better option like automated trading. By using automated trading apps such as Yuan Pay Group, you can make an excellent passive income without putting too much effort into the activity. The advanced AI tech in these apps can search for profitable investments on the markets and take them automatically if they’re within your set parameters!

Test Your Luck

If you’re looking to play games that never go out of style, then you might want to give games of luck a try. While they aren’t traditional video games, virtual versions of popular titles like Poker, Blackjack, Roulette, and slots are thriving in online casinos! Since most online casino operators are Bitcoin-friendly, you can dip into your stash, place a bet, and see where things take you! Don’t be afraid to try out the excellent range of titles these places host, but keep in mind to always stay safe and play responsibly.

Buy Video Games

If you’ve set up your gaming rig to perfection, it might be time to get access to some of the best games on the market. Luckily, most modern video games boast insanely realistic graphics, in-depth storytelling, and exciting gameplay! On top of this, with video games diversifying their products to draw in new audiences, it’s easy to find top-notch games out there in pretty much every genre imaginable! There’s something out there for everyone, and of course, all of it is available through Bitcoin.

Bitcoin users that are fond of console gaming have it easiest. Since both the Microsoft Xbox Store and the Playstation Network are Bitcoin-friendly, they can snag games directly from the source. Things with PC and most other consoles might take an extra step, but it’s certainly worth the trouble. Online crypto shops like Keys4Coins host pretty much every popular title for most devices. By visiting these shops, users can find some of the best games for PC, the Nintendo Switch, and much, much more!
