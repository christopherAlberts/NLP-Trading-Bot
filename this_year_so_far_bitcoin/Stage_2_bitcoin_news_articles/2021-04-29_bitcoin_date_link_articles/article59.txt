A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning intraday high $55,222.0 before hitting reverse.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $56,222, Bitcoin slid to a late intraday low $52,377.0.

The sell-off saw Bitcoin fall through the first major support level at $53,707 and the second major support level at $52.554.

Finding late support, however, Bitcoin broke back through the second major support level to end the day at $53,500 levels.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact supported by the partial recovery to $55,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $27,237 to form a near-term bearish trend.
