HONG KONG / ACCESSWIRE / April 29, 2021 / Leading crypto derivatives exchange Bexplus has launched a 100% deposit bonus promotion to all traders, to help traders earn more cryptocurrency. If the user deposits 1 BTC, 2 BTC will be credited to his account. Every user can get up to 10 BTC for each deposit.

Bitcoin's high volatility had made a comeback and currently presents more opportunities for traders to make profits. Taking advantage of the price swings and leverage offered by brokers, trading can easily generate 100% or even 1,000% ROI. It's important to point out only traders who know what they are doing can get to these returns consistently.

How Does Leveraged Trading Work?

Assume that 1 BTC is used to open a long contract when Bitcoin is trading at $10,000. Please note that with 100x leverage, 1 BTC can open a contract worth 100 BTC.

One day later, the price of Bitcoin increase to $10,500.The profit will be ($10,500 - $10,000) * 100 BTC/$10,500 *100% = 4.76 BTC, making the ROI 476%.

Now, with Bexplus' 100% bonus, the initial investment would be 2 BTC, and the realized profit made with these 2 BTC will be 9.52 BTC, and the ROI will also be doubled to 952%.

With leverage, it's important to be vigilant, as returns can be outstanding, but liquidations are easier if the price moves down.
