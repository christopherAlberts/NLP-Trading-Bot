He said: “With my current level of wealth and current expenses, I felt this was not a very high-risk situation. I felt comfortable that the worse-case situation could happen versus not making this decision and seeing the opposite.”

He consulted his advisors at Cyndeo Wealth Partners — particularly CEO and president Matt Kilgroe and vice president Nate Johnson. Kilgroe said that as they did the modelling, they looked at it like he was taking this money and putting it into a business with “tremendous upside, but with a lot of risk”.

He added that giving Culkin a green light “is not a common recommendation at all from our standpoint,” but that for this client they felt it was appropriate.

“We’re being, to some extent, forced to have this conversation with clients,” Kilgroe said. “Sean is on one extreme with his knowledge and amount of expertise. Other clients used to just ask about [bitcoin] as a joke, but now it’s, ‘Should I own some?’”

Russell Okung became the first NFL player to be partially paid in bitcoin in 2020, splitting his $13 million salary between cash and the cryptocurrency. Culkin and Okung, now a free agent, were teammates on the Los Angeles Chargers from 2017 to 2019.
