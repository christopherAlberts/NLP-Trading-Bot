Don’t raise the issue with your sister unless you’re prepared to rehash the dynamics of your childhood. Check in with your kids instead. Ask how they feel about this. You may be surprised to learn that the care you took in treating them equally will pay off now when others don’t.

Friend or Foe?

My neighbor bought a brand-new Range Rover that costs $150,000. She used to drive a Chevy Suburban and rarely waved when she passed. But now that she’s got new wheels, she goes out of her way to let you know she’s there: waving and eye contact. I find her self-boosting unfortunate and annoying when so many people are unemployed and struggling. What would you do?

It’s entirely possible that your neighbor is a materialistic braggart who is waving to draw attention to her fancy new car. It’s also possible that you are plagued more by envy of her than by concern for the unemployed and struggling.

Let me play Pollyanna: Ever since we went into pandemic seclusion, I’ve been much friendlier to people on the street, waving and sometimes even speaking to strangers as I pass. (Don’t worry: from a distance!) It stems from a pent-up desire to connect, not a wish for anyone to admire my chic new parka. I would wave back at your neighbor.

A House Divided Over Vaccines

My husband and I are over 75-years-old with risk factors for serious illness if we’re infected with Covid-19. Soon, I will receive the second shot of my two-dose vaccination. But my husband was raised to be distrustful of vaccines, and he refuses to be vaccinated. I don’t expect his attitude to change. I look forward to vacations and visits with family and friends after my immunity builds. I’m sure my husband will want to join me, but he will still be at risk. What should I do? (My son tells me his father made his choice, and it’s not my responsibility. I’m not so sure.)
