After an initial investment of around $3000 two and a half years ago, Sonia Sexton was eyeing off an $8500 windfall. Her risky bet on the wild and woolly world of cryptocurrencies appeared to have paid off, promising a return even the most ambitious investors would be pleased with.

But after months of dead ends, frustration and unanswered emails from online cryptocurrency exchange MyCryptoWallet where she first made her investment, the 60-year-old pensioner has given up on ever seeing her money again.

“It just worries me how many other people would have been caught like me,” she says.

Indeed, cases like Sexton’s are commonplace in the cryptocurrency investing space. Facebook and Twitter are frequently strewn with users searching for answers over why exchanges have suddenly gone dark, leaving them out of pocket with their accounts inaccessible.
