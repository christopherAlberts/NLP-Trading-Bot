There comes a time “in the life of every cryptocurrency investor… when they watch a significant amount of their money disappear in the span of a few hours”, says Jen Wieczner in New York magazine.

Bitcoin fell by 30% last week and is down by more than 40% from its mid-April highs. The past week has seen a stomach-churning series of rallies and reverses, including a 30% fall in a single day on 19 May.

Bitcoin is a poor store of value

At the time of writing bitcoin was still well short of $40,000; it traded as low as $31,970 at the weekend. The price has been hit by news from China, where regulators last week banned banks and payment companies from accepting cryptocurrencies. Elon Musk’s Tesla also says it will no longer accept payments in bitcoin because of the environmental impact of bitcoin mining.

Even after this fall, a person who bought the cryptocurrency five years ago is still “sitting on gains of over 6,000%”, says Aaron Back in The Wall Street Journal. The “libertarian cryptoevangelists” hope digital currencies will one day replace government-issued money. But this bout of extreme volatility is a reminder that bitcoin is a lousy store of value or means of exchange.
