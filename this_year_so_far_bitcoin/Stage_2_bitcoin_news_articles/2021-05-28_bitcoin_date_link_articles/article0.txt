Bitcoin took another hit on Friday as other cryptocurrencies including ether and doge also saw their values fall. The price of bitcoin hovered around $36,000 on Friday. Bitcoin traded 7% lower at $35,997.72 by 4:10 p.m. ET, according to Coin Metrics data. Elsewhere, ethereum's price fell 9.3% to $2,501.16 a coin, while dogecoin's price fell 4% to 32 cents. Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency has been trying to recover after a week of turmoil that saw its price tumble 30% to around $30,000 last week.

It briefly climbed back above $40,000 on Wednesday before losing some of those gains. Cryptocurrencies continue to divide opinion. In a 41-page note last week, Goldman analysts shared their views on whether the likes of bitcoin and ethereum should be considered an asset class or not. The latest price falls comes a day after longtime bitcoin bull Cathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Investment Management, argued that bitcoin has a place in the world of deflation. Emerging markets — where currencies are often linked closely to commodity price cyclicality — could ultimately spur outperformance in bitcoin, she said. "I think what will happen as their currencies come under pressure, the velocity of their money will increase as more and more of their populations shift into bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies and assets," Wood said at CoinDesk's Consensus 2021 conference on Thursday.
