Investing In Wealth & Health Entrepreneurs are a high-risk group whenever the markets catch a cold. Here’s how they invested to keep themselves, and their companies, in the pink of health.

Jyotsna Uttamchandani, Executive Director, Syska Group “If I had to stress about investing in something this year, it would be health. A gym, at this point, is accessible to us on our smartphones. We can always do group exercise classes online or even group challenges for steps with our friends. From a business point of view, investing in AI solutions to drive productivity will be a year-round focus. It will prioritise product sales, optimise our pricing, and provide seamless forecasting.”



Gautam Das, CEO, Oorjan Cleantech “I have participated in almost 50 marathons, including an 87-km comrade run. Spending time outdoors — running, doing yoga or meditation, swimming or playing a sport — is how I invest in my mental and physical well-being. Good health is the biggest wealth. I believe in financial investments in new ventures that create value and jobs. Success and money are the by-products.”



Dhruvil Sanghvi, CEO, LogiNext “In 2021, I am going to double down on efforts to maintain good health by regular exercise and meditat ion. For our employees too, we are envisaging more ways for people to invest in their mind and body. As for wealth, I actively help upcoming technology entrepreneurs with mentorship and angel investments. I’ll be expanding horizons here to build more pathbreaking global companies from India.”
