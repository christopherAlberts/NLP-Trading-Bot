Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) prices were up 8.6% on Thursday to near $60,000 after Square Inc (NYSE: SQ) announced a new Cash App feature allowing users to instantly send bitcoin to other $cashtags for free.

What Happened? On Wednesday, Cash App said its users can now instantly send bitcoin for free on their app.

To promote the feature, the company also announced a new contest in which it's giving away $1 million in bitcoin to anyone who follows @CashApp on Twitter and retweets this tweet along with their $cashtag and the hashtag #CashAppBitcoin.

What’s Next: Square investors will be watching closely to see how many users Cash App Invest and the bitcoin giveaway contest have attracted to get a sense of how much of a long-term growth opportunity the service could be.

Square is expected to report first-quarter earnings in early May.
