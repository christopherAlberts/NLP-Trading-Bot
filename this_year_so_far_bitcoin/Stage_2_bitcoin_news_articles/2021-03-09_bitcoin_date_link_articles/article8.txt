IMHO, green wave-c of B is now underway or has possibly already been completed, and red wave-c should ideally target around $41K. Why is that? Because 4th wave (black major-4) often retrace approximately 23.60-38.20% of the prior, same degree 3rd wave (wave-3), shown with the black box. Besides, C-waves are usually equal to the length of the A-wave. Since red wave-a went from $58.4K to $42.9K, and the current red wave-b rally should typically top around $54.7K to $ 56.1K, the next leg lower (wave-c) should thus target about $39.2-40.6K. Are you still hanging with me?! As you can see, this price target range fits well with the 23.60% retrace level mentioned prior.

C-waves can, however, extend and, in this case, go as low as $29.8K, which is close to the 38.20% retrace at $32.2K, but for now, I prefer the upper end of the black box as in Bull markets downside often disappoints and upside surprises. How do we know the next leg lower is in order? It is confirmed on a move below the end of red wave-a low, but warning bells will already be ringing on a break below yesterday’s low ($49.3), followed by a break below the green wave-b low at $46.3K.

Now, BTC can have one more trick up its sleeve as 4th waves of this magnitude are often more a sideways affair where recent gains are digested more in price than time, i.e., a trading range is made. This means the red b-wave/bounce can even target as high as $64.3 (ranging from $56.9 to $64.2) before that pesky C-wave takes hold, i.e., “the rug gets pulled from under,” as they say, bringing the price back to $40+/-2K once again. That would be called an irregular flat in EWP terms: see here. How do we know if this tricky B-wave pattern is evolving? Break and daily close above the ATH, with the first warning on a daily close above $55.9K.
