The Lake of the Ozarks draws all types for fun on the water as well as national conventions at the area's convention hotels. And this summer, Bitcoin miners will converge at the the Lodge of Four Seasons, for a two-day "Miners Summit."

The most well-known cryptocurrency in the world, Bitcoin is built on a system independent of national fiat paper currencies. The digital system operates in a framework of rules that create new Bitcoins over time, with a final cap on the number that can be created. Bitcoin "miners" are people who participate in that system, which rewards computers that secure the decentralized Bitcoin transactions the most quickly, with a chance to earn the next new Bitcoin created.

If that makes no sense to you, then the press release below will read like a foreign language; on the other hand, if you knew all of that and have a nuanced disagreement... well, you're probably one of the people going to the Miners Summit on June 15-16.
