Buy gold and Bitcoin, we advised in our last Wealth Preserver column. Yes, but how, many of you asked.

Gold

Gold has been around for longer so this is the more straightforward asset to buy. There are a number of possible ways and to some extent it is a matter of personal preference.

There are investors who believe that the only really secure way to own gold is to have it under your direct control under lock and key. This is of course possible – just be sure to buy from a reputable dealer and have appropriate security and insurance in place.

But our portfolio exists to guard against inflation – it is not the kind of “Armageddon portfolio” that might require you to be able to put your hands on assets such as gold bars at a moment’s notice. We want to be ready for a significant rise in the retail prices index; we are not preparing for nuclear war or the collapse of society.

We are therefore ready to trust that the financial services industry will be operating as normal and that investments offered by regulated entities are safe enough ways to invest in the kind of assets we have in mind as protection against inflation.
