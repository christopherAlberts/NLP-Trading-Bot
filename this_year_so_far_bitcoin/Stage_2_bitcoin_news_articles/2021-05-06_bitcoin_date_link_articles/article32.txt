SafeMoon continues pushing forward in the crypto world by overtaking Bitcoin on CoinMarketCap as the number one watched coin. On top of working on a dedicated wallet, SafeMoon recently finished its CertiK audit and is now listed on seven exchanges including MXC and ZBG.

As of today, SafeMoon has over 1.3 million watchers on CoinMarketCap versus Bitcoin’s 1.2 million — which is quite impressive given the DeFi Token’s age. As one of the fastest-growing alts, SafeMoon has been trading sideways for weeks since its drop after a massive spike, and the last 24 hours saw some of that star power return as it lifted off some 50 percent creating a bullish frenzy for its 1.6 million holders.

In other cryptocurrency news, crypto expert predicts that Bitcoin will eventually hit $1 million USD per coin.
