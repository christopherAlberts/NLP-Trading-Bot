Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP fight back – crypto movers and shakers

Posted on April 26, 2021 by Jonathan Symcox share

The value of the most popular digital currencies is bouncing back after dramatic falls last week.

Following reports that American President Joe Biden plans to increase taxes on the rich, the crypto market was a sea of red last week as BTC dropped below $50,000.

However after the weekend, BTC reclaimed some of the lost ground and is back up to almost $52,500, down more than 7% on a week ago. At the time of writing (7am), it has climbed almost 6% in 24 hours.

Ethereum (ETH) is valued at $2,469, up almost 13% in 24 hours and almost 9% higher than seven days ago.

Ripple (XRP) is worth $1.16, up more than 10% in 24 hours but still 24% down on this time last week.

Headline-grabbing Dogecoin (DOGE), which last week broke the 40c barrier after an astronomic rise before falling right back to almost 20c, is worth 27 cents – down 4% in 24 hours.
