When three gunmen smashed through the skylight of a Stockholm cash depot before escaping with millions of kronor, it set in motion a chain of events that would transform the future of Sweden.

The 2009 “Västberga helicopter heist” is known as the most audacious of a spate of robberies that hit Sweden during the 2000s. Today, its legacy lives on because it cemented the idea among Swedes that cash had become an incentive for crime.

That idea is partly responsible for Sweden becoming one of the top five countries where cash is used the least.

“No cash” signs are a frequent feature in central Stockholm. In 2018, just 1pc of Sweden’s GDP was circulating in cash, compared to 11pc across the eurozone.

The trend is being mirrored in the UK. Cash withdrawn from ATMs fell 60pc during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Bank of England.

Now, both nations are on a quest to understand how a new type of digital currency can stop the countries’ central banks being sidelined in the future of money.

“Because of this rapid decline in cash usage, we might end up [in a situation] where the state has no direct role in the payment market and we think that could cause some problems,” says the Riksbank’s Mithra Sundberg.
