Asian stocks and European and American futures drifted upwards as attention turned to the falling bond yields and the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. Dow Jones, S&P 500, and DAX index futures rose by more than 0.10% while the Nikkei 225 and Hang Seng rose by more than 0.15%. In the United States, the yield on the 10-year and 30-year government bonds declined to 1.56% and 2.23%, respectively. The market is also eying important corporate earnings, with top companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, Visa, Novartis, Apple, and Facebook set to publish their results.

The Fed decision is a key mover. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will start its monetary policy meeting on Tuesday and publish its results on Wednesday. This will be an important meeting because recent data from the United States like inflation, retail sales, manufacturing, and industrial production have been relatively positive. Therefore, the market will be focusing on whether the Federal Reserve will change its language. Furthermore, several banks such as Norges Bank and the Bank of Canada have already started shifting tone on their policies.

The economic calendar will be muted today, with minimal earnings and macro data. In the United States, the statistics agency will publish the latest durable goods order numbers. In total, the market expects the data to show that durable goods orders rose from -1.2% in February to 2.5% in March. A strong reading will be positive for the US dollar. In Europe, the ifo Institute will publish the latest sentiment data from Germany. The business climate index, current assessment, and business expectations are expected to rise to 97.8, 94.4, and 101.3, respectively. Traders will also be focusing on the cryptocurrency industry, where the main currencies are bouncing back.
