Bitcoin has fallen sharply from an all-time high, hitting younger investors – who are twice as likely to buy cryptocurrencies as stocks – the hardest.

After hitting a peak of more than $63,000 (£46,000) per coin earlier this month, the price of Bitcoin has fallen by a fifth, trading at $53,000 on Monday.

That slump has hit younger investors who have been the most enthusiastic backers of cryptocurrencies. According to research from Charles Schwab, a stock broker, 51pc investors aged under 37 trade cryptocurrencies while just 25pc buy stocks. By contrast, only 8pc of over-55s have dabbled in digital assets.

On CoinCorner, a Bitcoin broker, 75pc of users are under 44 with 25-34 the most common age group. Just 6pc of its users are over 65.

The survey of 1,000 also found that 70pc of young investors now viewed cryptocurrency as a good investment option, with one in three buying more this year compared with just 10pc who were selling.

Cryptocurrencies have taken off this year. Even after its recent fall, the price of Bitcoin, the largest and most well-known, is up 70pc, and other more niche coins, such as Dogecoin, Ether and XRP have soared even higher.

But the burgeoning popularity of digital assets is a concern for Richard Flynn, of Charles Schwab, who said more and young people were speculating rather than investing.
