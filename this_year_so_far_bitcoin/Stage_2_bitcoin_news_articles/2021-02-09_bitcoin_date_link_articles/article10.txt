British Airways says it will operate transatlantic flights partially powered by sustainable fuels as early as next year, our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham writes.

BA will invest in a new US plant to be built in Georgia by LanzaJet producing commercial-scale volumes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), made from ethanol derived from agricultural and other waste.

The airline said the fuel would create 70% less carbon emissions than conventional jet fuel.

However, it is likely to only provide a tiny fraction of BA’s overall fuel needs at first.

SAF can be used to substitute for up to 50% of conventional jet fuel but so far demonstration flights – such as one conducted in 2018 by Virgin Atlantic with LanzaTech (from which LanzaJet was spun off) – have blended only about 5% of the greener fuel.

BA’s owner, IAG, which has pledged to invest almost £300m in SAF as part of its pledge to decarbonise by 2050, said it would investigate building a refinery with LanzaTech in the UK, as well as a waste-to-fuel plant in partnership with Velocys
