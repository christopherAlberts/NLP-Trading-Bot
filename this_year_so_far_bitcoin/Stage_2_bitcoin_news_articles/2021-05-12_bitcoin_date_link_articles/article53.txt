Ethereum continues to rally in a tight upside channel. All pullback attempts have been quickly bought in recent days, and Ethereum managed to maintain strong upside momentum.

Meanwhile, RSI has moved into the extremely overbought territory, and the risks of a pullback continue to increase. RSI is already close to the extreme highs that were reached back at the beginning of 2021. However, it should be noted that Ethereum had a short pullback in January of 2021 and quickly returned to growth after RSI moved closer to the moderate territory.

Today, Ethereum faced some resistance near $4370. A move above this level will signal that Ethereum is ready to continue its upside move. There are no strong resistance levels in the nearby as Ethereum is moving through record highs.

On the support side, the previous resistance at $4150 will serve as the first support level for Ethereum. In case Ethereum declines below this level, it will head towards the next support at $3775. A move below the support at $3775 will open the way to the test of the support at $3600.
