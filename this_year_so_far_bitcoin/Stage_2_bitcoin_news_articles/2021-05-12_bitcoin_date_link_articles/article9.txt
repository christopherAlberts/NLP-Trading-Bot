Whitfield Diffie in 2019

As defined by the New York Times: "Public-key cryptography is a method for scrambling data in which each party has a pair of keys, one which can be publicly shared and the other which is known only to the intended recipient of a message. It is possible for anyone to encrypt a message using the individualâ€™s public key. However, the message can only be unscrambled with the aid of the private key held securely by the recipient of the message."

Diffie continues to be active in the crypto space today.
