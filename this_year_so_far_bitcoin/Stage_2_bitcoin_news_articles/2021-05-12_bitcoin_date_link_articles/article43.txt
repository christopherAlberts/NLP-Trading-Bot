Crypto at a glance

After a brief dip yesterday, Ethereum has come roaring back to another new all-time high of more than $4,300 this morning. It now has a market capitalisation of just below $500 billion, which makes it the 16th largest asset in the world. That puts it above JP Morgan and Visa and means the smart contracts giant is now bigger than any bank. How much further can it climb?

Ethereum‚Äôs latest push puts its market dominance at over 20 per cent ‚Äì the highest it‚Äôs been since February 2018. The swing away from Bitcoin comes as the leading cryptocurrency continues to trade sideways. It‚Äôs up three per cent over the last 24 hours to $57,000, remaining in that corridor between $50k-$60k where it‚Äôs spent much of the past three months.

None of this is to say that things are quiet with Bitcoin at the moment, with institutions and the retail market alike continuing to pile in. It was reported yesterday that software giant Palantir is now accepting Bitcoin as payment and that investing in it as a treasury reserve asset is ‚Äúdefinitely on the table‚Äù.

A new NYDIG survey also found that roughly 17 per cent of the adult population in the US own at least some Bitcoin ‚Äì about 46 million Americans. Has Bitcoin finally gone mainstream?

The big gainer yesterday was eos (EOS), which is up 44 per cent at time of writing ‚Äì an 83 per cent gain over the last seven days. Blockchain software firm Block.one has announced plans to launch a cryptocurrency exchange subsidiary ‚Äî dubbed ‚ÄúBullish Global‚Äù ‚Äî will run on the EOS blockchain. The EOSIO developer revealed that it had raised capital to the tune of $10 billion for the crypto exchange.

Convince your Nan: Soundbite of the day

‚ÄúWell, you probably don‚Äôt remember this joke, but five or six years ago, I said that that crypto was a solution in search of a problem. And that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt play crypto the first wave because we already have the dollar. What do we need to look for? Well, the problem has been clearly identified. It‚Äôs Jerome Powell and the rest of the world, central bankers. There‚Äôs a lack of trust. So sort of groping for an answer for a central case.‚Äù ‚Äì Billionaire hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller
