Softbank founder Masayoshi Son spoke out about the adoption of Bitcoin, underlining that uncertainty remained for the top cryptocurrency.

Softbank was the latest global firm to share its views on the popularity of Bitcoin and the potential adoption of the cryptocurrency.

«There’s a lot of discussion over if it’s a good thing or a bad thing, what’s the true value or is it in a bubble,» said Masayoshi Son during Softbank’s recent earnings conference.

«Honestly speaking, I don’t know.»

«Can’t Be Ignored»

Despite the uncertainty, Son noted that Bitcoin’s popularity has transformed it into a platform that «can’t be ignored» like diamonds or bonds.

«There’s no need to reject [the cryptocurrency either],» said. «We are always having such internal discussions.»

Financial firms aside, numerous global tech firms are also increasingly exploring Bitcoin opportunities – particularly as a payment method – such as gaming console Xbox and electric vehicle company Tesla, though the latter recently suspended car purchases using the cryptocurrency.
