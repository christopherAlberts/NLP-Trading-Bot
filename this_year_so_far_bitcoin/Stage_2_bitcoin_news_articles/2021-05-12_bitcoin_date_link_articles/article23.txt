The news: Money wiring service giant MoneyGram inked a deal with Coinme to let customers buy or sell bitcoin with cash at more than 12,000 brick-and-mortar locations across the U.S. “This is a major milestone for the bitcoin and cryptocurrency communities, and for the millions of people who will benefit from a trusted, easy and affordable onramp to digital currency,” said Coinme CEO Neil Bergquist, who co-founded the Seattle startup in 2014 and has helped build out a cryptocurrency exchange network that includes ATMs and Coinstar kiosks. The MoneyGram deal is the latest example of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption over the past year as prices of bitcoin, ethereum, and other digital currencies have grown.
