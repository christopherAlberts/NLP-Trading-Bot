Bitcoin future volumes are reaching new all-time highs, trade in many OTC structures, and even payment networks like PayPal are enabling bitcoin buying and selling capabilities on their networks. It remains to be seen whether bitcoin’s 2020 record correlations persist into the future. However, we believe it is likely that its adoption will continue to develop.

2020 was truly a unique year on multiple fronts, and bitcoin was no exception as the price of bitcoin reached new all-time highs . Additionally, bitcoin’s calendar year correlations to traditional asset classes also hit record highs, yet the correlations remain low compared to those between the traditional assets—for example, the S&P 500’s 0.73 correlation with U.S. Real Estate as seen above.
