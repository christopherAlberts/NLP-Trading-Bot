Bitcoin has recovered after a week-long slump that saw its price fall below $30,000 for the first time since the start of this month.

The digital currency, which has soared to all-time highs of over $40,000 in January, rose to trade at around $32,325 on Friday.

The recovery will ease some fears about a long slide in the cryptocurrency's price after its blistering rise in recent weeks. This week, incoming US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has expressed scepticism over Bitcoin and fears have emerged over a "double spend" phenomenon that would display a flaw in the cryptocurrency's software.
