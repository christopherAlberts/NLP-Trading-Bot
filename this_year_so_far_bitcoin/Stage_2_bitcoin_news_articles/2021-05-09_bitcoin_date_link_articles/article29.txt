Bitfarms, a publicly traded bitcoin mining firm, announced on May 7 that it had won approval to list on the Nasdaq Global Market.

The timing of the listing is unclear at this time, though the firm said that it was moving "expeditiously" to "confirm Bitfarmsâ€™ common shares are eligible for electronic clearing and settlement through the Depository Trust Company (DTC)."

"As we learn more about the timing for the approval, we intend to provide a further update to the market. When approval has been obtained, we will announce the first date 'BITF' will begin trading on Nasdaq," Bitfarms said in a statement.

Bitfarms said that it would also utilize the BITF ticker for its Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) listing as well.

The development comes as publicly traded bitcoin mining firms have gathered attention in recent months. As previously reported, bitcoin miners hauled in $1.7 billion in revenue last month.
