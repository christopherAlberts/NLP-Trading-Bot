On May 7, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen shared his thoughts on Cardano ($ETH).

Cowen made his comments about Cardano during an interview with Austin Arnold and Aaron Arnold, the co-founders and hosts of the “Altcoin Daily” YouTube channel.

Here are a few highlights from his reamrks about Cardano:

“If an altcoin can’t outperform Bitcoin, then there’s no point in holding it. Can ADA outperform it… ADA outperforms Bitcoin in a bull market.“

“Going back to ADA, I see this as still a long-term play. Now, buying ADA at $1.37 is much riskier than buying it at $0.02… but in the grand scheme of the cycle, I do think ADA has a ways to go. I don’t think 1.37 is the market cycle top by any means. Market cycle tops don’t look like this.“

“I think in the grand scheme of the market cycle, I think it’s going to go much higher than where it currently is. If I had to throw a ballpark number out there, I would say somewhere between like $5 to $10 is my guess… If I’m wrong because it goes higher than $10, that’s something I don’t mind being wrong about.“

According to data by CryptoCompare, Cardano’s $ADA token is currently trading around $1.80, up 3.87% in the past 24-hour period.
