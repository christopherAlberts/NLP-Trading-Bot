Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of “The Black Swan," says he has been getting rid of his Bitcoin.

A currency is never supposed to be more volatile than what you buy and sell with it, the former options trader said, adding that you can’t price goods in the cryptocurrency. “In that respect, it’s a failure (at least for now)."

In that respect, it's a failure (at least for now). It was taken over by Covid denying sociopaths w/the sophistication of amoebas — Nassim Nicholas Taleb (@nntaleb) February 12, 2021

Taleb also said in a separate tweet Bitcoin has failed as a hedge against central bank policies.
