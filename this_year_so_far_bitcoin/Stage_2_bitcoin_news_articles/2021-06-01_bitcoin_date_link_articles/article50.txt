Earlier on May 31, giving a huge relief to cryptocurrency traders and investors in India, the Reserve Bank of India on Monday said that bank and other financial institutions can no longer cite 2018 RBI order that barred them from engaging in business exchanges. The RBI said Supreme Court had already set aside its order and hence the banks can not cite old circular and deny services to people trading/dealing in cryptocurrencies. " Such references to the above circular by banks/ regulated entities are not in order as this circular was set aside by the Honâ€™ble Supreme Court on March 04, 2020," said the RBI.

Note these coins have been picked either on their rankings or as per their popularity among crypto traders.
