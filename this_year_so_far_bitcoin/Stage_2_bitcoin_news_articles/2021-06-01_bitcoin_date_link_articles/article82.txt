Cryptocurrency is the talk of the finance world, and the credit card industry wants to be part of the conversation by offering rewards in digital currencies, such as bitcoin, BTCUSD, +0.73% ethereum, ETHUSD, +1.93% Cardano, ADAUSD, +2.34% Dogecoin DOGEUSD, +1.04% and others.

The question is, should you mix credit card rewards with the crypto market? For the most flexibility, probably not. Instead, separate credit card rewards and cryptocurrency purchases.
