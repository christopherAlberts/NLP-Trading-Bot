Most people’s to-do list for getting married doesn’t involve investing in Bitcoin.

But for one 29-year-old ready to express his love for his partner, buying the cryptocurrency was one of the first things that came to mind.

“I have about 50k cash now and hope to collect another 50k between now and when we actually marry,” he posted on Reddit.

“I plan to convert this into crypto but wanted to check if this is a safe option in the event of a divorce. Would the court be able to locate these assets?”

“I don’t intend to divorce at any point, but life happens. My parents were in love for 20 years and that s--- still went downhill when I was a teen.”

His thinking is far from romantic, but ask any divorce lawyer what they make of his dilemma and they will argue that he is on to something.

Ayesha Vardag, nicknamed Britain’s “Diva of Divorce”, says she has seen a five-fold increase in divorce inquiries mentioning cryptocurrency since 2017.
