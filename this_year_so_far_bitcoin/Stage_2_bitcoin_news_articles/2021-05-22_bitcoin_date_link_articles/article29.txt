A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to a mid-morning intraday low $35,372.0 before making a move.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $33,196, Bitcoin rose to a late morning intraday high $38,956.0.

Falling well short of the 38.2% FIB of $41,592 and the first major support level at $41,942, Bitcoin fell back to $37,200 levels and into the red.

Late in the day, Bitcoin moved back through to $38,000 levels before ending the day at sub-$38,000 levels.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact in spite of the latest slide back to sub-$30,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need a sustained fall through the 62% FIB of $27,237 to form a near-term bearish trend.
