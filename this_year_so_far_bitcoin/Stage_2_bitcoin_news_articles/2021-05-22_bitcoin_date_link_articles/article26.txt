I’d just moved into a new rental (my second move in five months), my bank account was looking bleak and I was firmly of the view the world was against me.

As you do in 2021, I decided to live slightly beyond my means by suffering some short-term financial strain in the hope of some long- or short-term gain.

Wow such meme: doge overtook the internet in 2013.

At the time, I remember discussion among my friends (I’m 30) was heavily weighted around the pandemic, what, if any, positives might come from it and how to get rich (quick). Cryptocurrencies were racing to all-time highs and dogecoin - which started as a joke variant of bitcoin but has become actually valuable in its own right - was looking like it might deliver hockey stick growth.

On January 28, a single dogecoin went from 1 to 11 cents, and on February 9 I bit the bullet and bought $50 worth (458.59 dogecoins).
