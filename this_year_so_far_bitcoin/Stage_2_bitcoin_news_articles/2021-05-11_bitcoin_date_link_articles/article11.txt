Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg dropped a pretty big personal tidbit on Tuesday via the social platform: He has a goat named Bitcoin. His other goat, who was also featured, is named Max. Of course, with the Internet being the Internet, the rumor mill has been working overtime to figure out what, if anything, these goat names might mean.One popular theory is that Zuckerberg was using the names of his goats to reveal that he is a bitcoin maximalist. Another suggestion was that he will be announcing bitcoin holdings at Facebook’s Annual Shareholder meeting on May 26, and this goat post was a hint. Zuckerberg has yet to offer any explanation, so the Internet will likely continue coming up with its own theories.There is one thing the Internet can agree on, however, and that is the hope that Bitcoin and Max don’t end up as dinner. Remember that time he went a whole year where he only ate animals that he had killed himself ? Hopefully that’s not the future for these two adorable goats.
