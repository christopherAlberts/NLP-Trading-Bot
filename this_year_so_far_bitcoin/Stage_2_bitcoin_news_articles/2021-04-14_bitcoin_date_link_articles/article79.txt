The investor said he began investing in September 2020 with a company and talked with its representatives on the phone and online, police said.

When the investor tried to make a withdrawal, he was told he would have to pay a deposit before receiving his money, police said. The investor began to receive threats by email demanding his personal information before he could get his money back.

“It is suspected the entire transaction with this company has been fraudulent since the beginning and the complainant is out an estimated $348,000,” Stratford police said.

Police said investors should avoid investing with unknown companies online, specifically those that deal in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies because the transactions are difficult to trace.

Investors should also research companies to ensure they’re legitimate before making investments or providing personal information, police said.
