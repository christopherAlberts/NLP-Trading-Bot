The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), hit all-time highs on Tuesday, but that doesn't mean they were the largest gainers in a 24-hour period leading up to press time. Some notable coins in green on Wednesday were Bitcoin Cash (BCH), XRP (XRP), VeChain (VEY), THORChain (RUNE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Tron (TRX).

BCH: The coin that emerged after a 2017 hard fork of Bitcoin BTC has risen 138.2% since the year began. BCH traded 22.24% higher at $823.92 at press time. This month, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service clarified that the receipt of BCH after the hard work constitutes taxable gross income, reported Cryptonews.com — citing a memorandum by the agency.

XRP: The token associated with Ripple has gained 778.63% since the beginning of 2021. XRP traded 33.95% higher at $1.94 and has spiked 85.22% on a weekly basis. XRP is buoyed by Ripple’s multiple legal victories related to a lawsuit with the United States Securities and Exchange Bureau and its band of supporters.

VEY: The token associated with the blockchain-powered supply chain platform rose 762.62% since the beginning of 2021. VEY traded 16.92% higher at $0.16 at press time.
