Bitcoin is having a moment in Washington and on Wall Street.

The cryptocurrency hit all-time highs last week along with other financial markets, even as violence erupted from a pro-Trump mob at the U.S. Capitol. More quietly, cryptocurrency is gaining traction and legitimacy in regulatory circles in Washington, particularly at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, where acting Comptroller Brian Brooks, who is the former chief legal officer at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc., has made cryptocurrency policy a hallmark of his tenure.

For many regulators, one of the primary promises of fintech is its potential to spur investment activity among underrepresented communities in the financial system, as things like cryptocurrency can be cheaper and present fewer obstacles than more established investment paths. Brooks isn’t the only regulator to have stressed the potential of fintech to increase financial inclusion: It’s also been a major talking point of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chair Jelena McWilliams, although other policymakers, including some Democratic lawmakers, have challenged the idea.
