New York (CNN Business) The fried chicken sandwich wars sparked by Popeyes in 2019 are still clucking along two years later -- and they're heating up again.

This week, KFC, McDonald's, Shake Shack and even salad-chain Sweetgreen kicked off the new year with their own takes on the crispy concoction. Cheap, tasty and growing in sales, fried chicken sandwiches are becoming an attractive menu item for many fast food restaurants.

Americans have been eating more chicken and less beef the last few years, a trend the fast-food industry has seized on recently, according to Peter Saleh, managing director and analyst covering restaurants and food distribution at analysis firm BTIG.

"This has been an ongoing battle," Saleh recently told CNN Business. "The chicken poultry segment is a little bit more popular these days with consumers. Everybody's trying to capitalize on that."

Saleh explained that the sudden surge in new sandwiches -- and the marketing of them -- is a result of the pandemic, which forced companies to pull back on ads during the spring of 2020 when the virus first started spreading in the United States.
