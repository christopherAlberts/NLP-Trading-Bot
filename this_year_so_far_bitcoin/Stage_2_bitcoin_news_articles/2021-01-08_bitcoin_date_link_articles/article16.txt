Of course, the crypto community has been excited about the bullish prices and many have been saying we still have a ways to go price-wise. Morgan Creek cofounder, Anthony Pompliano, discussed the subject on CNBC‚Äôs Fast Money broadcast yesterday and said bitcoin would be far superior to gold someday. Pompliano told CNBC‚Äôs Melissa Lee that ‚ÄúBitcoin is a 10x improvement on gold‚Äù and ‚Äúwe will one day see a $1M Bitcoin price, which is only 2x the gold market cap.‚Äù Bitcoin‚Äôs $778B market cap is now half the size of silver‚Äôs market cap of roughly 1,700,000 metric tons of .999 Ag.

In a response to Pompliano‚Äôs guest appearance on Fast Money, Microstrategy‚Äôs Michael Saylor said: ‚ÄúGradually, then suddenly, investors are coming to the horrifying realization that Gold is a zombie store of value.‚Äù Similarly, the bitcoin bull, Chamath Palihapitiya, also spoke on CNBC and told the broadcasters that BTC will be going to $200k someday. Palihapitiya spoke about the mistrust in governments and central banks worldwide and said first it will be $100k and then $200k at some point down the road.

The analyst Willy Woo tweeted some opinions that he had as he believes we may never see the $20k price zone again. ‚ÄúUpdate,‚Äù Woo tweeted. Never going to see $20k again, $25k will take a black swan to pierce, rising $500 per day. $30k is formidable support. 30% is the maximum projected pull back once BTC tops at current structure (changing fast),‚Äù he added.

Following the statements about BTC, an individual asked Woo his thoughts on ETH‚Äôs rally. ‚ÄúATH is a beautiful thing. Nothing like seeing an asset go into outer space with free flowing price discovery. ETH is about to do that,‚Äù Woo responded.
