bitcoin ammunition for democracyby james lee 李牮斯a meeting between us and chinese officials in anchorage alaska last month showed that the uschina struggle will no doubt continue during the administration of us president joe bidenthe struggle between democracies and authoritarian regimes is likely to last decades because it stems from the fundamental difference in the two value systems — a difference that the chinese communist party ccp sees as an existential threat the ccp fears that chinese might someday demand the protection of individual liberties and has therefore waged a yearslong “total war” to undermine democracies which eventually prompted the us to fight backwithin the various battlefronts of the ccp’s total war against democracies the currency war could be the most critical to the establishment of the next global orderthe ccp systematically aims to disrupt the us’ source of power that is the us dollar — the reserve currency of the world that has allowed the us to enjoy “exorbitant privileges” a term coined by former french president valery giscard d’estaing in the no other country in the world could run trade and fiscal deficits as deep as the us’ without facing a total collapse of its own currency — so farto put it into perspective us mandatory spending plus military outlays took up  percent of tax receipts last year — this means the military might of the us is “borrowed” and only sustainable if the faith in the us dollar is maintainedthe us national debt is expected to reach  trillion by the end of this year and  percent of the us’ entire debt load in its history would have been added in the short span of the past  years alonethe us federal reserve is expected to finance the vast majority of the deficit spending as the us domestic banking system runs out of capacity to buy more us government debt and international buyers run out of appetitethe dollarbased financial system is quickly running into structural fragility as trillions of us dollars is printed out of thin air to fill fiscal gaps the ccp knows this achilles’ heel well and aims to exacerbate the painafter the us in  sanctioned iran by cutting off its access to the us dollar system the ccp embarked on a multidecade strategy to dedollarize itself and eventually the worldtwo things happened at the time one the ccp started hoarding gold in preparation for the gold standard and two it created a digital currency task force at the people’s bank of china which eventually led to china’s digital currency dcep — “digital currency electronic payment”this is a wellbalanced move by the ccp to topple the us dollar using tools from history and future technology through gold and digital currency respectivelyhow would the ccp weaponize gold soon after  the ccp stopped funding us deficits through us treasury purchases and channeled that purchasing power into physical gold and other hard assetsfrom  to  china cleverly used the depressed gold prices to import  to  tonnes of gold per month this purchase binge coupled with china being the largest gold producer in the world likely put the ccp’s gold hoard materially above that of the us of about  tonnesshould an allout currency war break out the chinese currency could adopt the gold standard and put the ccp’s gold holdings to geopolitical usethe country that switches to the gold standard first always gets the conversion price of gold to the local currency — the local currency becomes the “unit of account” of the anchoring asset or gold in this caseit is likely the ccp will set the price significantly higher in renminbi terms during a currency war this would trigger the flow of physical gold from democratic countries to the ccp and a further depletion of gold inventory in the old financial centers by the force of the free marketa vicious cycle of selling us dollars to buy gold in london and new york and shipping it to china for renminbi could destabilize the greenback and lead to the ultimate loss of faith in it as a reserve currencythis chain reaction could be set off by the renminbi as opposed to the us dollar becoming the unit of account for goldcontrary to conventional wisdom the prominence of the us dollar does not come from its “medium of exchange” function and certainly not “store of value” function considering the  percent loss of purchasing power since the  after the abandonment of the gold standardthe core of the greenback’s strength comes from the “unit of account” function of moneynot only energy is priced in us dollars through the petrodollar system but  percent of international trade involves the us dollar more than  percent of all foreign bank reserves are denominated in us dollars and nearly  percent of the world’s debt is priced in the greenback — all significantly outweighing the  percent share of the us in global gdpthis creates a perpetual demand for the greenback globally and an irreplaceable position in the human economic psycheevery move by the ccp on the us dollar has been laserfocused on disrupting its unit of account function this deliberate external bombardment coupled with internal weakness due to the loss of fiscal and monetary discipline of the us dollar spell grave prospects for the liberal orderif the currency war were to be lost against the ccp most other battlefronts would not matter — trade  biotechnology etcthat is until bitcoin came along to turn the tide of the battlebitcoin has grabbed the attention of the investment world as the quickest asset in history to reach  trillion market capitalization with the highest volatilityadjusted returns meaning low volatility considering the returnsbitcoin has in the past few months also captured the imagination of corporations as tesla and other insightful companies started to adopt it as a treasury asset that would profoundly redefine competitive advantages in their core businesseshowever to the fault of all these headline grabbing developments the world might be overlooking the national security implications of this unhackable infinitely scarce network that has emerged for the first time in human historywhile central banks around the world scramble to create central bank digital currencies in which the ccp has at least a fiveyear technological lead — essentially a lost cause and a waste of resources for democracies — bitcoin has quietly secured a pivotal win for the us dollar and the liberal order in the currency war against the ccpbitcoin is almost always quoted in us dollar terms more than  percent of fiatcurrency trading in bitcoin is in the greenback and more than  percent of bitcoin transactions in china are facilitated through us dollarlinked stablecoinsthe dominance of the us dollar as the “unit of account” of bitcoin would only strengthen after the us office of the comptroller of the currency in january approved banks to use us dollar stablecoinsbitcoin and the us dollar are two sides of the same coin the us dollar provides the unit of account function for bitcoin and bitcoin transfers its geopolitically important antifragile trait to the us dollar the bitcoin network is indestructible and its idea is a threat to the ccp — the party in  tried to ban bitcoin and failedif bitcoin were to overtake gold’s size in four years — a mathematical certainty in this columnist’s view — the us dollar in turn would also have secured its position in the financial order of the future regardless of the ccp’s gambit in gold or dcepthe national security of the liberal order would be the biggest beneficiary of bitcoin’s riseto the advantage of democracies the ccp inherently can never fully understand or adopt bitcoin which has liberty and selfsovereignty built into its programming codes bitcoin is the antithesis to totalitarianismthe effects are already evident ccpfriendly corporations have largely lagged behind on the adoption of bitcoin as a treasury asset due to their false faith in a centralized authority as opposed to decentralized consensusbased network such as bitcoinchinese miners of bitcoin also have for years exchanged their pristine bitcoin for depreciating fiat currency at a great financial and national security loss to the ccpit is crucial for democratic nations to understand the national security implications of bitcoin especially for taiwan which is in a fight for its survival against the ccp’s encroachmentrecent factually incorrect comments by central bank governor yang chinlong 楊金龍 dismissing bitcoin are reminiscent of those in the ccp — which is a concerning developmentclouded by the “yes to blockchain no to bitcoin” myth and a lack of national security awareness several local governments that sponsored blockchain projects in taiwan also have a high risk of being assimilated by the ccp’s blockchain services networkif they are not careful taiwanese might be helping the ccp build a digital “one belt one road” which would have much greater threats than on the brighter side taiwan has one of the most friendly legal environments when it comes to developing the bitcoin ecosystem because of its legal classification as a “virtual asset” a much more accurate definition of the bitcoin network not a security and certainly not a currencycurrencies would always be the privilege of nations and bitcoin is the muchneeded aid to the currencies of democracies in the fight against ccp’s currency warjames lee is a former hedge fund chief investment officer
