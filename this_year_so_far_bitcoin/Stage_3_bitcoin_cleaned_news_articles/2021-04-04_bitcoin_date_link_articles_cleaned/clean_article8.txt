author editorial board anunext time you’re eating a pizza spare a thought for laszlo hanyecz back in  the florida resident bought two pizzas for about  the problem he used bitcoin to pay for them —  bitcoin to be exact had he saved those bitcoin instead of spending them on pizza they would be worth more than  million today it’s not all bad news laszlo goes down in history as the first person to use bitcoin in a commercial transaction his toddler enjoyed the pizza toothe multimilliondollar question now is what’s next for digital currencies the answer will be found in asiawhile things aren’t looking good for bitcoin particularly in india where it is set to be banned the story for digital currencies more generally is positive with big benefits for the economies that move firstfor the true believers bitcoin is the currency of the future with endless possibilities it will hobble corrupt governments empower the disenfranchised promote financial inclusion among the billions of ‘unbanked’ people help reduce global poverty and displace the us dollar by creating a new global currency and reserve assethave they been right so far not really the price of bitcoin has increased  times faster than its use in transactions over the past five years its extreme volatility and limited use in transactions not many people are buying pizza with it these days means it fails to satisfy even the most basic criteria of a currency — to serve as an accepted medium of exchangebitcoin’s longterm prospects in asia don’t look good either a fundamental lesson we were meant to have learned from the great depression was that the supply of a country’s currency should not be fixed when consumers become scared about the future — during a pandemic for example — they start hoarding money and stop spending because ‘my spending is your income and your spending is my income’ this triggers a dangerous deflationary spiral with a lack of demand leading to falling prices and cuts in investment ultimately leading to a depression of output and incomesthe role of central banks is to stop this downward spiral by increasing the supply of money to satisfy the desire to hoard cash and get people spending again bitcoin’s fixed supply — only  million will ever be created — makes it a dreadful candidate for a currencythe problem gets worse should policymakers adopt the same currency as other countries as would be the case if bitcoin were a global or regional currency they would lose the ability to adjust their exchange rate in the face of economic shocks when the greek economy was plunged into recession just over a decade ago its exchange rate couldn’t fall to support the greek recovery by making greek exports cheaper because its currency the euro was shared with other much bigger economies that weren’t in the same sort of crisis the result was a painfully long greek recoveryanother scenario is that bitcoin doesn’t replace any asian currencies but rather runs in parallel to them still this would raise financial stability concerns for many asian governments many asian economies primarily developing and emerging economies have suffered crises in the past from volatile international capital flows and have acted to regulate those flows to maintain stability if bitcoin as a parallel currency provides an opportunity to bypass these capital controls then it would quickly be banned as proposed in india economies with fixed exchange rates would also need to ban bitcoin since as in the  speculators could use bitcoin to sell the domestic currency eventually collapsing the fixed exchange rate systemthe likely outcome in asia is that the trend becomes the norm under this scenario cryptocurrencies operating beyond the control of government solidify themselves as a new kind of digital gold over time their prices stabilise and they are held as an asset in the same way investors hold gold to hedge against inflation and market volatility dreams of bitcoin solving the world’s monetary problems fade into the background as it becomes nothing more than yet another financial asset on the balance sheets of rich peopledoes that mean that digital currency more generally has no future despite the pitfalls of unregulated cryptocurrencies like bitcoin the future for digital currencies is positive and being shaped in asia by governments looking to get ahead in digital payments systems including the use of cryptocurrency technologyin our lead article this week gordon clarke and emir hrnjic show that digital currencies and payments are thriving in asia china is leading the world in central bank digital currency deployment along with cambodia while singapore has cautiously positioned itself to be a major player using a different approach in each case asian economies are on the cutting edge of innovation while avoiding the pitfalls of bitcoin by ensuring government sovereignty over currency not having a common currency with other economies and allowing for the supply of their currencies to be adjustablesince starting its digital currency project in  the people’s bank of china has moved rapidly towards launching the world’s first major sovereign digital currency – the digital yuan ‘this should be an easy sell to consumers used to  instant digital cash thus enabling the government to finetune domestic monetary policy by directly controlling the amount of noncash funds available to the economy’ say clarke and hrnjic ‘there are already realworld digital yuan operations in major cities including shenzhen chengdu and suzhou where customers obtain digital yuan via banks’the national bank of cambodia launched bakong in october  available to retail customers this peertopeer funds transfer service supports transactions in cambodian riel or us dollar selfproclaimed as ‘the first retail payments system run by a central bank using blockchain’ bakong has reportedly brought onboard almost a third of the cambodian population ‘the low barriers to entry significantly boosted financial inclusion which could result in a real difference to economic activity as observed in other parts of the world’ say clarke and hrnjicthailand has also been a leader in central bank digital currency with the focus on immediate interbank transfers between individuals and at pointofsale using qr codes mobile and account numbers clarke and hrnjic point out that the adoption of these technologies has been significant ‘around  per cent of thai bank account holders signed up to promptpay which is also widely used by small retailers who no longer have to handle cash or supply change’the benefits of digital currencies promise to be significant ranging from substantially increased financial inclusion improved productivity and increased investment consumption and growth from a lower cost of capital not all of asia is moving ‘the philippines — the first country in asia to embrace mobile payment with smart money in  — has not capitalised on its early lead’ warn clarke and hrnjic and ‘larger asean countries such as indonesia are not at the forefront’along with the benefits of digital currencies come substantial firstmover advantages as investors begin to favour asia’s frontier digital economies as this happens asia’s digital laggards will begin to feel the pressurenow is the time to start catchingup or be left in the monetary dark agesthe eaf editorial board is
