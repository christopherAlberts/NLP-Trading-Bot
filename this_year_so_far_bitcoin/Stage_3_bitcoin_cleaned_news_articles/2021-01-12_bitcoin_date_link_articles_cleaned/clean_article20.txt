one of the oil mining industrys big challenges is finding a profitable way to handle the associated gases released during the mining process the solution could lie in bitcoin miningoil extraction and bitcoin btc might seem like strange partners but btc might hold the key to tackling one of the oil sectors big pollution problems oil extraction often produces associated gases as one of its byproductsit is often not financially viable or practical for oil companies to sell this gas so it is vented into the atmosphere causing pollution bitcoin could provide a way to incentivise companies to process it onsite helping to significantly reduce scope  emissionsit is not always viable to process associated gasesassociated gases are a common byproduct of oil production sites ithe primary gas is methane  and although it can be processed into liquid natural gas lng it often isn’t viable on many sites around  to  billion cubic metres of natural gases are flared or vented every year this is about  billion worth of lngto make matters worse the issue of flaring has become a selfinflicted pr headache for the oil and gas sector in the usa the trump administrations decision to revoke rules surrounding methane gas leakage has shined a light on the sector and led to the french government blocking a  billion deal between engie and nextdecade with texas potentially leaking three times more methane than previously thought this challenge is only going to become largerdespite the fact that associated gases represent such a big financial and pr burden oil extraction sites seem reluctant to do anything about it this is largely because of two problems lack of infrastructure and the price of lngmany sites lack the infrastructure to process natural gasof the two problems oil producers have the most control over infrastructure although it is true that many sites lack a direct connection to gas pipelines and other essential infrastructures there are solutions for example in  an mit team was working on “low cost and low maintenance” methods to convert gas to liquid processing solutions these would make it possible for production sites to process gas rather than vent or flare ita more recent solution is the cryobox the solution can produce as much as  metric tons of lng per day and can be easily moved between sites this output is decidedly smallscale but it could provide a simple solution for oil producers looking to decrease their reliance on flaring or venting gasin some cases this infrastructure may not be enough and remote sites may still be forced to pick between flaring and venting although both are environmentally damaging flaring is around  times less so however it still remains an economic loss for producers to simply burn natural gas and it is significantly better to process it into lng the problem is that sometimes even where the infrastructure exists the price of lng makes it unviabledemand for lng is rising but prices remain unpredictablealthough natural gas production is continuing to increase the market is already somewhat oversupplied this combined with the prevailing economic climate has led to natural gas prices trending negative this means that even sites with the correct infrastructure might not be financially attractive or even viable for those sites to process associated gases into lngthis is where cryptocurrency and bitcoin could provide a solution although lng prices have plummeted bitcoin prices have recently cracked the  barrier with little sign of slowing industry experts are also seeing institutional as well as individual investors committed to the crypto marketbitcoin is dependent upon a process known as “mining” this involves networks of computers solving complicated equations to process transactions in exchange for their computing power these miners are given bitcoin this process is energyintensive which has caused much mining to move to china but luckily for oil producers there is a source of untapped energy literally being burnedcompanies such as denverbased crusoe energy systems are already deploying mobile bitcoin mining solutions the company has deployed around  data centres in oil fields in the usa as part of its digital flare mitigation programme the company also recently signed an agreement with kraken oil  gas to deploy  morethe system uses epacertified emission control technology and catalytic converters to reduce flare and vent related emissions by up to  at the same time it allows oil producers to convert their associated gas productions into a highly profitable asset which could have significantly higher long term payouts than lng processing alonecreative solutions incentivise good behaviouralthough environmentalists are wellmeaning when they ask for better controls they often overlook the reality on the ground if oil companies can’t make climate change mitigation profitable or at least affordable their operations will simply go bankrupt this could have significant economic consequences in the long term and could also lead to abandoned sitesinstead a focus on creative solutions to economically incentivise cleaner production processes will help us build towards a sustainable future for both the oil sector and our planet
