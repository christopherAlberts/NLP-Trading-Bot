london reuters breakingviews  three years ago this column suggested that bitcoin whose price soared  during  faced a total wipeout the cryptocurrency wasn’t money but instead resembled the gold prospector’s fabled sardine tin “good for trading but not for eating” it was a timely call over the following months bitcoin shed more than twothirds of its value but now the crypto is back from the dead and trading at around twice its peak was my earlier bitcoin judgement wronga representation of virtual currency bitcoin is seen in front of a stock graph in this illustration taken january  most seasoned bubblewatchers would say no bitcoin is particularly susceptible to speculative fervour because its supply is pretty much fixed in the short run while demand is volatile certainly its nearvertical ascent into the beginning of  resembles a classic bubble the fact that the grayscale bitcoin trust a retail investment vehicle has traded recently at a  premium to net asset value is another reliable indicator of irrational exuberance google trends shows a soaring interest in bitcoin on a par with the  spikenor should it be overlooked that the latest bitcoin frenzy has taken place against the backdrop of one of history’s great investment manias last year tesla’s share price went up by more than twice bitcoin’s surge with the federal reserve printing more money at a faster pace than ever and interest rates stuck at zero monetary policy is guaranteed to stoke bubbles under these conditions financial assets which generate no income like bitcoin tend to do bestlarge investment managers have caught the crypto bug the arrival of institutional investors calls to mind the late stages of the dotcom mania at the end of the  century having put together a large cryptoassets division fidelity investments is encouraging its high net worth clients to plunge corporate treasuries are said to be looking into bitcoin hedge funds have sought to get ahead of wall street’s big move into cryptocurrencies multimilliondollar orders placed in an illiquid market have ramped bitcoin’s priceparadoxically the very forces behind the current bubble may turn out to be the crypto’s salvation take monetary policy bitcoin was created in the wake of the lehman brothers bust to offer an alternative to fiat currencies whose stability appeared threatened by central bank moneyprinting yet fears of runaway inflation turned out to be premature last year however the central banks created a great deal more money than during the financial crisis rather than remaining trapped in the financial sector as was the case with earlier quantitative easing the new money has financed spending by governments and seeped into the broad economyhaving tasted the forbidden fruit of the magic money tree there’s no going back central bankfinanced government deficits are here to stay if inflation returns in the near future as seems likely investors will look for alternative stores of value to fiat currencies gold which has been around for many millennia is an obvious contender but a digital age demands digital gold and bitcoin is in a prime position to fulfil that rolein fact bitcoin has much in common with gold not only as its supply is limited but since the crypto produces no income it is impossible to value value is in the eye of the beholder bitcoin’s failure to date to serve as money is not a great drawback as investment strategist dylan grice of calderwood capital research points out gold retained its value even after it was demonetisedhaving survived several bubbles and busts over the past decade bitcoin has shown itself to be remarkably durable bubbles are great marketing tools just about everyone on earth now knows about the bitcoin brand in a world where network effects are allpowerful this free publicity gives the bestknown crypto a huge advantage over rivalsinstitutional investors may be ramping bitcoin but the arrival of the suits is making cryptos respectable in its early years bitcoin exchanges were notoriously unreliable with massive thefts occurring at mt gox and other dubious outfits today cryptos can be stored safely at reputable operations such as coinbase bitcoin ownership is also coming under the regulatory umbrella as digital exchanges jockey to meet the “know your customer” requirementstransactions in bitcoin have always been notoriously inefficient but financial technology companies have come to the rescue for a small fee bitcoin held in fintech accounts can be converted into dollars for transaction purposes and turned back into cryptos on receipt true this goes against the grain of the “distributed ledger” and looks much like traditional banking but what the heck it seems to work you will soon be able to pay for a morning starbucks with a crypto more importantly it’s possible to envisage bitcoin serving as the monetary base for a digital payments system performing a similar role to gold prior to since the lehman bust savers have become accustomed to negative real interest rates the massive costs incurred by the pandemic ensure that financial repression will continue for years zero interest rates are possible because central banks can issue fiat money in limitless quantities the dollar has become a zerointerest perpetual bond which by definition has no value curiously things look more normal in the world of socalled “decentralised finance” where digital tokens can be borrowed and lent over the ethereum network at reasonable rates of interestseveral years ago claudio borio of the bank for international settlements warned that unconventional monetary policies threatened an “epochdefining seismic rupture” borio envisaged a breakdown of globalisation accompanied by rising inflation and capital controls in recent years bitcoin has proved its value in countries like argentina where currency regulations have been tightened and inflation remains endemic as grice points out people who can’t see bitcoin’s uses haven’t personally felt any need for its benefits if borio’s nightmare is realised that day may not be far awayon reflection i’d say my  bitcoin “bubble” call was spot on but i underestimated the crypto’s longer durability today the ersatz currency is in another bubble but it will survive the inevitable bust if we have learned anything from its brief history it’s that that which doesn’t kill bitcoin only seems to make it stronger
