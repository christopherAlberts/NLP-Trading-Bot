casinobonuses and promotionseasily the best site for bonuses and promotions is bitstarz their welcome bonus is the best we have seen offering a  match of your bitcoin up to  btc for your first depositscoming in second and third for promotions ignition casino and bovada both have nice welcome bonuses with ignition having an unlimited  bitcoin match bonus for every deposit and bovada having bitcoin bonuses on your first three deposits both sites offer more deposit bonuses after your first one but neither of these bitcoin casinos can match the offers that fortunejack hasdepositing and withdrawal optionsall of the sites use the same type of depositwithdrawal system where you have to verify your account before you can withdraw however there are some sites that have a fee when you withdraw from your account we hate these fees so below each site is outlined in what they charge and who has the worst fee for withdrawingthe best withdrawal system goes to  casino and ignition casino who stand above the rest as they have no fees when withdrawing from your account most gambling sites have a withdrawal fee and this is to keep their customers from withdrawing and instead keep gambling on their site so having no withdrawal fee is a huge plus as there is no penalty for wanting to take out your winningsthe rest of the sites have a few stipulations for withdrawing from them for example fortunejack has a minimum withdrawal of  and bovada has a small withdrawal fee usually around  usdbut the worst withdrawal system has to be cafecasino they charge an ungodly amount to take out your bitcoin from their site cafe casino has a  withdrawal fee this is clearly there to keep the gambler from taking their money out of the site and they also charge a percentage fee if you have less than  dollars in your account by far the worst withdrawal system of all the bitcoin casinosrange of casino gamescafe casino and  casino are the best for the range of casino games  has over  different to choose from and cafecasino has the best option for jackpot multipliers with some of their slot games having a  multiplieruser interfaceignition casino and bovada are the top two choices for the user interface they dont do anything flashy with huge sliding pictures or big red text to catch your eye the simplicity of the gambling site with the speed that both websites load at is hard to match although  casino and fortunejack might look better their site performance takes a hit with all of the flashy stuff they addedadditional featuresbovada has the best additional features as it is the only site of the  to offer real sports gambling all of the other bitcoin casinos offered virtual sports and virtual gambling whereas bovada allows you to bet bitcoin on  different leaguesconclusionin conclusion red dog casino is the best bitcoin casino out of the ones we tested for a few reasons first their user interface is the best as it lays out all the games for you right away when you load in there isnt anything flashy on the screen trying to get you to play a certain game or asking you to refer a friend their site also loads the fastest out of all of them so when you click on different tabs or games you arent stuck waiting for  seconds for it to load simplicity is keytheir choice of games is great and the live table section has a nice feature that other gambling sites dont finally they have nice promotions to go along with the site they might not be able to match bitstarz and their promotions  but lets be honest who can they have  promotions in total from their first deposit bonuses tell a friend bonus and more they can at least give bitstarz a run for their money in this sectionoverall red dog was the best when looking at userfriendliness promotions
