despite a tumultuous  the stock market ended the year substantially higher the benchmark sp  finished up by  which is nearly double the indexs average annual return over the past  years but this gain pales in comparison to what bitcoin has been able to deliver for its investorslast year the worlds largest cryptocurrency by market cap more than quadrupled meanwhile over the trailing fiveyear period its gained better than  investors would struggle to find a public company with more robust returns over the past halfdecadethere are smart ways to play the bitcoin crazeinvestors love for bitcoin has also spilled over into equities there are more than a dozen publicly traded stocks that are in some way affiliated with bitcoin  and some of these businesses look downright intriguingfor example payments platform square nysesq has received a healthy revenue boost thanks to bitcoin exchange and investment via cash app this peertopeer payment platform has seen its monthly active user count more than quadruple since the end of  and its proven especially popular with millennials and generation z square has placed about  of its total assets  million at the time into bitcoin tokenstech stock nvidia nasdaqnvda has also been a clear winner from bitcoin euphoria among its many products nvidia sells graphics processing units used by cryptocurrency miners these miners use highpowered computers to solve complex mathematical equations that validate the accuracy of transactions on bitcoins blockchain networkthe most dangerous bitcoin stocksbut there are also more than a handful of bitcoin stocks that look downright dangerous investors would be wise to avoid these cryptocurrency stocks like the plaguegrayscale bitcoin trustthe fact is that not everyone who wants to buy bitcoin feels comfortable doing so from a cryptocurrency exchange further the securities and exchange commission hasnt given the green light for the creation of bitcoin exchangetraded funds thus one of the few ways to gain bitcoin exposure without directly buying bitcoin is with the grayscale bitcoin trust otcgbtcin easytounderstand terms the grayscale bitcoin trust purchases and holds bitcoin tokens it updates its token count pretty regularly making it easy for current and prospective investors to calculate an accurate net asset value nav for whats on the books so to speak unfortunately the grayscale bitcoin trust has two key drawbacksfirst of all it typically trades at a substantial premium to its nav as of jan  it held  bitcoin tokens based on a valuation of  per bitcoin this is a nav of  billion however the grayscale bitcoin trust closed on jan  with a value of  billion believe it or not this is actually one of the smallest premiums ive seen in the years ive followed this bitcoin basketholding security its not uncommon for it to be valued between  and  above its nav which is highly dangerous for unsuspecting investorsthe second issue is that the grayscale bitcoin trust charges a ridiculously high  management fee for doing close to nothing its management team acquires bitcoin tokens from time to time and coldstores them with coinbase how that necessitates to a  fee is beyond meriot blockchainwhile having a stake in the companies that sell bitcoin mining equipment is a potentially smart way to play the bitcoin craze owning stocks that actually do bitcoin mining is not thats why smallcap highflier riot blockchain nasdaqriot is such a dangerous investmentone of the prime concerns with mining companies is that theyre almost entirely reliant on the performance of bitcoin rather than on innovation since bitcoin miners receive block rewards of  tokens worth about  for validating transactions they need a continually euphoric bitcoin market to make this highly capitalintensive operating model worthwhile it also doesnt help that halving events every few years reduce the amount of reward paid out per block its a highly competitive and decreasing return game that produces few winnershow has riot blockchain done you ask although its stock has catapulted higher by more than  the company has only managed  million in revenue through the first nine months of  its also lost  million through the first nine months of backtoback years  and  thats a  billion valuation for a company that may not even reach  million in annual sales and doesnt look to be anywhere near recurring profitabilitylong story short riot blockchain is an awful bitcoin stock to buymicrostrategyanother badnews bitcoin stock thats been caught in the euphoria is enterprise analytics company microstrategy nasdaqmstrthe reason microstrategy has created so much buzz is because its piled all of its unneeded balance sheet cash into bitcoin in fact the company issued  million in debt just so it could acquire additional bitcoin this greater than  billion investment yielded  tokens at an average price of  sort of like grayscale buying microstrategy gives investors a way to ride bitcoins ebbs and flows without actually having to buy the tokenwhat makes microstrategy such a dangerous investment is threefold first bitcoin is itself a highly volatile and dangerous investment as ive previously argued it lacks true scarcity has minimal utility and could be easily replaced it also has a penchant for entering long bear markets after parabolic moves higher it doesnt seem like a prudent asset for a public company to store their cashsecondly microstrategy borrowed money to buy bitcoin which is twice as egregious as simply putting its existing cash in a highly volatile asset though this strategy has paid off momentarily its far from certain that thisll be a wise movethird microstrategys actual business operations arent that exciting its sales through threequarters of  are down  and its operating loss widened by  million from the prioryear ninemonth period to  million rather than focusing on the companys operations ceo michael saylor looks to be crossing his fingers and hoping for the best with an investment thats out of his controlbit digitalhave i mentioned that buying bitcoin mining stocks isnt a good idea if you happened to have skimmed past the section on riot blockchain heres a potentially even more dangerous mining stock bit digital nasdaqbtbtover the trailing year bit digital is the topperforming equity listed on the major us exchanges its gained just a hair over  even after being halved following its intraday high of  in early january youd think a company thats up  over the past year would have a compelling investment story but this just isnt the caselike riot blockchain the downside for a mining company like bit digital is that its almost entirely reliant on bitcoin tokens outperforming its pricey to buy and operate crypto mining equipment if bitcoin were to enter a sustained bear market which its done multiple times over the past decade bit digital could strugglewhat makes bit digital even scarier than riot is the fact that its a foreign issuer as noted in the companys response to fraud accusations two weeks ago he company as a foreign issuer is not required under home country practice to publicly announce its quarterly results i dont know about you but this is a gigantic red flag even though bit digital did share its three and ninemonth results theres no guarantee that its going to continue to do soplus for what its worth the company lost nearly  million over the first nine months of  and even with bitcoin soaring in the latest quarter managed a profit of only  thats not millions or thousands by the way thats   like the change in your wallet how this company is worth close to  million is mindboggling
