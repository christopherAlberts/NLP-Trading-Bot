few people have captured the imagination of the cryptocurrency market quite like microstrategy ceo michael saylor a guest on wednesday morning’s first mover on coindesk tvhis company’s purchases of bitcoin first announced in august validated a key narrative driving the current bull market the “institutions” were joining the fray companies fitting crypto’s definition of an institution can be far more modest in size and commercial rather than financial in mission than wall street’s it took a couple of months more of bitcoin prices languishing around the  level before really taking off in the final quarter of  but after that it hasn’t looked back well at least not yetlawrence lewitinn cfa is coindesk’s managing editor for global capital markets and a former fixedincome currencies and commodities trader who began his career on wall street nearly three decades ago this article first appeared in first mover coindesk’s daily markets newsletter subscribe hererelated colombias first commercial bank to pilot crypto servicesmicrostrategy’s series of bitcoin purchases have been a triumph as saylor noted in a recent tweet the company has thus far spent  billion to buy a total of  btc that puts its average cost at  at current prices microstrategy’s bitcoin was worth  billion as of march a  billion gain in value for an asset on the balance sheet of a company that had been worth around  billion for the prior three years is usually considered a good thingusuallyback of the envelopeyet it should be noted that while microstrategy bought bitcoin at  which now looks like a bargain it’s a different story for anyone buying mstr stock nowrelated all about bitcoin  mar  the company’s market cap is now about  billion as of march   billion of its assets were in bitcoin around the time it first announced its bitcoin buys microstrategy’s market cap was just  billion to buy all that bitcoin it now owns the company at first used some cash somewhere to the tune of around  million in recent months it has issued a total of  billion in convertible notes that if turned to equity could add a couple million shares to the nearly  million already outstanding that’s another discussionstory continuesdoing some paper napkin math – adding the value of the bitcoin and the underlying company while subtracting the debt and the cash spent to avoid doublecounting – the sum is  billion rounding that up to  billion and it’s still just half the current market capthe remaining  billion needed to get to a  billion valuation can be explained as … magic well at least to some investors buying the stock now otherwise that  billion premium is a bet on value that has yet to be unlocked it’s a bet that michael saylor and the rest of management is able to do incredible things with the company like buy a lot of bitcoin before everyone elseso far it’s been a profitable bet for those who were lucky to get in at the right time microstrategy shares have significantly outperformed bitcoin’s price since the start of septembertfw no etfindeed the argument made for buying microstrategy’s stock right now is that it’s one of the few ways for institutional investors otherwise barred from getting into bitcoin because of regulatory issues such as no bitcoin exchangetraded fund to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies however it’s a very very expensive way to do sothat’s because paying a  billion premium for microstrategy’s leveraged bitcoin hoard of  billion works out to roughly  per bitcoin more than triple the  the company paid to acquire it over the past few months remember buying microstrategy shares now isn’t the same as buying shares back in augustthus if anyone is buying microstrategy’s stock solely for the bitcoin play that person or “institution” would be paying nearly double for the bitcoin and getting a flatlining stockwill that premium still be there should a gary genslerled securities and exchange commission decide to approve a bitcoin etf who knows weirder things have happenedthe stock may well continue to rally in this environment anything can happen if shares in a declining video game retailer can skyrocket what’s to stop investors from wanting to pay double for bitcoinrelated stories
