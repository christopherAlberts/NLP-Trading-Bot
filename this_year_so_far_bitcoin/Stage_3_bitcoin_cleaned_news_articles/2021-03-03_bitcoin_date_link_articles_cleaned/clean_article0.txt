elon musk the chief executive of tesla recently announced his company had bought  billion almost  billion of bitcoin the announcement led to a flurry of enthusiasm and a quick surge in price for the controversial cryptocurrencythis price bump has been good news for musk in the short term at one point tesla’s bitcoin investment had gained more than  billion in value but can the enthusiasm be sustained i think there is a good chance that over the next year the price of bitcoin will drop towards its fundamental value which is nothingif bitcoin were to lose half its present value — which is not unlikely given its extremely volatile past behaviour — tesla will lose around  billion as elon musk owns about a fifth of tesla he would then be down  million in contrast i own no bitcoin so i will lose nothing which means i will have done  million better than muskwhy musk’s decision is a bad thingmusk is not doing tesla’s shareholders any favours if they wanted to be exposed to the rise and fall of bitcoin they could just buy some themselves now they have no choice if they want to invest in tesla electric vehicles they are also vulnerable to the vagaries of bitcointhe usual justification for making investments more diverse is that it can reduce risk but buying the extremely volatile bitcoin will make tesla’s earnings even more uncertainnor is musk doing his fans any favours as a “rock star ceo” with more than  million followers on twitter his musings are widely reported in other mediaby publicly endorsing bitcoin musk may lead some of his fans to invest in this highly risky speculative asset they may not be as well placed as a multibillionaire to absorb any losses on their investment to be fair musk has warned them not to invest their life savingsnor is he doing the inhabitants of this planet any favours the generation of bitcoins known as “mining” uses vast amounts of energy to power specialised computers solving complex but useless mathematical problemsepa  liu xingzheestimates vary as to how much energy they waste some studies suggest bitcoin production uses more electricity than the whole of argentina poland norway or switzerland but even the lower estimates are that it results in more carbon emissions than estonia and if bitcoin becomes more popular this will only increasewhat will the bitcoin price dohow likely is it that bitcoin could lose half its value within a year well it has form after it peaked at  in december  it dropped to  by february  after recovering to  in july  it dropped to  by march bitcoin may be the purest ever example of a speculative bubble it follows in the footsteps of famous bubbles such as the south sea bubble the dutch tulip mania gold around  the dotcom boom of  and the us housing market before the global financial crisis of read more  years since the south sea bubble the real story behind the iconic financial crashbut past bubbles have had more going for them houses provide shelter gold has industrial uses and jewellery can be made from it the south sea company and millennial tech stocks at least promised streams of future dividends even tulips can be admired for their beautybitcoin offers no return at all unless you can resell it to a “greater fool” it is a seinfeld asset — a speculation based on nothingthe limits of bitcoinbitcoin’s backers often say its value stems from the fact that supply is limited this is complicated by the fact dissident users have created “forks” in the past leading to schismatic bitcoins such as bitcoin cashbut even if we accept the limit at face value there is no limit on the creation of other cryptocurrencies there are literally thousands of them already such as litecoin tether and dogecoin in any case just because something is in limited supply that does not inherently make it valuableanother argument for bitcoin says it could be an alternative to traditional currency for making payments the first purchase made with bitcoin was more than a decade ago two pizzas paid for with  bitcoins i hope the buyer enjoyed the pizzas because the coins would now be worth  milliondespite the hype very few vendors accept bitcoin and hardly anyone pays with it a sydney art gallery that accepts bitcoin has never had anyone buy anything with it while a bar that accepts it reports no customers using it for years even some crypto conferences refuse to accept bitcoin you can buy an “i accept bitcoin” tshirt on amazon but you cannot pay for it using bitcoinamazonthis is unlikely to change materially tesla has hinted it may accept bitcoin in future but so far does notthere are inherent limits to the ability of bitcoin to provide payment services the bitcoin network can only handle  transactions per second compared with the  per second allowed by australia’s fast settlement service transactions may be stuck in a queue for hours if any electronic currency becomes a significant payment medium it is likely to be a central bank digital currency which would be legal tender and able to be used for very large numbers of transactionsmusk has plans to colonise mars so maybe he will declare bitcoin the legal tender there but until then it would be better for all of us if he kept it off tesla’s balance sheet
