you’ve probably got a friend relative or coworker who’s been talking about “bitcoin” or “dogecoin” for the past few months and you’re probably wondering either what those words mean or why they’re such a big dealyour friend or relative might have also encouraged you to invest in bitcoin or dogecoin so what exactly are these things and is it a good idea to invest in themboth answers are somewhat complicated but the best advice might be “proceed with caution”“bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies like ether and dogecoin are digital currencies and bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency” says neil grayson grayson is head of the financial institutions corporate and regulatory practice group for nelson mullins riley  scarborough south carolina’s largest law firm one of his areas of practice is digital currencies“they are potential replacements for the us dollar and other fiat currencies or a governmentissued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity as well as for gold” grayson continuesit sounds promising until grayson goes a little further“neither bitcoin nor any other cryptocurrency is anywhere close to having a stable valuation yet so they are all still very speculative investments their current valuations are driven more by emotion rather than rational analysis” – neil grayson nelson mullins riley  scarborough“the fascinating thing about cryptocurrencies is that unless they succeed in becoming currencies trusted mediums of exchange they will have no value” he says “i mean none”and as for dogecoin grayson doesn’t mince words“there is merit behind bitcoin but i think dogecoin is a big joke” he says “in fact it was created as a joke and as best as i can tell the reason for its incredible rise in valuation is solely due to social media hype and the end result will be no different than that of a traditional ponzi scheme the early investors will make a fortune — should they get out in time — and the later investors will collectively lose that same fortune”experts estimate there are at least  cryptocurrencies in existence today“if dogecoin were a company” he adds “and the individuals who are promoting dogecoin on social media were insiders of the company this would be a classic pumpanddump scheme and they would face significant civil and criminal liabilities”that might sound like a blackandwhite piece of advice to avoid investing in cryptocurrency entirely but grayson says that there’s some significant grey area despite the naysayers“as i am sure you have heard warren buffett once said that cryptocurrencies are probably rat poison squared” he says “and jamie dimon of jp morgan chase has said that cryptocurrencies are ‘a fraud worse than tulip bulbs’ obviously not everyone agrees with these opinions as the market value for all cryptocurrencies was somewhere around  trillion”grayson says the true litmus test for whether or not bitcoin or dogecoin will be profitable in the long term is yet to come“the challenge is in figuring what it will take for bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency to become an accepted medium of exchange” he says “the us dollar which is legal tender for all debts public and private is no longer backed by gold but is backed by the power of the us government it is an accepted currency because everyone agrees to take us dollars because they believe that everyone else will take us dollars it’s a selffulfilling equilibrium it is an open question whether bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency reaches this same level of trust and acceptance”ultimately though grayson seems pessimistic about the future of cryptocurrency“at this time i strongly believe that cryptocurrencies overall are in a bubble” he says “neither bitcoin nor any other cryptocurrency is anywhere close to having a stable valuation yet so they are all still very speculative investments their current valuations are driven more by emotion rather than rational analysis”
