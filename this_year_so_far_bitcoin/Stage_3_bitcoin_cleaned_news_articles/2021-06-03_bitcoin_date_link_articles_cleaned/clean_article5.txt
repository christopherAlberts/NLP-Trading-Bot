of course none of us have a crystal ball that can tell us what any asset will be worth in the future but when it comes to bitcoin cryptobtc it can be especially hard to predict in this fool live video clip recorded on may  foolcom contributor matt frankel cfp and industry focus host jason moser discuss where the leading cryptocurrency could be in a decade from nowjason moser lets fast forward  years are we there in  years where bitcoin can be seen by most as a reasonable store of value i would assume that the way things are going were probably going to continue to grow at least folks who see the merits of cryptocurrencies in whatever shape or form theres going to be i think continued adoption albeit probably somewhat slowly for the masses but at some point or another maybe we do get there its not to say we would never get therematt frankel there you go trying to bait me again i think its a mistake for anybody to think of it as a given that we are eventually going to get to mass adoption of cryptocurrencies thats still very up in the air at this point during some of our bitcoin data reviews one of our experts that i interviewed im not sure which one off the top of my head but one of them referred to whats going on right now as an inflection point where were either going to see bitcoin accelerate into mass adoption or not its not going to keep going at its current pace where youre going to have  to  adoption that subset of the population just believes in bitcoin forever youre either going to see it really start gaining traction or go the other way i really think its a very binary outcome i personally dont think its going to get there im very skeptical of the longterm use case of bitcoin when you hear about all these projects being done on the blockchain and things like that like mastercard and visa and all these other fintechs have their own blockchain divisions that are developing blockchain finance programs and things like that generally thats on the ethereum cryptoeth blockchain i could see that having more staying power than bitcoin but i really dont think youre going to see bitcoin become a mainstream currency i just dont i like the concept i like the technology ive mined bitcoin ive used bitcoin i lived off bitcoin for a day in las vegas just to see if i can do it so like i said i say this with peace and love i just dont see it getting theremoser yeah i tend to agree with you but by the same token as an investor one of the things ive just learned is you just always keep an open mind im going to keep an open mind to it it doesnt mean im interested in it i dont care about it i still dont see the use case for it i agree with what youre saying i also wouldnt be surprised at all if  years from now maybe we did see some change in the mentality or some some material used cases for it and other cryptos its going to be an interesting story to follow theres no question about itfrankel sure if you and i are wrong and it does gain mass adoption in  years bitcoin could be  millionmoser yes finite supply absolutely could befrankel my prediction is that in  years bitcoin will either be over  or under  nowhere in the middle im either going to be really right or really wrong say what you will over the past  years of bitcoins existence it hasnt done a lot of just puttering along its either gone up or down or straight up or straight down so if the past  years continues bitcoins  million in  years but interest can really evaporate quickly if it doesnt pan out so i think its going to be really high or really lowmoser yeah i think that interest is going to be key if something like  of the population right now has dabbled a toe in the crypto space were going to need to obviously have a lot more than that to create the ongoing interest otherwise youre right it will have a hard time
