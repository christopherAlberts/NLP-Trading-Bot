with me today mr bill mann good to see you my friendbill mann how are you chris thanks for having me onhill i am better for the sight of you were going to talk retail were going to talk space outer space specifically can we talk about bitcoin which we almost never do on this show but bitcoin fell  on wednesdaymann it did a thinghill i am not a currency investor but i dont recall the euro or the us dollar ever falling  in a single day i think we talked about coinbase on this show when it went public its down about  from its ipo i remember thinking at the time and maybe i even said at the time that coinbase seems like an easier way to invest in bitcoin if youre a selling client because its a platform take this in any direction you want but i am curious what went through your mind when you saw one little part of the financial world on fire yesterdaymann its a bigger part than that youre talking about hundreds of billions of dollars of notional value that were eliminated yesterday a lot of people have pointed to elon musk coming out and saying that tesla was no longer going to be accepting bitcoin for environmental reasons by the way heres my prejudices i side with elon musk on this but whatever its an asset thats out there giving him credit for that it would be the same way as remember that volkswagen commercial where the kid thinks hes using the force to start the carhill yesmann thats elon musk the person whos actually hitting the button is china china decided this last week they announced that they are no longer going to be allowing cryptocurrencies as the mode of exchange that is a big deal much bigger than elon musk doing the force thing there are huge questions about what bitcoin is whether it is a store value i suspect that its a store of value in the same way that art and baseball cards are a store value theres just not as much behind it as we think and it is definitely not a currency you cannot tell me that something that moves that much is a valid currency that is the zimbabwe dollar level of volatility thats not goodhill no thats definitely not good i was one of those people and i was not alone when musk came out and made the announcement bitcoin is not going to be accepted at tesla as payment for our vehicles because of the environment i just looked at that and i thought mann where were you two months agohill you knew that beforemann yeahhill didnt you know that before hes a smart guymann it is really hard and we know this chris to change your mind in publichill truemann its really hard to do you can see elon musk has had a pretty significant blow back from the bitcoin true believers people say they were going to show tesla some really weird stuff its hard to do but yes i do think that there was a little bit of rear guard figuring out things that i would have thought that someone who set out to do some big things including helping the environment would have researched before jumping on the bitcoin bandwagonhill lets move onto some earnings this is in earnings but well get to earnings shares of virgin galactic up  this morning after the space tourism company announced that its next space flight test is going to be on saturday virgin galactic is aiming to start commercial flights next yearmann yeahhill i have a couple of questions i guess my first is mann can i anticipate your next questionhill go for itmann next saturday like thathill yeah it seems like more prep would need to go into this and thatmann it seems more prep would be involvedhill is this an industry that interests you as an investormann i am a shareholder in virgin space or to make it fancy call it virgin space well go italian but it is a revenue less company this is by far the highest risk company in my portfolio because every bit of what you are betting on has yet to happen and may never happen in the way that they think its going to this isnt even competitive this is taking tourists to space among other aims that they wish to do yes every single event like this saying were going to test a rocket is big news for virgin galactic you have to keep in mind when youre talking about companies and theres a whole host of them companies that either dont really have operations dont have revenues or dont have earningsone of the adventures that youre signing up for as an investor is that youre going to feel whipsawed things like this are going to make the stock move a lot in the way that they will never do if youre a shareholder of a company like walmart whats walmart going to say thats going to cause the stock to move as much as virgin galactic has or does its part of the inventor obviously i think this is great news for them this is great news for us as shareholders you would hope theyd be putting things up into space at some point since thats what theyre supposed to be doing the fact that they are saying now that theyre doing it next week thats so interesting to me i know thats not a great radio hey this is interesting its a terrible word but nine days later theyre going to put a rocket up i thought that took monthshill yeah also the idea that hey were still testing the flights but were looking to be commercial next yearmann yeahhill look there is absolutely an opportunity for business in outer space i dont know what form it takes because part of me looks at virgin galactic and you can put bezos in there with blue origin and spacex all of these commercial flights to space part of me looks at them and says i am not interested in commercial flights on earth thats not historically a great profitable money churning machine for investors if im not going to invest in delta air lines tell me why i should be investing in virgin galacticmann what was it that warren buffett said as an investor he would have done the world of favor if someone had shot down the wright brothers planehill yesmann yes that is absolutely positively true well here is something else thats absolutely positively true about virgin galactic and anyone else who is trying to put something up into space its going to require a lot more capital they are going to be raising more money again its one of those adventures for me of all of the stocks in my portfolio this is the one that i have circled around it and have in red letters that flash could be a zero but i am so excited about what they are doing im willing to have a small amount of my portfolio in that speculation for me this is exciting chris i expected this to happen everything is a planhill absolutely before we get to actual retail

brands revenue was higher than expected same store sales at bath  body works was up  same store sales at victorias secret up  we were talking on the show earlier in the week about walmart and target and this is a nice reminder that its not just the general retailers that are doing well right nowmann people are buying some brashill some scented candlesmann some scented candles yeah a really good quarter for l brands i mean obviously when you look at what they did this year versus last year its almost not comparable because they are primarily malldriven i mean they do some business online but a lot of their stuff is fitted so they very much were impacted by the retail apocalypse of the first half of  i think some of whats happening here is people are now preparing to go back out into the world were beginning to see people who have put off these exact purchases youre not living at your home necessarily in sweatpants everyday anymore we here in the us are lucky enough to be able to start getting out and abouta lot of this trade i think is people who have put off delayed purchases theyre coming back to make them now it was a really good quarter for them but chris it also speaks in  of the most obvious statements whenever you hear an obvious statement in investing you have to assume that its priced in was that retail was dead that coronavirus was going to be the end of retail were not going to have enough time to talk about all of these but walmart turned in unbelievable earnings kohls turned in unbelievable earnings costco is crushing it l brands and as you said its a much more of a specialty retailer is crushing it these are all doing very well i dont think that in  if you were to say hey l brands is going to be up  in the first half of  that was something that many people would have boughthill i absolutely agree with that you can look at the stock being down   today look there are so many businesses that if you time the oneyear chart correctly to late march or sometime in april then yes the oneyear chart looks amazing but l brands chart looks amazing even if youre just going back six months so its had this tremendous runup ive said this a couple of times this week in reference to guidance that weve seen some companies come out and they put up good numbers but theyre not offering guidance so the stock gets ding i have said for a while now i think this is the quarter where people stopped getting the benefit of the doubt if theyre not offering guidance l brands is not offering guidance but to me its perfectly valid why they are not doing that its because theyre spinning off victorias secreti believe theyre aiming to do that by august so it makes perfect my expectation is that once that happens though the guidance will come back and it will be really interesting to see what bath  body works does on its own because this for a few years now for all the jokes that weve made about scented candles the story of this  business has been bath  body works is getting it done thats the business thats getting it done itll be interesting to see what it does as a standalone companymann chris you very much have been on top of this and it is easy no i am saying this straight up you actually have been on top of bath  body works doing much better as a brand and much better as a component of l brands than people really would think it feels like an old line retailer theyve done a really good job managing inventory theyve done a really good job with their stores and those investments that they made you could see it now is really paying offhill it has also changed my perception of what i should be paying for a candlemann lets get back to the candles because its importanthill i was just going to say a couple of months ago i went into a total wine and i was getting a couple of things and i saw this mediumsized candle and its wine scented i dont know what it was it was like cabernet whatevermann yesterdays beer scented hill stale beer you know what there are people who would buy a stale beer candle no but i picked it up i looked at it and i thought oh ok when i flipped it over and i looked at the price i just thought no thats crazy thats way too much for a candle this size it needs to be half this price say what you want about bath  body works but yeah youll pay  for a candle its a big candle it will last a long timemann im going to say something that may be a little bit personal but candles are like having the scent in this house where weve been locked up for the last year having things like that have been slightly joy making its made us a little bit happier a little more relaxed yes candle people get it done way beyond just what the inputs are and yet they are expensivehill well and to go back because we started this show with cryptocurrency were ending with i think you referred to it just short like an old world type of business  but to me thats one of the great things about investing i was saying to someone the other day i think i need to buy a few shares of sherwinwilliams i was thinking of the conversation i had with matt argersinger about housing and hes one of the smartest people i know about housing he was laying out this case for this is why we are going to see this overheated market for a while now sherwinwilliams for me the thesis all boils down to nobody buys a house and says all these colors are great  im not changing a single one inside its like youre always going to paymann these shoe marks on the wall i dont know how that happened but i got to sort that out i dont know if they had spaghetti explode but we got to fix that but yes sherwinwilliams does in fact cover everythinghill bill mann great talking to you thanks for being heremann thanks for having me on chris its been funhill as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so dont buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear thats going to do it for this edition of marketfoolery the show is mixed by dan boyd im chris hill thanks for listening well see you on monday
