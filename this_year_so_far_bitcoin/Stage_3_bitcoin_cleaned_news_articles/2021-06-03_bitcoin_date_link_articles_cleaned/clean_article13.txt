the man shooting the video wears a face mask rimless glasses and a white hard hat he is traipsing near the entrance of a warehouse full to the brim with stacks of internetconnected machines sitting idle in halfdarkness as the man turns the camera around to showcase the machines he says in mandarin “this is the stock for you it hasn’t even started mining bitcoin” the video a sales pitch received via text by a cryptocurrency entrepreneur based in switzerland is just one of many similar messages that have been flowing out of china over the past two weekschina has long been the world’s epicentre of bitcoin mining an energyguzzling process to secure the cryptocurrency network and mint new bitcoins via specialised machines known as “mining rigs” according to the university of cambridges centre for alternative finance over  per cent of miners working on the bitcoin blockchain were based in china as of april  but chinese miners are now on tenterhooks following a top government official’s announcement in a speech on may  that beijing would start to “crack down on bitcoin mining and trading behaviour”some miners reacted by scrambling to get rid of their rigs according to robert van kirk managing director of usbased mining equipment marketplace kaboomracks chinese miners are frantically “fireselling” their equipment even if the crackdown announcement was not immediately translated into regulation van kirk says it appears that some miners have been put off by the hostility “people mining there have realised that it may now be a riskier proposition to operate in china than they had anticipated” he says “they may be leaving regardless of whatever determination is made” as a consequence van kirk says used mining rigs are now being sold at a steep discount in some cases as much as  per cent lower than the usual price this is higher than figures from a reuters report this week featuring an interview with chinese mining machine manufacturer canaan which says that prices have fallen by  to  per cent from early maysome of those selling their rigs van kirk says are likely entrepreneurs whose hosting contracts – which allow them to rent space for their machines in a large chinese mining facility to take advantage of cheap energy and optimised infrastructure – were nearing their expiration dates because of the current uncertainty these people might have resolved to sell their rigs rather than renewing their hosting dealsother miners are planning to take their business elsewhere although it is hard to gauge how many are in the process of fleeing china right now bitcoin’s hashrate – a rough proxy for the number of mining rigs connected to the network – is about  per cent lower than it was on may  which suggests a largescale exodus has not happened yet and even that decrease could be explained by unrelated reasons but in the long run a shift in bitcoin mining’s geographic distribution might nevertheless be underwaya source familiar with china’s bitcoin mining industry speaking anonymously out of security concerns describes panicked miners transporting their machines to neighbouring kazakhstan “overnight” those who could not afford a quick move the source says are planning to wind down their large mining farms and continue their mining in a more decentralised inconspicuous fashiondidar bekbauov is the founder of kazakhstanbased xive a company that helps miners find space and convenient energy contracts in china bekbauov says that in the past fortnight he has been receiving daily enquiries from representatives of chinese miners looking to relocate to kazakhstan “these people are waiting for some clarification from the chinese government and they are looking for a plan b in case the government restricts or somehow bans mining altogether” bekbauov says kazakhstan already accounts for over six per cent of the world’s mining and is endowed with cheap coalproduced energy and a relatively cold climate which is great for miners who do not want to spend a fortune on cooling systems for their mining rigs another advantage is that it borders china and especially the xinjiang region where over a third of china’s mining takes place kazakhstan might certainly increase its global share of mining – bekbauov estimates that it could maybe double its capacity – but it is possible that it will simply be used as a stopover destination for miners looking to rehome their precious rigs elsewhere and that elsewhere some say is likely to be north america
