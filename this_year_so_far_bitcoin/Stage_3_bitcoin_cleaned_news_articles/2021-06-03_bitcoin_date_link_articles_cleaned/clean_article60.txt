inflation is starting to heat up and many experts believe that were just seeing the beginning precious metals are traditionally considered to be a smart way to hedge against high inflation but can cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cryptobtc and ethereum cryptoeth also fill that same role in this fool live video clip recorded on may  foolcom contributor matt frankel cfp and industry focus host jason moser discuss whether cryptocurrencies are good inflation hedges or notjason moser recently clearly weve been talking more and more about cryptocurrencies lately bitcoin being the standard i guess but then all of these other coins that come with the conversation crypto i think theres just a million different opinions out there you either buy into it or you dont i think its probably safe to say that you and i are both a bit more on the skeptical side of things but generally speaking why would crypto be seen as a hedge to inflationmatt frankel well first of all in the words of ringo starr i say this with peace and love i think the last week or so the price action in cryptocurrencies has shown that it is not a store of value yet whatever side of the argument youre on whether cryptocurrency is the future of finance or not a store of value doesnt lose  of its value in a week thats not a store of value thats literally the opposite of a store of value thats evaporating value ethereum is the other one which i actually think has more potential than bitcoin in a lot of ways its down  in the past week in one week i dont know if thats ever happened with the us dollar where its lost  of its value against any other major world currency in the span of a week its not there yet the big argument why bitcoin is a hedge if you ask certain people is because theres a finite amount of it same reason that gold is a hedge the government cant just print more gold the government cant just print more bitcoin i buy that to a certain extent if we had reached the point where bitcoin was widespread adoption it was a readily usable currency it was an accepted store value by more than just say  of the population which it is right now were just not at the point where you can call bitcoin a store of value and you have to have it be a store of value before you can really call it a hedge against inflation the recent price action really in my mind invalidates the hedge argument
