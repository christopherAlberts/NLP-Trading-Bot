lessons from roosevelt for the bitcoin revolutionthe digitalization of trust has farreaching implications for the global financial system jun   yves bonzonthe development of digital assets is continuing at a dizzying pace although there are more than  cryptocurrencies bitcoin is the pioneer in this space and it has achieved a unique status among converts to digital gold its market capitalization has reached one trillion dollars accompanied by sensational headlines and some impressive records today more than  of holders of bitcoin own fewer than  units not counting those who hold their bitcoin in regulated markets such as coinbase or kraken who account for another for the very young and some conspiracy theorists this cryptocurrency plays an active role as a haven from the monetary alchemists who currently run the central banks like gold it cannot be printed by governments and it causes problems in terms of storage in effect bitcoin this cult object can be viewed as digital gold indeed the data show that the proportion of longterm buyers of bitcoin is growing at the expense of those investing with the simple aim of tradingdigitalization of trustthe popularity of bitcoin obscures a number of more important trends that will lead to major economic changes over the next two decades first the performance of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has been connected with the excess liquidity on the markets in this respect we believe that the tipping point of monetary stimulus measures has already been reached and that we have probably already seen the peak values of risk assets the fact is that cryptocurrencies are especially vulnerable to a fall in liquidity which makes sense because the process increases the value status of fiat currenciesbut more important than this is the ability of bitcoin to digitalize trust thanks to the encryption technologies based on blockchain only recently have we begun to understand the implications of this and the potential applications some even believe there will be a new global financial system one that is decentralized and that works with independent and autonomous protocols allowing for commercial lending and insurance processes this would lead to disruption for regulated financial institutions as it would offer an open service with zero marginal costsin this way so the theory goes we would be liberated from governments and their monetary monopoly one of the main arguments that supports this thesis is that no one can close or intervene in the cryptocurrency universe as this would entail shutting down the entire internet governments would see their monetary monopoly destroyed by alternative currencies that are beyond their reach on this point we disagree and i believe that history can serve as a guide herethe lesson of roosevelt monetary erosionduring the great depression at the beginning of the  the us administration of franklin d roosevelt made a decisive shift in its policy when it decided to decouple the dollar from gold creating a successful relationship and ending the crisis as part of these exceptional measures president roosevelt issued an executive order that prohibited individuals from holding goldsimple and effective an individual could have gold but in doing so he or she would be committing a crime gold can be sold on the black market for dollars but it is obviously much more complicated to hold prohibited digital money in a portfolio that is not regulated such as an encrypted archive on a computerin summary in the discussion about bitcoin the most interesting aspect is the possibility of digitalizing trust thanks to blockchain technology we have only just begun to understand its implications and the applications this revolution will yield in terms of the way contracts are concluded traded and acquired with respect to the possibility of an independent financial system politicians love to hate the financial industry but the reality is that it is highly useful including for them in the end as roosevelt taught us digital gold cannot be erased but like its physical ancestor it can be prohibitedyves bonzon is the group chief investment officer of julius baer
