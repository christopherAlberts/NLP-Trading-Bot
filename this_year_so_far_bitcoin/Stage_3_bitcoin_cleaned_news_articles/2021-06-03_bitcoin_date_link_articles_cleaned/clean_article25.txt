distributed ledger technology dlt may be the next phase of the digital revolution tech entrepreneur rick falkvinge boldly predicts that “bitcoin will do to banks what email did to the postal industry” there’s keen interest in cryptocurrency and banks need to plan whether and to what extent they will participate confusion often surrounds the language of dlt cryptocurrencies and how they interrelate this blog explores the lexicon of virtual currencies and what they may mean for banksthe rise and fall and rise of bitcoincryptocurrencies – such as bitcoin ethereum dogecoin and others – have recently surged to highs that few investors could have predicted in the last year the total global value of the cryptocurrency market increased by usd  billion to more than  trillion however cryptocurrency is highly volatile due to a combination of factors because it is not dynamically managed by governments the price of digital assets such as bitcoin can move quickly and dramatically – a tweet from elon musk has been known to change the price up or down by  in a dayfor some time large banks have bought bitcoin as an investment jpmorgan chase will soon launch an actively managed bitcoin fund to broaden ownership some community bankers are embracing bitcoin as an investment opportunity for accountholders innovative fintech solutions enable participating banks to offer their customers the ability to buy sell and hold bitcoin via their bank accountsalongside growing acceptance and bullishness there’s also confusion and trepidation to help create some clarity let’s take a look at cryptocurrencies and their relationship with distributed ledger technology although related these terms are not synonymouscryptocurrencies – fad or futurecryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography making it impossible to forge or double spend as a digital asset distributed across numerous computers cryptocurrency serves many traditional functions of money as a medium of exchange a means of deferred payment and a store of valuehowever cryptocurrency still fails to meet one essential characteristic of money that of universal acceptance although accepted as payment by some businesses no cryptocurrency has gained universal acceptability some bigname businesses have wavered – for example in march tesla announced it would accept bitcoin for payment but suspended the decision in may citing environmental concerns related to bitcoinanother differentiator from traditional money is that cryptocurrencies are not issued by a monetary authority they are in effect “private” money the independent nature of cryptocurrency is neither good nor bad in itself but it has consequences cryptocurrencies cannot be manipulated or debased by government policy the price of a cryptocurrency is determined solely by supply and demand and is not pegged to anything while most major currencies are freely traded some are effectively tied to an underlying commodity such as oil and many are related to each otheran economist might describe the trading of cryptocurrencies as a “perfect market” where the price of the currency reflects all that’s known about it by all participants a doubter may question how much the participants know… but in any case cryptocurrencies enable funds transfers – currently in the trillions of dollars – without requiring a trusted third party such as banks exchanges and other traditional intermediaries this clearly has consequences for banks to consider as the develop and refine their digital transformation strategiescrypto playersas of may  the top  cryptocurrencies by value are bitcoin btc ethereum eth tether usdt binancecoin bnb cardano ada xrpripple xrp dogecoin doge polkadot dot usd coin usdc and internet computer icpblockchain and dltin practice banks and other financial intermediaries are holding cryptocurrency as an investment rather than a means of payment perhaps of greater interest to banks is the underlying technology – specifically blockchain and dltblockchain and dlt are both digitalized and decentralized books of record with a shared conceptual origin they’re often confused but really quite different blockchain is a type of database one which stores data in blocks that are chained together in chronological order blockchain is a type of digital ledger transfer dlt – but just as a swan is a type of bird not all birds are swans and it’s important to understand the taxonomyin simple terms dlt is a decentralized database that’s collectively managed by its participants the important takeaway is that there’s no central authority involved dlt offers a unique totally transparent way of conducting peertopeer transactions because the ledger is distributed it is far more difficult but not impossible to commit fraud or to hack the systemdlt has transformative potential in the financial market where vast amounts of data are exchanged in a regulated market compliance can be built in and trust assured without a detailed knowledge of counterparties dlt’s attributes can empower market participants to reduce costs boost efficiency and onboard new counterparties more quicklyuse cases for dlt in finance includeidentity services the immutability of a distributed ledger provides a new level of security all banks know how challenging it is to establish a single customer view across different jurisdictions and business lines with mutualized data management dlt allows permitted parties to share data securely and in real time which could address the twin challenges of know your customer kyc and anti money laundering amllending and trade finance some banks have formed syndicates to apply the power of dlt to syndicated lending lending can take place with fewer intermediaries and business processes are streamlined efficiency can be further boosted with smart contracts which go beyond the transaction to provide tamperproof records that cannot be amended by a single partyglobal payments and foreign exchange dlt can facilitate delivery versus payment of securities payment versus payment of foreign exchange and efficient crossborder payments banks may also adopt dlt to support internal funds transfers and reconciliationsgetting to the next levelgiven the transformational potential of dlt why the delay in uptake key challenges includeintegration banks and other financial institutions need to figure out how to integrate the new technology with existing systems and business processesstandards to realize its full potential dlt requires widespread collaboration and agreement of common standards although banks have formed dlt syndicates for specific purposes the real benefit will derive from the “network effect” of widespread adoptionsecurity and regulation some concerns remain about the potential for distributed ledgers to be manipulated by a group of bad actors these concerns may be allayed by regulators taking action to mitigate risk and introduce a regulatory frameworklegal further clarity is needed regarding ownership and jurisdiction of dlt data and transactionsthese are not insurmountable challenges but they need to be addressed likewise it is worth noting that current suspicions of the new technology are reminiscent of nascent ecommerce concerns my next blog will consider how banks can prepare for the arrival
