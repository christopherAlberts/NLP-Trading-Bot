if youre involved with a crypto or blockchainrelated project youve already thought about how to publicize it however due to the limitations imposed by social media and google crypto marketing is a slightly different entity than traditional adsit is a massive industry that is only going to get bigger it is a room with its founders the advertising networks that first launched and developed the service one of them is the bitmedia bitcoin advertising network and im on a mission to see what one of blockchains greatest advertising mediums has to givegetting ready to make wavesas an advertiser you have two options for tackling your marketing it is either paid ads or long and tedious community growth aimed at creating a loyal following the latter is absolutely fantastic especially when we take into account that the audience in  are all about sharing their values with the companies they choose but no community will ever spring without a continuous outreach push akin a flower that needs to be watered to growthe core idea behind bitcoin display advertising is to create brand awareness and turn clicks into clients nurturing a community around your brand but is bitmedia really worth your marketing budgethow to register at bitmediaioit must be streamlined simple and quick here this industry pillar of a platform carries no flaws once you complete the registration process it will be up to the bitmedia team to approve you since as they state only real blockchain projects are granted access this may seem slightly off but then again it starts to make a lot of sense given how many scams the blockchain industry is surrounded with another reason for having such practice in place is to protect the publishers that are part of the network to make sure that only real projects reach their audiencegeotargeting options at bitmediaiohow to set up your ad campaignan advantage that we noticed during this process is that there is an option to split your campaign into ad groups seasoned marketing specialists are well aware that testing creatives is an unremovable part of a solid marketing strategy and the ad group tool allows you to track each creative separately but still under one campaign name very convenientfunding can be done via fiat thanks to stripe integration or btc i have later found out that bitmedia also accepts eth and other top cryptocurrencies but it became apparent only after a quick conversation with my account managerthen comes the campaign type selection bitmedia seems to offer cpc and cpm crypto marketing which is pretty much all you need when launching an outreach further in there is an option to eitherlet the bitmedia team decide how to set up your targetingbroadcast your crypto banners across the whole network of publishersmanual targeting setupwhilst the first two options are pretty selfexplanatory it is the manual targeting that we would like to brief on unlike other bitcoin ad networks that we have previously tested bitmedia boasts a whitelisting feature that allows you to specify which countries are of key importance to you these regions will then become primary to the algorithm in terms of budget spend although other countries will still be included in the banner distributionsee also best crypto portfolio trackersother targeting options let you specify the device type your audience base uses the operating system their laptops run on ad rerun and frequency capping all great by the looks of it but it is the last two options that can play a distinctive role in the success of your crypto marketing campaign and strategy frequency capping is a gauge of how many times your ad will get shown to one specific user think of it as a reminder about your project to the users that have already seen your ads before in other words fq makes marketing smart by not pestering users with your bitcoin banners wherever they go but still nudging them in your direction from time to time ad rerun isn’t much different in terms of how important it is it is a feature that goes after users once they have already visited your website and it is when they are typically twice as likely to result in conversionfrequency capping settingsbottom lineas an advertiser i was keen to know where exactly my ads will be shown but for some unknown reason bitmedia doesn’t provide such information from the getgo nevertheless i have then spoken to the account specialist about it and the issue was clarified for me in a way this had seemed to be the only disadvantage that i came across as bitmedia’s list of publishers is not provided without a preliminary request the rest of the platform on the other hand seems to be exemplary and there is no surprise this bitcoin ad network gets chosen by the blockchain companies that form the blue chip share of the industry we are all obsessed with
