the bitcoin energy debate rumbles on seemingly without end bitcoiners are rightfully frustrated at having to defend bitcoin’s share of global energy production given the lack of equivalent scrutiny applied to other apparently wasteful applications which consume similar amounts of energy in a sense arguing over minutiae like the energy mix of bitcoin miners as i have done in the past is to miss the point the question ultimately boils down not to the particulars of mining but rather the societal merit of nonstate moneycoindesk columnist nic carter is partner at castle island ventures a public blockchainfocused venture fund based in cambridge mass he is also the cofounder of coin metrics a blockchain analytics startupyou could say the energy debate has a normative and an objective track the normative debate focuses on whether it’s legitimate to spend any of society’s energy resources on the production and maintenance of a nonstate monetary system this is the more important question and it involves weighing the relative cost of energy externalities against the relative benefits of sound money and freeing individuals globally from tyrannical monetary regimesthen you have the objective debate which focuses on how much energy bitcoin consumes which sources it draws from and what the picture is likely to look like in the future getting trapped on this turf is unfortunate as bitcoiners are forced to defend the costs of this industry while the critics enjoy an apparently consciencefree right to selectively question the energy uses of specific industries how often do you hear about the societal merit of game consoles clothes dryers or christmas lightssometimes however an argument comes along that is so clearly built on mistaken assumptions that it’s worth straying from the normative debate and back into the world of facts indeed arguments of this form have become disturbingly commonbitcoin consumes a lot of energy bitcoin  transactions per day if you combine  and  you can derive an eyepopping energy cost per transaction if you linearly extrapolate that analysis such that bitcoin satisfies the world’s transactions bitcoin will use more energy than exists on earththis line of reasoning might sound persuasive to the uninitiated but it is in fact completely flawed in an impressive number of ways yet we see it all the time here’s a recent example courtesy of eric holthaus one of the top climate journalists in the us and a published author on the topicat its current consumption rates bitcoin could never replace the global financial system right now with its high transaction fees bitcoin only can handle about  transactions a day at that rate bitcoin would require  the worlds total electricity just to process the  billion credit card transactions that take place every day bitcoin is not just inefficient its actively antiefficient it makes the world worse in exactly the opposite ways it’s trying to helpi’m going to be frank this line of reasoning is deeply misinformed pundits repeating this chain of logic are ensnared in a number of misconceptions mostly resulting from their unwillingness to engage with the subject matter itselfit’s possible they’re being deliberately provocative with these analyses but their claims just aren’t grounded in reality here’s whyenergy consumption derives from coin issuancetoday bitcoin miners earn around  millionday which annualizes to around  billion in miner revenue fully  of that revenue derives not from pertransaction fees but from the issuance of new bitcoins this issuance process is finite in fact it’s  done the rate of new coin issuance halves every four years as it approaches that  million limit these are the “halvings” you have probably heard about bitcoiners really love themsubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policyso the issuance component of miner revenue is structurally decaying over time unless you believe that the price of bitcoin is going to literally double in real terms every four years until  that expenditure and hence energy usage is going to declinebut why burn electricity to issue new coinssee also nic carter – what bloomberg gets wrong about bitcoin’s climate footprintput yourself in satoshi’s shoes you have just invented a new monetary system which you correctly believe can become a global monetary standard of consequence how do you distribute the coins you could email them to your friends but that would create a tiny group of privileged elites and compromise the credibility of the system you could simply claim the coins for yourself but most likely no one will adopt a monetary system where a single individual controls the vast majority of the wealthsatoshi’s solution was to distribute the coins by creating a game in which miners surrender something valuable – energy – in exchange for the right to claim them because mining is a radically free market miner margins are usually slim this means that even though they are literally creating new units of money that status doesn’t actually give them a huge advantage miners have to sell their coins on an ongoing basis to cover their costs – they are just an interface to the protocol itself there’s a reason venture funds like mine typically don’t invest in miners it’s a tough thinmargin business and involves lots of capital expenditureincidentally this mirrors the way gold mining works gold is a commodity sitting in ore underground but it takes a huge amount of work to actually extract it from the earth this is one of the features that makes gold an excellent monetary good – it’s hard to create and the miners don’t have a particularly big advantage in obtaining it similarly bitcoin mining is a synthetic approximation of gold mining instead of sifting rock you’re sifting through a mathematical spacewith this in mind you might begin to understand why issuance had to be done by burning energy provably because satoshi had no other way to fairly and in a decentralized manner issue units of digital value to the world other distribution methods have been flops airdrops were ignored initial coin offerings allow big venture funds to own mammoth quantities of the supply and faucet models are gimmickyminespotsatoshi has been absent for around a decade now but the issuance still proceeds according to the initial design with no interruption – a highly competitive free market process unlike the insiders that monetize their proximity to the federal reserve and the printing press the firms that create new units of bitcoin don’t gain much from their monetary proximity they eke out a thin marginso coin issuance had to be proofofwork and luckily enough it’s almost completed to ascertain the likely future energy outlay of the system fees have to be considered insteadone transaction does not equal one paymenti’ll keep this short bitcoin offers fast highassurance final settlement this means transactors can trust that value transfers are absolutely final within a short period of time this permits bitcoin to scale to enormous size – billiondollar transactions are common and settle without incident can you do that with visa bitcoin is therefore best understood as a highintegrity utilityscale settlement network similar to fedwire but arguably more resilient given fedwire’s recent outagesno surprise that like other realtime gross settlement systems bitcoin is a suitable base upon which other payments networks can be built these are numerous but they include offchain transactions at exchanges nearchain solutions like lightning sidechains with new trust models like liquid and rootstock and smart contract platforms like blockstack that rely on bitcoin’s security like visa with fedwire all of these payment layers introduce new trust models and different settlement guarantees but in exchange provide scalability and transactional creativityif we return to holthaus’ musing we see just how many wrong turns he has takenone bitcoin transaction therefore can settle thousands of offchain or nearchain transactions on any of these thirdparty networks exchanges and custodians could choose to settle up with each other once a day batching hundreds of thousands of transactions into a single settlement lightning channels could settle literally millions of payments into a single bitcoin transaction with a channel closurethis isn’t just speculative it’s happening today as fedwire’s  or so daily transactions reveal little about the total payments volume supported by the network bitcoin’s  daily transactions and  outputs do not tell the whole storybitcoin can be global money without changesif you’ve read this far you’ll have likely surmised that the extrapolations promoted by the critics are untethered from reality bitcoin’s base layer cannot for good reasons scale up to a global payments network nor should it the layered model – mimicking the way the traditional payments system developed – is what the community has wisely opted for bitcoin has a fundamental constraint in terms of the blockspace available which is a function of the cost to operate a node and be a peer on the network push too much data through bitcoin’s pipes and only individuals with large data centers will be able to validate the blockchain the trustleness of the system evaporates in that scenariosince bitcoin developers are laserfocused on keeping the data overhead of the system down you shouldn’t expect bitcoin to scale up to tens of millions of transactions per day while fees might increase and cause miner revenue to rise commensurately it’s worth thinking through where fees are likely to settle at equilibriumconsider a toy model it’s plausible that bitcoin could with efficiency savings process  million transactions a day average fees recently spiked to  per transaction for a week long period if bitcoin were settling  billionday instead of  billionday as it currently does transactors might be willing to stomach  pertransaction feessee also nic carter – the last word on bitcoin’s energy consumptionin a postsubsidy world even with those aggressive assumptions you get a miner revenue of  billion that’s not much more than the current annualized level of  billion at a more conservative  transactionsday and  average fees miner revenue would stand at a mere  billionso if we return to holthaus’ musing we see just how many wrong turns he has takenwe know now that bitcoin handles a relatively small number of final settlements but this is in no way a constraint on the system we don’t think of fedwire or chips as constrained due to their relatively small number of settlements we know that most of bitcoin’s energy is due to initial coin issuance which is declining with time we’ve looked at some toy fee models to ascertain that the doomsday scenarios are exaggerated we know that bitcoin and visa transactions aren’t comparable and we know that scaling bitcoin involves building out deferredsettlement payments systems on higher layers which ultimately settle to a small number of payments on the base layer
