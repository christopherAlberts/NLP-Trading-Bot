apparently canceling skinny jeans and side parts millennials  particularly white millennial women with whom the aforementioned skinny jeans and side parts are most frequently associated in pop culture  were up in arms attempting to defend their style choices now the feuds participants are taking part in one of internet dramas most storied traditions diss tracksi like skinny jeans and my side part  i use this emoji and i like the heart one such diss track goes to the tune of boys by lizzo so you think were old well i aint having that  we give you wifi and we can take it backthe sound which tiktok says was uploaded by the user mammy banter  appears to be from a sincedeleted video mammy banter published a followup video in which she acts out an exchange between two people talking about the track saying the song was supposed to be a parody mocking generational conflictwhile some millennials seem to have used to the sound earnestly and posted lipsync videos at least two appear to have deleted their videos others  presumably members of gen z  have recorded themselves reacting to the sound sometimes while melodramatically cryingadvertisementgen zs apparent distaste for millennials already caused a stir online during the summer of  after a tiktok comments section dunking on them went viral mammy banters boys parody is far from the only diss track that has spread on tiktok one of the most popular was uploaded by the musician sarah hester ross on february  but went viral on twitter during the last days of februaryhey gen z you can suck it you cant tell me what to wear  cause ive been rocking this side part since you had kermit on your underwear  so cute ross sang in the video which has more than  likes later she posted a duet with teenscientist who had written an ironic millennial diss track in responseadvertisement—beans after dark after dark goodbeanaltalt march  some feel that the diss tracks represent a disproportional responsethat trend has also inspired a litany of parodies such as one from tiktok creator emboogie who clarified in a later video that she was actually  years old and not a millennialmost recently the tiktok user  posted a rap defending eminem after reports emerged that gen z was trying to cancel him  the diss track went viral on both tiktok and twitter and seemed to represent a watershed moment suddenly people on twitter were becoming aware of the diss tracks and some millennials made moves to distance themselvesthe thing about this conflict as rebecca jennings wrote for vox is that while petty its not that deep generational conflict and mockery are baked into our culture and as far as stereotypes go it could be worse than skinny jeans and side parts  millennials have been subject to harsher judgment in the past as insiders kate taylor reported millennials earned a reputation for killing products or industries as a result of their bleak economic reality visàvis older generationsjennings noted socialmedia posts in which millennials seemed to take the style judgments with more gravitas than they were intended the diss tracks despite playing into the meme cycle of it all have a similar effect with some tiktokers expressing surprise at the vitrioladvertisementfurthermore its based on a monthsold meme about skinny jeans that has been circulating on tiktok and elsewhere online since at least july as ryan broderick reported in his newsletter garbage day  while the supposed gen z animosity for skinny jeans side parts and the crying laughing emoji has been most pervasive online during february the sentiment isnt new dire reactions  like the diss tracks parody or not  have helped to blow the entire affair out of proportion and spawn further mockeryat this point the entire thing has circled around to irony with people posting parodies of the diss tracks themselves—ryan ken has been in the knowles family group chat ryankenacts march  you think youre younger than me i was born in  and im still the special baby the actor and writer ryan ken said in a parody video of a white millennial woman making a gen z diss track you dont get to decide whats good i get to decide whats goodadvertisementultimately the debate over skinny jeans and side parts as well as the conflict between millennials and gen z which is being fought mostly on tiktok gen zs home turf amounts to very little its predicated on mostly lowstakes stereotypes and as some tiktok users said in videos  the backlash feels somewhat disproportionate against teenagers and young people who are spending their formative years in a pandemicat one point or another every generation stops being young and cool its just part of the game of growing older
