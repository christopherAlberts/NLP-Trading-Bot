quontic bank’s timing was either exquisite … or disastrous days after the bank formally launched an innovative bitcoin rewards checking account the price of a single bitcoin which had surged  in  plummeted in a frenzied selloffmany observers considered the rout an “expected correction” driven in part by a wave of profittaking at the start of the new year but the uk’s financial conduct authority ominously warned consumers looking to profit from cryptocurrency investments that they “should be prepared to lose all their money”not exactly the kind of headline that bank and credit union marketers love to readso far quontic bank is unfazed it had been working on the bitcoin checking project for two years and ceo steven schnall was very well aware of bitcoin’s price volatility in fact the selloff like big corrections in other markets represents a buying opportunity“i believe that this new entry price will attract a lot of buying activity and that we will begin to test the highs again in the near term” schnall told the financial brandquontic is a good candidate to buck conventional thinking converted into a forprofit community development financial institution cdfi from a traditional community bank in  quontic bills itself as the “adaptive digital bank” largely forsaking branches the bank has transformed into a digitalonly institution operating nationallywith its new bitcoin rewards checking account tiny quontic — with nonppp assets of about  million — joins the company of fintech heavyweights paypal and square in offering consumers a way to earn or buy bitcoin square’s cash app has become a popular way for consumers to buy sell or use bitcoinas schnall details in the interview below he expects bitcoin to continue to rise in value over time and become less volatile his program is a way to let consumers get their feet wet for free without risking their own funds and a way also to generate new accounts and deposits for the bankcan you describe the basic account functionality and what’s to comesteven schnall as launched consumers open the account and are issued a debit card when they use the card they earn  on their spending instead of getting a cash reward they’re awarded bitcoin — a small fraction of one given that a single bitcoin can be worth tens of thousands of dollars they’ll see their bitcoin on their monthly statement and at the end of the second quarter of  we’ll launch a brandnew mobile app where customers will be able to see their bitcoin balances in the app then in version three they’ll be able to buy and sell bitcoin in the app as wellwho are you partnering withschnall we partnered with a company called nydig as our fulfillment and custodial partner they’re building our api connectivity but most of what they do now is help to automate the purchasing of the bitcoin on behalf of customers it’s all invisible to the customers we also have partnered with fis to build out the mobile app functionality that i just mentionedwhy did you decide to offer bitcoin reward checkingschnall well we love bitcoin and we think it’s gaining a lot of momentum with both consumers and institutional owners from what we can gather fewer than  of americans actually own bitcoin but with its price movement in  we think more and more people are going to want it however there is a huge segment of the population that’s intrigued by bitcoin but doesn’t understand it wellin our surveys we found that many people won’t invest in bitcoin because the price is too volatile other people don’t own it simply because they don’t know how to get itwe felt that by offering bitcoin rewards we could overcome those obstacles for consumers where they don’t have to risk their own money the volatility isn’t a factor because we’re giving them the bitcoin for free if it goes up they’re earning a reward that can appreciate significantly unlike cash back or membership miles that are effectively a static assetread moreregister for this free webinar leveraging location for growth how to expand into new markets and thrive to be competitive postcovid financial institutions must grow to survive—often by seeking new opportunities in new markets enter your corporate email addressdo people have to do anything special to get this accountschnall no when someone opens an account with us they automatically get a subaccount at nydig the consumer doesn’t have to do anything we do all of the upfront kyc work and all the vetting nydig relies on the intelligence we dohow has it been going so farschnall we’ve been taking it slowly initially — we haven’t marketed it we wanted to make sure that everything worked right and that our customer service was where it needed to be we get a lot of phone calls from people asking all kinds of questions and so we’re building out our library of bitcoinrelated faqs on the website we’ll be ready to start marketing by the end of january what are the benefits to the bankschnall almost all of the bitcoin rewards accounts that we’ve opened so far have been new customers we love helping facilitate people’s introduction to bitcoin but ultimately the reason the bank offers a product like this is so we can pick up lowcost deposits these are noninterest bearing checking accounts we use the interchange that we earn when people use their debit card to pay for the bitcoinhow did you settle on  as the reward amountschnall it approximates what we earn from interchange when a customer uses the debit card most banks market for checking accounts because they earn all that interchange and it’s a big revenue item for them we’re willing to forego that revenue and use it to buy the bitcoin in exchange for the lowcost depositswhat does the typical user look likeschnall we don’t have a critical mass yet but so far more men than women have signed up in terms of age it’s more people in their  and  than young millennial types but again it’s earlyhow does the price volatility of bitcoin impact your programschnall we understand that bitcoin is inherently and predictably volatile it will remain so until ownership moves towards a critical mass as we see more and more institutional money move into bitcoin and stay invested we will see volatility taper off this will take some time but we are still confident that the consumer wants inwhat makes you confident about bitcoin’s futureschnall for one thing i’m not alone in that confidence massmutual for example bought  million of bitcoin square bought  million as more and more people start to gravitate towards bitcoin as an asset class you’re going to see more demand and more money move in and the price will go up remember the idea behind bitcoin is that there’s a finite supply —  million potential bitcointhat doesn’t mean the price of bitcoin won’t drop in half tomorrow but if it did i think all that would happen is people who are sitting on the sidelines would start pouring in and the price would rebound pretty quicklyread moreonly a handful of financial institutions enable consumers to purchase bitcoin do you see that changingschnall based on things i’m seeing and people i’m talking to in the industry that number is going to increase exponentially in the near term consumers don’t trust the crypto exchanges those exchanges are regulated but not like banks are but once jpmorgan chase and other big banks start saying ‘not only can you buy investments from us but you can also buy bitcoin through us and we will custody it for you’ that will give customers comforti don’t think you’re going to see many banks building their own custody solutions however they’ll outsource them as we did to firms like nydig who already have the proven protocols and infrastructure to be able to host and custody bitcoin securelywill other institutions follow your lead with a bitcoin rewards programschnall building this rewards program is not an easy lift it’s taken us two years to get to get to this point building the policies and procedures the infrastructure the api connectivity and the customer service we’re paving the path here but i think you’ll see others launch bitcoin rewards programs and then consumers will have more choiceswhat’s the outlook for bitcoin as a medium of exchangeschnall i believe people see bitcoin more as a store of wealth much as they do with gold you don’t want to spend your gold also if you own bitcoin and you did want to spend it every time you did that you could have a taxable gain — for example if you acquired bitcoin when it was  then spent it when it was at and from a technological standpoint the blockchain technology underlying bitcoin can’t handle billions of people making daily transactions in bitcoin so i see bitcoin more as a store of wealth
