bitcoin is obviously scarce and it seems to be becoming scarcer over timebitcoin is obviously scarce and it seems to be becoming scarcer over timebut perhaps due to the current bull run doubts about both of these propositions are seemingly on the rise among bitcoin skeptics criticisms come in a few different flavors the main one that i have seen argues that bitcoin cannot be scarce because it is highly divisible recently that particular line of reasoning was subject to some particularly colorful discussions on twitterin this article i want to clarify bitcoin’s scarcity let’s start with what the concept of scarcity actually meanswhat is scarcityscarcity is a core concept within economics this is attested to by the concept’s frequent appearance in characterizations of the disciplinethomas sowell for instance characterizes economics as “the study of the allocation of scarce resources with alternative uses” in his book “basic economics”somewhat more elaborately in the book “economics” paul samuelson characterizes the discipline as “economics is the study of how people and society end up choosing with or without the use of money to employ scarce productive resources that could have alternative uses to produce various commodities and distribute them for consumption now or in the future among various persons and groups in society it analyzes the costs and benefits of improving patterns of resource allocation”both sowell’s and sameulson’s characterizations borrow from the famous characterization of the discipline made by lionel robbins in his “an essay on the nature and significance of economic science in the early twentieth century “the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses”the concept of scarcity in all of these characterizations of the economics discipline can be roughly summarized in the following wayhumans have a variety of wants such as living by the beach playing nintendo every day eating great food socializing with friends having the latest gadgets becoming a good basketball player and so on both material and nonmaterial resources are required for realizing these wants time money labor raw materials land mobile phones refrigerators and so onin some contexts the resources we require to achieve our wants are in abundancefor instance everyone desires to breathe in order to live on earth that just requires the air which covers the surface of our planet while the air might be limited in a physical sense it is essentially limitless given human wants hence air is not scarce but abundant one might argue of course that “clean air” is not abundantby contrast most human ends require resources that are scarce that is they require resources which are limited given all of the human wants that it might support in fulfilling it is important to understand that we are not just talking about some physical limitation here — air to breathe is also physically limited in this sense instead the resource must also be limited with regards to what humans actually desireimportantly scarcity and abundance are contextual concepts while air might be abundant in our standard human setting it might not be abundant for a human colony on mars it certainly is not abundant for a deepsea diversimilarly while oil might generally be scarce in the modern world it was not really scarce for most people before the  century when applications for it began to emerge farmers that discovered it on their lands probably thought it was a nuisanceto understand the concepts of scarcity and abundance more clearly lets work through an example that sowell makes in “basic economics”many people in principle would want a house by the beach but there is only a limited amount of land by the beach so even if we constructed houses on all of the suitable land next to our beaches we would still not be able to meet everyone’s desires with respect to having beachfront property hence land by the beach is scarce some demand for it will have to be left unsatisfiedbut the limitations experienced from the land next to our beaches extend further it for example can also be used for creating natural parks oceanic research facilities hotels recreational facilities and so on dedicating all of the land that is suitable to beachfront property impinges on these latter human wants that are also commonwhy is this all so important to economicsscarce resources with alternative uses mandate an economic system that is a system which makes decisions on production and distribution in order to meet human wants whether a free market a feudal system or a communist utopia every society must make these choices given scarce resources with alternative usesif resources were not scarce there would be no need for economies or a scientific discipline to study them hence the centrality of the concept of scarcity within the disciplinecompare various economics textbooks under a microscope and you will probably see that they do not use the term “scarcity” completely consistently but all roughly mean something as explained above with the term and that is sufficient for our purposesis bitcoin scarcegiven the characterization of scarcity above we must conclude that practically all of the resources we commonly use are scarce something like air is the exception rather than the rule and so it should not come as a surprise that bitcoin is scarceto put it fairly simply i would be very happy with  bitcoin my guess is that i could probably find quite a few other people that would be happy with  bitcoin so many in fact that we cannot all own  bitcoinsgiven the wide variety of ends we can achieve with our bitcoin — buying a house a car a holiday storing our wealth or whatever — this desire to hold bitcoin should be obvious all money that is in relatively common use — even if it experiences more monetary inflation than bitcoin — is also scarceimportantly the fact that bitcoin as most other monies in common use is highly divisible — a precondition for being decent money i would argue — does not make it abundant it will still be no problem to find more people that want to have  bitcoin than there are bitcoin in existenceconsider the following for an illustrative comparison suppose a group of people is walking in a desert with a bucket of water and a syringe that can easily divide that amount of water into very many very small amounts does this somehow make the water nonscarce of course not surely they have less than what they ultimately want in the burning sunbitcoin is becoming scarcerscarcity is not just a binary concept it seems that we can also sensibly speak of resources becoming more or less scarce that can be the product of both supply and demand changesfor instance suppose that heavy earthquakes destroyed much of the beaches in a particular area so that there is less land by the beach available as long as demand for land by the beach stayed relatively consistent we are fairly reasonable in stating that “land by the beach has become scarcer”put differently “less scarce” in this example just means that the amount of land relative to our desires for that land — for creating beachfront property oceanic research facilities hotels recreational facilities and so on — has decreasedin what direction has bitcoin’s scarcity been heading and how will it develop in the futureat the moment bitcoin still experiences a small amount of monetary inflation — about  percent per year this was even higher in the past and has been a decreasing factor on its scarcity from the supply side people also lose and find previously lost bitcoin it’s difficult to state how this has impacted the historical trend of bitcoin’s scarcitysometimes bitcoin is charged with having monetary inflation through the backdoor one can after all copy the code change some parameters and start a new digital currency that criticism of course makes no sense no one would argue that printing monopoly money somehow creates monetary inflation for the us dollarmost importantly with regards to bitcoin’s scarcity the desire for bitcoin has been increasing over time — though admittedly with heavy fluctuations this growth in demand has surely outweighed any of the impact from changes in bitcoin’s supply hence bitcoin’s scarcity has been increasing with timeand i am somewhat expecting this trend of increasing scarcity to continuebitcoin has a transparently encoded supply function which currently has low monetary inflation and this monetary inflation will decrease further over time given the strong consensus over this production function it is unlikely to change in the future bitcoin also offers people new means for financial freedom and sovereigntyall this is fairly interesting in a world where the money supply is not particularly transparent unpredictable and subject to extensive surveillance and control it leads me to think that demand for bitcoin will continue to increase over time given the rigid supply function i would therefore not be surprised to see bitcoin’s scarcity continue to increase many people will probably only be able to own a small amount of bitcoin in the futurethis trend of course is not an inevitability perhaps something could still break bitcoin’s production algorithm and produce rampant monetary inflation or perhaps demand will start decreasing consistently after this current bull run and never recover while i do not deem such scenarios likely they are surely not impossibledivisibility and scarcitywe have already established that bitcoin’s divisibility does not make it nonscarce however we need to explore the issue a bit further as divisibility does impact the degree of scarcityimagine for instance that there was only one bitcoin in existence and that it was completely indivisible that would not make for very good money so i would expect there to be little to no demand for bitcoin in that case hence bitcoin would not be as scarce as it is nowalternatively suppose that there were  million bitcoin but that you could not divide them any further suppose further that demand conditions were relatively similar to those currently dominating the market assuming decreasing marginal utility from bitcoin ownership it might be the case that bitcoin is actually scarcer in this situation as compared to the current situationteasing out the relationship between divisibility and scarcity for bitcoin — or really any other resource — can be a bit complicated in any case while we can acknowledge that the current level of bitcoin’s divisibility impacts the degree of scarcity compared to alternatives it is surely inaccurate to claim that the current level of divisibility negates its scarcity entirelyconclusionbitcoin is scarce that fact is not changed by its divisibilityof course i am making those claims against the standard economic understanding of the term “scarcity” but i think that any other reasonable sense of the term would have to draw the same conclusions it would certainly require a rather strange understanding of the term “scarcity” to claim that bitcoin is not in fact scarce one that is likely to be meaningless and unproductive for scientific analysisbitcoin scarcity also has been increasing over time despite that the system has been subject to monetary inflation this is because demand for bitcoin has increased over time though admittedly with some severe volatilityi would expect this trend of increasing scarcity to continue as its transparency predictability consensual nature and censorship resistance make bitcoin a unique monetary asset though all of that is certainly not a giventhis is a guest post by janwillem burgers opinions expressed are entirely
