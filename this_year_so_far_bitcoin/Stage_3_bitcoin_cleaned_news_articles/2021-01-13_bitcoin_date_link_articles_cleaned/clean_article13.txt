bitcoin is about as divisive an investment as anything out there on one hand its proponents say its the future of currency set to break the hold that governments have over money its detractors on the other hand argue that its not really worth anything since its wild volatility and owners proclivity to hoard it make it essentially useless as money ironically both groups use the recent surge in its value to support their arguments over the past year bitcoin has gained over  in value while the grayscale bitcoin trust otcgbtc a way to gain exposure to bitcoin without actually dealing with the challenges of physically owning it is up more than on the dec  edition of the wrap on motley fool live host jason hall asked motley fool contributors lou whiteman and brian feroldi to weigh in on bitcoin will the biggest and most popular cryptocurrency once again prove a better investment than stocks in  check out the video below for their predictions and more importantly their insight into bitcoin including the bull and bear cases for cryptocurrencies going forwardtranscriptjason hall buy sell or hold on this lou you go first bitcoin will be a better investment than stocks in lou whiteman yeah as of a couple of hours ago bitcoin was up  yeartodate and granted it is bitcoin so that may be off but i am going to go with it versus the sp  maybe what  since theres no real way to use my brain to answer this question im going to go with conventional wisdom and say that the one that was up  this year will under perform next year beyond that i dont have a cluejason hall brian feroldi lets have fun with thisbrian feroldi im going to say its going to outperform i dont see the stock market doing much next year which probably means its going to go up another  if somebody owns bitcoin or wants to bet on bitcoin i have no problem with that i understand the rationale for doing so i dont think that people that buy bitcoin are crazy or anything like thatthe tricky thing about bitcoin is theres no way to value it none it doesnt produce cash flow it will never produce cash flow what is the reason that it went up  and something percent this year i dont know excitement what is the reason that it cant go up  next year i dont know nothing i will say that tom gardner pick this as his  bagger over the next decade he said bitcoin because this has absolutely no track record and were not going to get held accountable for anything ill say bitcoin outperforms the stock market in jason hall i am going to say i dont know im going to hold on this i really im to brians point this is why i dont own bitcoinwhen i look at any investment i try to think about the things that drive its value for stocks for companies as a long term investor its cash flow companies that can grow their earnings overtime and by owning that company the value that i own goes up with it over time or goes down sometimes the problem with bitcoin is because it doesnt earn money and its still too hard to really understand what is its utility value its real true mass utility value that makes it worth more than  per coinits really easy to make a very viable case for it losing half its value next year or  of its value because at the end of the day the thing that drives it is people think its going to go up  thats it its not because it has this really great use case i know theres a lot more nuance in that because the money printer goes brrrr you think about all of these trillions of dollars being added to fiat currencies the idea is this is something that there is a very limited known maximum supply of and the number of us dollar continues to go up thats part of the ideabut what are they worth what can you do with them i cant go buy new socks with them  very easily i know if i have money in a bank in a savings account i have fdic insurance that protects it i know with bitcoin if somebody manages to get whatever the little identifiers are they take it there are so many things about it that put it in that too hard pile for me thats why im holding because i dont know whats going to happena lot of the things that are going to drive the value of bitcoin i think are going to be sentiment sentiments are going to be underpinned by the economy our ability to move beyond the coronavirus return to normal who knows i dont knowlou whiteman i think you hit on a key thing though as we all know theres much of chagrin of i think its williams jennings bryan the dollars arent really based on anything either anymore the dollar is the perceived value of what someone else feels its worth the agreement with bitcoin the bull case is it really doesnt matter its not backed on anything if people are willing to accept it for goods or if there can be a mutual agreement on what its worth and that is playing out i doubt that plays out at  a coin or whatever it is right nowbut paypal theres a lot of companies moving toward legitimizing it my real question is what need does it serve other than dark semilegal illegal  even if it can be used what need does it replace that the dollar doesnt do better and when does that happen in terms of widespread usage but as people start to make it easier to get trade for goods and stuff i think that is the bull case that it becomes legitimate on its ownjason hall i think that will completely undermine the investing thesis because at the end of the day people dont want to own a currency because you know what currencies do they hold value they are predictable you know how many of that currency is going to take to go buy a gallon of milk or put gas in your fuel tank i think that would immediately underpin people wanting to own it because its not going to go up if it goes up that is deflationlou whiteman yeah or conversely it will never be legitimized because why the heck would you trade something that goes up  a year for a gallon of milkjason hall i think its a disservice to continue to call these cryptocurrencies currencies because their use case is never going to be as transactional products last thing i want to say because we can talk about this for an hour because i think this is important to your point the counter is the us dollar has a hell of a lot of things backing up its value the entire output of the united states of america and the backing of the us governmentthats still worth a lot you know how you know thats a lot because of the trillions of new dollars that have gotten thrown into the economy and theres massive demand for those us dollars that have been soaked up just like that theyve just been soaked upis there a price to pay down the road probably none of us know what that price is going to be though brian feroldi anything to add to that i know thats a lotbrian feroldi i agree with everything you said i dont think its a currency either exactly to lous point isnt there a story about somebody the first transaction they bought pizza at a cost of  bitcoins or something maybe jason hall its  pizza brian feroldi i think its in the millions at this point jason this is something that if you buy it you hoard it why would you spend it its not a part of my portfolio i have nothing wrong with somebody taking   of their portfolio and putting it in thisjason hall i agree and im pulling for anybody that does i hope it does well
