tether also known as usdt is what’s known as a stablecoin it’s a place where you can save your funds in cryptocurrency as opposed to fiat currencythe appeal lies in giving your portfolio diversification into the tempting world of cryptocurrency while avoiding the volatility of cryptos such as bitcoin and ethereum but it’s also used to cheaply and quickly trade cryptocurrenciestether was conceived in  and its value is directly linked to the us dollar for this reason it offers more stability than volatile coins like bitcoin the idea is that for every usdt issued  is kept in reserve at the tether foundation this is meant to keep the price stabilized at a dollarback in  the supply was under a million dollars it surpassed this in  and by early  had reached  billion today usdt has a whopping  market capaccording to coinmarketcap today tether is the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization this surely shows many people are keen to support tetherin the past  hours at the time of writing tether has generated volume of  billion that’s more than double bitcoin’s volume at  and  ethereum’s at  billion in fact as of february   of all bitcoin trading was carried out in usdtthis confirms that usdt is by far the most popular stablecoin in the world the reasons are stability liquidity and costspeaking to coinbase earlier this year cto of tether and bitfinex paolo ardoino said“we’re not sure that anyone could have foreseen this level of growth and use cases of tether at the very beginning we were confident that it was a useful token but didn’t anticipate quite how useful it could be”faster and cheaperone reason stablecoins are popular is that they offer a faster and cheaper way to move money around to wire money from a bank often takes a minimum of three days unless paying huge charges stablecoin trading on the other hand is instantaneous that’s because it’s centralized whereas cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are decentralized and can take longer to settlecrypto is traded  hours a day seven days a week unlike traditional financial markets crypto never sleepscontroversies surrounding tethertether’s origins are steeped in controversy and in the world of crypto it’s taken a while to establish its footing the point of tether being pegged to the us dollar is to protect against market uncertainty and offer constant liquidity in the marketbut there have been questions regarding how truly pegged to the dollar it actually is and in  a tether lawyer stated each usdt was only  backed by fiatfor this reason some consider tether a ‘partial reserve stablecoin’ – one that does not have the full backing of the usd but its convenience and ease of use is propping it up and that’s unlikely to change unless there’s an obvious loss in its peg to the dollarwho controls tetherdespite it being backed by the blockchain technology tether is surprisingly less transparent than its crypto counterparts this has led to heavy criticism of the coin and suspicion regarding its purpose some believe the presence of tether is helping to artificially inflate the price of bitcoin and its peersan academic peerreviewed paper published in  set out to investigate whether tether influenced bitcoins rise in the  crypto boom during  the three main exchanges used for trading tether were bitfinex poloniex and bittrex at the time kraken was the main exchange where tether could be exchanged for usdafter analysing the flow of tether through the system the paper concluded that the distribution of tether into the market was from a large player rather than widely dispersed interest that’s because more than half of the exchange of tether for bitcoin took place at bitfinex a hong kongbased cryptocurrency exchange and was associated with one large playerit turns out bitfinex officials are responsible for tether’s origins and this led the new york attorney general nyag to file a lawsuit accusing bitfinex of using tether reserves to bail themselves out of trouble this case was settled privately in februarytether  bitfinex have reached a settlement with newyorkstateag after  years and  pages of info shared we admit to no wrongdoing and will pay  to resolve this matter  — tether tetherto february   tether usdt and bitfinex reach a settlement with the us district attorneyreducing concernsthe nyag alleged bitfinex and tether were covering up losses of around  million in customer funds it also alleged that tether misrepresented maintaining adequate reserves of one us dollar for every one tether coin in settling bitfinex and tether agreed to pay  million cease trading with new york residents and entities and provide quarterly transparency reports to the nyag bitfinex and tether neither admit nor deny any of the nyag’s findingsnew york attorney general letitia james said“bitfinex and tether recklessly and unlawfully coveredup massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines tether’s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by us dollars at all times was a lie these companies obscured the true risk investors faced and were operated by unlicensed and unregulated individuals and entities dealing in the darkest corners of the financial system”crypto capital fiascothe upshot of this is that in  tether loaned  million to bitfinex it used  million of this which the nyag allege was a coverup for the  million of customer funds it lost bitfinex lost  million after payment processor crypto capital seized the funds and it’s still trying to recover thisthe company said“bitfinex continues to make progress in its recovery actions against the crypto capital group around the world”in any case the money tether loaned bitfinex has now been paid back and the loan facility cancelled bitfinex repays tetherto balance of  under credit facility loans repaid early and in full all interest has been paid credit facility now cancelled  — stuart hoegner bitcoinlawyer february   bitfinex repays tether loanthe controversy surrounding tether has been extensively debated in recent years but throughout that time tether’s value continues to climb and now that a settlement has been reached concerns are diminishing there’s also since been an independent audit conducted into tether’s transparency and it concluded it to be fully backed by us dollar reserves further easing concernsassurance opinion confirms tetherto’s reserves fully backed company shares as part of ongoing transparency commitment our statement httpstcouwhqwbxiyg assurance opinion  — tether tetherto march   tether’s reserves are fully backedbut tether’s legal battles are not yet over real estate investor and former nfl lineman reggie fowler was arrested by the fed for operating an illegal crypto banking scheme he’s been accused of allegedly providing tether and bitfinex with shadow bankingmeanwhile the us department of justice doj is investigating whether tether uses usdt to inflate the entire cryptocurrency landscape both cases continuerising popularity in asiatether is exceptionally popular in asia chinese citizens can’t legally buy bitcoin so they have to use cloak and dagger tactics the usual state of play is to use a vpn to set up a crypto trading account they then use yuan to buy usdt being pegged to the usd gives them a good rate of exchange this is then traded with bitcoin which can then be used directly for offshore purchasesanother reason for heightened usdt activity in asia is a practice called shadow banking which is commonplace this refers to unregulated nonbank financial institutions so the activity from this area of the market could be another driving force behind the inflated tether volumea selection of stablecoinsstablecoins have become a popular mainstay of the cryptocurrency markets because they offer liquidity and stability they’re also a critical part of crypto tradingthe stability helps reduce the uncertainty of cryptocurrencies across the board thereby helping reduce the likelihood of a bearish shift in the markettether can safely be considered the first successful stablecoin and has since spawned many other fiat stablecoinsusd coin usdc is one of them and the gemini dollar gsud another but there are many more including paxos standard token pax binance usd busd trueusd tusd facebook’s libra fbo and makerdao daithe gemini dollar was created by the winklevoss twins in  and claims to be a transparent stablecoin it’s an  token built on the ethereum networkalthough tether is pegged to the us dollar other stable coins have appeared tied to alternative stable assets such as palladium and goldfor example paxos gold paxg is backed by physical gold then there’s dai which defies logic by pegging itself to ethereumreasons to be bullish on tethermany bitcoin bulls claim it to be the digital equivalent to gold but bitcoin’s volatility is historically more unpredictable than gold granted it does seem to be calming down in  to a greater degree than it did historically but it’s still early days in the life of the coin compared with a longstanding asset such as goldso here’s where tether can offer more of a stability guarantee than bitcoin can thus farthe fact tether’s value continues to climb despite court cases and suspicion shows there’s clear demand for its presence and now the legal battles have been partially dealt with usdt has further credibility and staying powerthis year it’s not just retail investors riding the crypto bull run institutional investors are at the helm and this is driving growth across the board an increase in interest from fortune  companies the financial industry and many publicly traded companies is helping grow acceptance this is likely to lead to a regulatory framework that includes stablecoins backed by the banking systemreasons for cautionbut that eventuality doesn’t necessarily mean it will favour tether being that it’s hong kong based and ussino relations are far from perfect right now there’s a good chance an alternative stablecoin could become the token of choice plus many central banks are in the process of developing their own form of cryptocurrency for instance the chinese stablecoin the digital yuanthe entire cryptocurrency landscape is still new in the history of financial markets therefore it’s difficult for anyone to predict where each coin will be in the coming years there’s no doubt the bulls are out in force and with the global economy under extreme pressure good reason to believe this will continuenevertheless there are still several red flags surrounding tether so it seems unlikely that it will rise up and displace bitcoin anytime soon and whether tether will remain the world’s most popular stablecoin remains to be seen
