the internal revenue service could be missing out on collecting approximately  trillion every year from taxpayers who are not paying their full tab charles rettig the tax collector agency’s commissioner said tuesday“it would not be outlandish to believe that the actual tax gap could approach and possibly exceed  trillion dollars” rettig told members of the senate finance committee“we do get outgunned there’s no other way to say it” he later addedthe  trillion number was “shocking” said sen ben cardin a democrat from maryland“ ‘we do get outgunned there’s no other way to say it’ ” — internal revenue service commissioner charles rettigthe figure is massive by itself but rettig’s own estimation during tuesday’s hearing of the federal tax gap — which is the difference between taxes legally owed and taxes actually paid — was a drastic upward revision of the irs’s own projectionsrettig said the agency’s existing estimates of the tax gap read like they’re “from the dark ages” the most recent official irs estimates said that every year from  and  taxpayers failed to pay  billion in tax money irs compliance efforts and late payments narrowed that annual divide to  billiona lot’s changed since then rettig explained starting with rise of cryptocurrencythe irs counts virtual currency like bitcoin btcusd  and ether ethusd  as property when an owner profits off the currency the irs says that’s subject to capital gains rules — but the irs has to know about the transactions before it can assess taxesin recent years the irs has been stepping up enforcement on cryptocurrency tax compliance most recently by obtaining a court order for account information for users at one digital exchangeforeign income such as offshore accounts and illegal source income also contribute to the tax gap rettig saidless than a month ago irs researchers were some of the authors on a new study that looked into tax evasion and pointed a finger at the wealthiest taxpayersunderreporting for taxpayers on the bottom half of the income ladder rose  when researchers reexamined returns using more stringent methods it jumped  for the top  of earners the researchers considered offshore accounts and passthrough entities as tactics to mask wealth“we are up against more sophisticated elements in the community practitioners and others and the tools that they are using” rettig said tuesday“ ‘the irs is up against a shrinking staff and budget meaning the agency is performing fewer complex audits to recoup cash’ ”the irs is also up against a shrinking staff and budget which means the agency is performing fewer complex audits to recoup cash in the last  years the irs is down  members in its enforcement wing alone rettig said “that has to have an effect and it does” he told lawmakersthat’s where the federal budget comes in president joe biden is pushing for massive infrastructure spending which would be powered by corporate tax hikeshis administration recently released a budget proposal that would set aside  billion for the irs if enacted that would be a  increase from this year’s level according to the tax policy centerthe point of the irs budget bump is to beef up oversight of rich taxpayers and corporations the white house said last week the money is meant “to increase oversight of highincome and corporate tax returns ensuring that the wealthy and wellconnected pay what they owe and play by the same rules as everybody else”if it goes through the agency’s budget increase would be about  billionwith that cash rettig said tuesday he could do things like hire  more employees in the enforcement side of the agencyit’s not like irs staffers are resigned to tax cheats rettig said tuesday “our people are equally offended by people who don’t comply”
