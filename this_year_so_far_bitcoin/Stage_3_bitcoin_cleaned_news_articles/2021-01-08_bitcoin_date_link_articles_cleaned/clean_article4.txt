i won’t do that again money reimagined goes on break for three weeks and what happensbitcoin soars  more than  americans die of  and oh yeah an insurrection happens in washington dcon the second the numbers speak for themselves a heartbreaking failure of human organization on the third i’m too gobsmacked to speak anyway so today we discuss the first i want to show how bitcoin’s volatility is not a problem for its longterm viability as some critics claimsubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policyyou’ll note a new format to parts of the newsletter more changes to come in the weeks ahead let us know what you think of the bullet point format and other changesalso the first  episode of our “money reimagined” podcast is out this one featuring matthew davie of kiva and alpen sheth of mercy corps looks at the charity organizations’ efforts to drive financial inclusion through grassroots empowerment and whether or not crypto will succeed in breaking down a usdominated “philanthropy industrial complex”bitcoin’s yearend moves weren’t all in one direction in the  hours between new york daybreak on sunday jan  and monday jan  it plunged  from a high of  to a low of  only to recover all that within the next  hours and to reach  just before this newsletter went outsuch wild swings are fodder for nocoiners like jacob silverman who declared in the new republic “that bitcoin unlike gold is worthless”seems reasonable right how can something of such mercurial value act as a medium of exchange store of value and unit of account – the three functions of moneyit’s a duplicitous argument bitcoin could never have birthed with immediate price stability if it’s to fulfill its “digital gold” use case it must go on a journey from misunderstood unappreciated concept to widespread acceptance that takes time along the way it will rise in value but as speculators buy and sell it will do so in fits and startshow long will this process take well how long did gold take to become a widely accepted store of value this hilarious video portraying a vendor rejecting a customer’s offer of gold “the currency of the future” instead of a chicken to buy five rat skins and some tepid lemonade suggests what it was up againstpatience please bitcoin is not yet digital gold it is becoming digital goldthis is why the recent rash of highprofile price forecasts matters  says jpmorgan  says citibank  says guggenheim they’re not timefixed price targets for a stock that will later grow further in value they are stabs at a fair value once bitcoin attains that needed establishment statusit’s also why the second part of crypto pioneer wences casares’ oftcited binary framing – that bitcoin could go to  million but could also go to zero – still holds that’s looking less and less likely but if advocates can’t get past widespread nocoiner mistrust bitcoin will fail to achieve its potentialsatoshi’s resolution of the byzantine generals’ dilemma gives bitcoin the potential to be a benchmark of digital scarcity one that’s badly needed for a global economy that’s increasingly digitized and internetbased but to become that universal standard it must go through a narrativedriven cultural process of awareness most important people need to appreciate that the most important aspect of bitcoin’s security model is not really its tech but the growing size of its network – in other words the selffulfilling nature of its acceptanceonly if and when that process reaches critical mass can we then start to apply this widely accepted digitally scarce store of value to new forms of monetary utility – perhaps as a settlement layer for lightweight lightning payments perhaps as programmable collateral to replace sovereign debt as the foundation of the global bond market or bothwe have a long way to go before we get there for now just enjoy the ridewhales vs minnows“this time is different” is a dangerous phrase as carmen reinhart and kenneth rogoff reminded us after the  housing crisis but when comparing the  bitcoin boom with the current one there are lots of indications this one is differentthe previous one was characterized as a fomo event as hordes of retail investors fearful of being left behind rushed not only into bitcoin but into countless illconceived and often illegal icos it was a main street rallysadly in keeping with the “dumb money” depictions wall street traders often use of such hypechasing investors many bought high and sold low losing their shirts when the market collapsed in early  the winners at such times wall street will tell you are the “smart money” big guys who buy early and sell at the topthis feels much more like a wall street rally powerful institutions and bigname investors – from blackrock’s larry fink to bill miller of miller value partners and guggenheim partners’ scott minerd – have either invested in or at least talked about bitcoin’s potentialthere’s even onchain data to back up the thesis coin metrics’ measure of “whale” bitcoin addresses those holding more than  btc shows their number falling in  as little guys were buying but rising solidly as the price rose in  and into the new yearsource coin metricsof course the whales of  weren’t exactly wall streeters many were also retail investors in that case the “smart money” were those who grokked crypto and blockchain early on and knew that mania of that time was going too fast too earlytime will tell whether the wall street newcomers are the new smarts or whether they too have been playedthe conversation washington’s game plantwo other big bombshells items dropped out of washington during the breakon dec  the treasury department proposed that its financial crimes enforcement network fincen require crypto exchanges to store customer information – kycaml requirements – for transfers to unhosted or selfcustodied wallets of more than  and to file “currency transaction reports” for transactions aggregating more than  per dayon  the office of the comptroller of the currency announced it would allow banks to use public blockchainbased stablecoins to manage paymentsthe first was roundly condemned by the crypto community as an attack on privacy and innovation the second was hailed as a breakthrough for the crypto economybut were these seemingly contradictory initiatives uncoordinated a look at the twitter conversation suggests something more might be at playon dec  monetary economist and coindesk columnist jp koning made an observation others had missed the fincen proposal applies not just to regular cryptocurrency exchanges but also to any dealing in central bank digital currencieson jan  jeremy allaire ceo of circle the main issuer of the usdc stablecoin raved about the occ ruling’s power to transform global paymentsand policy  ceo tanvi ratna pointed out that bringing banks into the stablecoin business means more not less regulation and that regulation will have international reachhere’s where my mind went the fincen rule is as much about putting us financial surveillance capability onto exchanges of fiatdenominated digital currencies as it is about controlling bitcoin transactions the occ rule is perpetuating global demand for dollars because the mostsought after domination in stablecoins is usd as central bank digital currencies threaten to undermine the dollar’s dominancewhat crypto commentators view as a confounding good copbad cop routine against them might actually be a coordinated geopolitical play by washington together these rules could help the us maintain its singular power as the world’s reserve currency issuer to monitor and regulate global monetary movements even as china and other countries are trying to use digital currency technology to bypass the usregulated banking systemrelevant reads don’t forget ethereumparallel to our ongoing coverage of the wild bitcoin rally coindesk had a string of stories this past week that suggested ethereum is also in boom mode including renewed activity in ethereumbased decentralized finance
