what happenedthe price of bitcoin is volatile these days so i apologize if realtime prices differ significantly as i began this writing bitcoin nearly hit  per token  an alltime high  though its since cooled off a little still the price of bitcoin has more than doubled in just one month and its market capitalization is now over  billion yes billionwhen something this big goes up this fast its bound to attract attention as investors look for hidden ways to profit from the trend smallcap cryptocurrency stocks have been popular vehicles and many are on the rise again today consider these moves as of  pm estshares of marathon patent group nasdaqmarashares of riot blockchain nasdaqriotshares of bit digital nasdaqbtbtbut not all cryptoblockchain stocks were rising today for example xunlei limited nasdaqxnet stock and ebang international holdings nasdaqebon stock were down  and  respectively this is a big change from yesterday when xunlei was the big winner and bit digital was losingfinally making its debut in my crypto coverage is future fintech group nasdaqftft the stock is up  today but it had nearly doubled earlier in the session i believe future fintech has something to teach investors today note the company was formerly known as skypeople fruit juice inc and no im not kiddingso whatfuture fintech group is selfdescribed as a leading blockchain based ecommerce company and a financial technology service provider but it wasnt always until  its filings with the securities and exchange commission sec say it was engaged in the production and sales of fruit juice concentrates fruit juice beverages and other fruitrelated products in the peoples republic of china the juice business got too hard though high costs and environmental concerns were the cited reasons so the company decided to offer financial technology fintech services insteadyesterday future fintech issued a press release saying its successfully copyrighted  blockchain applications in china the company notes its commitment to blockchain because of its application in areas like recordkeeping and identity security among other things  and i agree thats the realworld possible value of blockchain technology tokenized assets such as bitcoin are just one possible application of the underlying techhowever investors interested in future fintech stock need to keep in mind that future is a very apt description of this company in the companys investor presentation it notes it generated  in revenue for the period ending june   not million  thousand and it also had less than  million on its balance sheet at the timefuture fintechs sec filings note a going concern meaning theres reasonable doubt for the longterm viability of this business perhaps its blockchain enhanced ecommerce sites are the future but for now this incorporatedinflorida but doingbusinessinchina fruit juice company turned fintech player needs cash it all sounds fishy to me dont be surprised if yesterdays good news regarding copyrights is followed up with a stock offering in the near future weve seen this movie before for example just a few days ago marathon raised  million by selling stocknow whatto me future fintech stock demonstrates just how hungry investors are for lifechanging stock market returns obscure smallcap stocks and penny stocks seem to be where people are looking the other cryptocurrency stocks mentioned in this article have all been bid up to lofty valuations with little fundamental support from their businesses sure miners like riot blockchain marathon and bit digital are better off as bitcoin rises but their valuations seem excessive at this pointif youve caught a five ten or even  in a matter of months i congratulate you i truly do but investors should always keep in mind the risk theyre taking on i would never risk my hardearned money on a fruit juice company trying to develop blockchain technology with less than  million in the bank i wouldnt risk it because i simply dont have to  lowrisk stocks with multibagger potential are all around the trick is finding them buying them and holding them for a really long timebitcoin could keep rising leading to further volatility in the stocks mentioned here and more in the days and weeks ahead as bit digital ebang and xunlei demonstrate you can never know for sure what will happen on a daytoday basis or when the music will ultimately end for that reason i strongly recommend investors use the majority of their investable money on a diversified portfolio of lowrisk highreward stocks
