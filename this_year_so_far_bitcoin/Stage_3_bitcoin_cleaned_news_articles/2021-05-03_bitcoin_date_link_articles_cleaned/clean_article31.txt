the limitations of physical reality are what make certain creations divine bitcoin reflects these properties in the digital realmif bitcoin were a mechanical watch the fee market not the free market would be the mechanism making everything tickthis is where everything starts and endsthis is where censorship resistance comes from and where the precious resource of block space gets priced into energy consumptionthe bitcoin fee market is the first manmade free market that ever existedin a free marketno third party can intervene in pricingno one can stop you from participatingparticipation is voluntarymost markets that emerge naturally are actually free it is the manmade ones that usually struggle with this propertyif you believe in the efficientmarket hypothesis then you know how important markets are and how they can help us to solve many problemsmost of the problems that humans have ever faced were coordination problems one obvious solution is to create a dominance hierarchy and elect a leader on top of it this worked wonderfully for a long time but as soon as our world became complex which it did because we made it so this started being less and less effectiveanother issue with such structures is that there is one single point of failure which makes them prone to corruption markets have the same issue if they are not built on trustless censorshipresistant infrastructurebitcoin  an analogtodigital converter functionthere are two worlds the realm of the tangible the real the world of thermodynamicsthe constraints of the “real world” are enforced by the laws of physics i can’t put my hand through a wall or if i do i need to push through the wall with greater force than the forces that hold the wall together and my bones need to be able to resist the force with which the wall pushes back at me if there is a coin on a table i can’t really copy it the best option is to obtain some materials and then spend some time and energy crafting a new identical coin as we evolved in this world we learned to use these constraints to our advantage the realm of the intangible the abstract the digital worldin the “digital world” the rules are different and almost nonexistent and that is great that’s why we created computers in the first place to escape the limitations of our physical realityhere you can listen to joe rogan at double speedhere you can send nude photos across the world limited only by the speed of light your nudes can then be copied with minimal effort and leaked on the internet just as easilymost of the time we don’t really need to have a solid connection between the two worlds as there are clear delimitations between them and expectations about their relationship it would be absurd to presume pamela anderson could jump out of the screen and shake your handwith money it’s different money is the most important coordination problem furthermore even though there are boundaries between the two worlds sometimes we need a bridge and a common contextbitcoin provides this context by enforcing the hard physical properties of the real world without losing the flexibility of the digital worldbitcoin converts analog energy into digital blocks and this is done through the mempoola look at the processan asic applicationspecific integrated circuit mining machine is connected to a power source through the wall socket electricity powers the machine this machine is incredibly dumb as it can do only one thing calculate as many  hashes as possible per unit of time as a result heat is dissipatedthis miner runs its own nodegoing through the pile of unconfirmed transactions “the mempool” with capitalistic desire the machines sort the transactions by who is willing to pay more per virtual byte of block space and then pick the ones that are the most expensive at this point they have a rough idea of what will go into the blockother data is also added to the block header a reference to the previous block a magic number that is really not that magic and some nonspecific data all the data is hashed by the machineall of this is done at an incredible speed about  tries per second per machine and the environment is very competitive as everyone wants to get the  btc given by the network for each block confirmation in addition to the juicy transaction fees they get to pocketthe winner is the first miner to find a hash with a value smaller than the current mining difficulty targetthis is what we call proof of workthis process transitions energy from a very hot mining farm in some part of the analog world where electricity is cheap to the digital blockchain this transition was very subtle somewhere in the mempool the two worlds mergedbitcoin and the creation of adamthe sistine chapel resembles bitcoin in many ways many people contributed to it it is wonderfully complex and regardless of the angle from which it is observed it can provide some amazing insight it has withstood the test of time and even though it has been updated the updates were always done in a backwardscompatible wayhowever for whatever reason most of the time when the sistine chapel is referenced one specific part of it gets more attention than others “the creation of adam”why is this is it just because adam’s creation was when we began our existence as a human speciesno it’s much more than that at this moment of inception we were not only touched by the divine but we were divine and we are made by it and of it and as such we inherit all the characteristics of god for a short moment we almost looked the sameever since god created humanity that small gap between the fingers grew larger and larger and the flow of energy was unidirectional from god to humans or as portrayed in the painting from right to leftthe reason why god is impressive is not just because he created things we do that every day it is because he created a world that has solid anchors—immovable objectsin reality there is no such thing as an immovable object there are only objects that require large amounts of energy for their momentum to be changed the same thing is true for bitcoin transactionsby inventing bitcoin we did the same thing that god did we created an immovable digital object and as a result we began closing that gap between ourselves and divinity we are getting closer and closer to our noble originson january   at  it all changed that’s when the first bitcoin block was mined that is when we become gods of the digital world that is when for the first time ever the flow of energy changed direction from left to rightbitcoin is the link between the two worlds chaos and order real and digital uncertain and certain unconfirmed and confirmedeven though we talk about these two different parts there is no clear separation between them we can’t really say where man ends and god begins as it is up to every man to draw that line for himself the truth is that there is no actual line only a gap that either becomes ever smaller or notin the same way there is also no such thing as the mempool there is only your mempool each node operator decides which unconfirmed transactions to store locally on their hard drive and propagate further through the network thus deciding the thickness of the line between unconfirmed and confirmedand it is here in the mempool where man becomes godthis is a guest post by
