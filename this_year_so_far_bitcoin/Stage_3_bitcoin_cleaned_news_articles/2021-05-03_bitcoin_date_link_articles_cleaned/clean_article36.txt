this article was originally published on etftrendscomeight years ago the first bitcoin etf application was filed then rejected then filed for again then rejected againover the years many many proposals have crossed the sec’s desk—at least twelve by our count and the regulator hasn’t approved any of them but this is the year say the foreveroptimists  is the year a bitcoin etf finally gets approvedwe have to admit something really does feel different now several cryptocurrency etfs have already launched abroad for starters including three bitcoin etfs in canada and as many ethereum funds brazil now has a bitcoin etf for trade tooin addition there’s been a changing of the guard at the sec former cftc head gary gensler—who until recently taught classes at mit on cryptocurrency—has been seated as sec chairman while noted bitcoin skeptic dalia blass exited the sec’s investment management division in januaryeven crypto skeptics are starting to sense that momentum is building a decision will be made—and soonwhere the bitcoin etf filings standcurrently eight applications sit before the sec all eight are variations of a physicallybacked etf – meaning the fund would hold bitcoins in cold storage somewhere much like the spdr gold trust gld holds gold bars in a vaultfour of the etfs have also had  forms filed on their behalf  are rule change proposals submitted by securities exchanges which would need official approval from the sec to change their listing rules to list and trade the bitcoin etfs in questionwhen a  is filed the sec has  days in which to weigh in or extend its period of review up to a maximum of  days historically the sec has pushed out these review periods as much as possible in fact the sec just extended the review period for the  cboe filed on behalf of the vaneck application the new decision date will be midjunethat said the  window is “binding” at least as much as anything at regulators hands ever is—and given that the vaneck  was filed on march  it means the sec has until the end of this year to make a call one way or the other on the firm’s proposal the clock is indeed tickingstory continueswhat’s inside each bitcoin etf filingwith so many proposals on the sec’s desk it’s easy to gloss over the details and assume each is pretty much the same as the others—especially since the chatter from experts and analysts is that the sec if and when it does approve an etf will approve more than one at onceyet these proposed etfs aren’t fungible each offers its own twist on the theme which we break down belowwhats inside the

vaneckfiled on this isn’t vaneck’s first crypto rodeo the issuer has submitted several bitcoin etf filings over the years including this one back in december  it also runs an institutionalonly bitcoin fund in partnership with solid xvaneck’s proposed etf—one of three that would list on the cboe exchange—would be selfindexed tracking the mvis® cryptocompare bitcoin benchmark rate which was developed by a vaneck affiliatethe benchmark is calculated daily using the onehour volumeweighted average bitcoin prices from the top five crypto exchanges out of a universe of  crypto exchanges worldwide those exchanges currently include bitstamp coinbase gemini itbit and kraken get used to those names you’re about to see a lot of them which exchanges’ prices are included is decided upon twice yearlybut what is “volumeweighted average pricing” essentially it’s a form of consolidated tape for bitcoin much in the same way major exchanges create a “ticker tape” for stock prices to accommodate for trades on not just the primary listing exchange but other trading venues as wellseveral other bitcoin etf proposals use this consolidated tape approach too including valkyrie wisdomtree kryptoin and galaxy the benefit is that consolidated tape reduces the idiosyncratic risk of market stress events or failure from any one exchange it also deters price collusion by forcing wouldbe malicious actors—or even the exchanges themselves—to succeed in their efforts across not just one exchange but five and over an extended period of time long enough to surely attract the notice of security experts and regulatorsvaneck’s spin on the consolidated tape is that its benchmark rate is calculated over the course of an hour using the median prices found on each exchange over twenty  intervals which are then averaged medians exclude outliers—another deterrent for price manipulation three minutes is a shorter interval than found in other proposals but a higher frequency of themthe index rate is then published once an hour throughout the trading dayunlike other etf proposals no custodian or other service provider is mentioned by name in the vaneck proposalthe sec is already formally reviewing the vaneck proposalfiled by valkyrie investmentsfiled on the valkyrie bitcoin fund introduces some tweaks to the vaneck approach it tracks a thirdparty index for starters the cme cf bitcoin reference rate which also serves as the basis for the bitcoin futures traded on the cme exchangethis rate is very similar to the volumeweighted average price approach in the mvis index and the five exchanges from which it aggregates trade flow are the same bitstamp coinbase gemini itbit and kraken the biggest difference is that the cme cf bitcoin reference rates calculation window is an hour’s worth of intervals broken into twelve  chunks instead of twenty  oneswhat really sets valkyrie’s proposal apart from all the others is its option for authorized participants aps to use cash in the creationredemption process while the trust itself only creates and redeems etf shares inkind aps now have the option to hand cash over to the fund’s administrator who will then buy or sell bitcoins via a contracted liquidity provider on the aps behalf it’s not quite cash createsredeems which are the norm in the canadian crypto etfs but it’s pretty close in practicethere are all sorts of trading reasons to favor using either cash or inkind createredeems—a thorny topic and one best left for another time but the basic gist is this inkind creationsredemptions will lead to low tracking error but leave open the potential for high trading premiums  discounts whereas cash creationsredemptions will narrow the possibility of premiums  discounts while possibly introducing slippage in navanother complicating factor is timing inkind createsredeems for the valkyrie fund will process the day the order is placed while cashish createsredeems will occur the day after that could lead to different trade execution prices for the two orders—which could be a significant disconnect given how quickly bitcoin prices have been known to move yet it could also protect the aps from big overnightovertheweekend price swingsthe valkyrie proposal also goes deeper into its specific security measures regarding how the bitcoins are stored bitcoins are stored both in a wallet account and a vault account and the private keys to the bitcoins are held in cold storage vaults around the world including the us switzerland south america and elsewhere custodian accounts may also be audited and inspected by both the trust and the sponsorvalkyrie lists coinbase as its custodian—coinbase being one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world and supplier of one of the five reference prices that go into calculating the etf’s index value the fund would trade on nysefiled by nydigfiled on the nydig bitcoin etf is one of two actively managed bitcoin etfs before the sec—though its prospectus doesn’t outright use the words “active management” only that the fund does not track a benchmark or index and it’s the only proposed etf that already has an initial ap lined up morgan stanleynydig’s proposed etf which would trade on nyse will value the bitcoin it holds according to gaap or generally accepted accounting principles the accounting standard used by the sec and therefore pretty much all fund accountants the managers’ version starts with first determining which bitcoin trading venues are active and orderly meaning they provide relevant reliable price and volume data that’s in turn defined as venues that trade in dollars have certain fraud protection programs in place and demonstrate market quality data integrity and regulatory compliancefrom there nydig values bitcoin using transactions in a designated “principal active market” generally whichever venue has the highest trading volume and activity likely an exchange according to the prospectus this principal market is decided upon quarterlyif reliable pricing info isn’t available though nydig reserves the option to rely on the subjective calls of a “fair valuation committee”—akin to the valuations that take place in bond etf landnydig plans to selfcustody the fund via a subsidiary no mention of vaults are made in the prospectus but nydig asset managers and trust officials can’t access the private keys from custody unlike other proposalsone last interesting note the prospectus is one of the few to mention a size for its creation unit which would be blocks of  shares that’s on the smaller side making it easier for aps to seize arbitrage opportunities by effecting a creationredemption on quick turnaround which in turn could lead to smaller premiums and discounts something that could be important given how quickly bitcoin prices can move and outside of normal trading hours at that that said smaller creation units can add frictional costs and are more of a pain for administrators and custodians to work with—and as a result those service providers may charge slightly higher fees to transactfiled by wisdomtreefiled on although at first glance the wisdomtree bitcoin trust sounds an awful lot like the valkyrie proposal it’s actually more similar to their already extant bitcoin etp trading in europe with just a few slight americanizationsthat product wisdomtree bitcoin has traded in europe since  and already has  million in assets under management on the swiss exchange it trades under the ticker “btcw”—the same ticker listed in the us proposalwisdomtree’s us proposed etf which would trade on the cboe would track the cf bitcoin us settlement price—which is almost exactly the same as the cme cf bitcoin reference rate used by the european etp and proposed in valkyrie’s application except that the cme version settles in london time whereas this rate is calculated as of eastern timeunlike the valkyrie proposal though wisdomtree’s proposed etf wouldn’t offer cashish creationredemptions creates and redeems in the wisdomtree proposal would only happen inkindno custodian has been named nor any mention of vaulting made—but given that coinbase is the custodian for the european version it might also be tasked with custodying this product as wellwisdomtree has clearly made a firmwide commitment to cryptotech the firm has filed for other cryptorelated products in the united states even a shortterm treasury fund based on the blockchain and of course it has already launched a bitcoin etp and ethereum etp in europe so it seems that wisdomtree isn’t vying to be a firstmover in the us so much as bring home the business it has already built overseaswill it succeed we’re about to find out the sec announced it had formally begun reviewing the wisdomtree proposal in aprilfiled by first trust and skybridgefiled on the first trust skybridge bitcoin etf trust is the second of two active etf proposals and the only one of the lot that would delegate the daytoday portfolio management of the fund to a subadvisor skybridge capitalskybridge is a hedge fund cofounded by anthony scaramucci a longtime hedge fund manager best known for his brief stint as the trump administration’s white house communications director in july however this isn’t scaramucci’s first foray into bitcoin like vaneck and wisdomtree skybridge runs other institutional crypto vehicles the firm also offers the skybridge bitcoin fund an institutionalonly fundlike the nydig proposed etf the first trustskybridge version would value bitcoin based on gaap in fact the two funds’ methodologies are very similar concerning how principal markets would be selected and revaluated and even their fallback fair valuation committeeswhere the two active etf proposals differ though is in the details about security skybridge’s prospectus digs far deeper into the security measures that would surround its bitcoins’ custody including geographically dispersed vaults where the private keys are held as with the valkyrie proposal some of the security measures mentioned in the prospectus include the fact that first trust employees must verify each transaction in the trust regular audits of the custodian’s holdings will be conducted and the aforementioned vaults are located deep underground to prevent seizure “from a government entity” prospectus’s language not oursin addition first trust and skybridge can access the bitcoins within the custodian’s account but the custodian can also restrict access should money laundering be suspectedno custodian has been named yet for the fund but bank of new york mellon has signed on as fund administrator and transfer agentfiled by fidelityfiled the fidelity bitcoin proposal is the most selfcontained application fidelity affiliates serve as fund sponsor custodian and index provider coin metrics serves as the calculation agent howeverthe wise origin bitcoin trust would track the fidelity bitcoin index which is a price return benchmark constructed using bitcoin feeds from eligible spot markets using yet another take on the volumeweighted median price methodology fidelity’s benchmark value would be calculated every  seconds based on rolling  increments the indexing algo would select the price associated with the median volumeeligible markets include all usbased digital exchanges eligibility is determined twice a year or more frequently during market disruptions current spot markets include—you guessed it—bitstamp coinbase gemini itbit and krakenfiled by kryptoin investment advisorsfiled on the sec is also now formally reviewing the kryptoin bitcoin etf trust application filed by kryptoin investment advisorslike the wisdomtree proposal the kryptoin etf would use the cf bitcoin us settlement price to determine the price of bitcoin in fact the two proposals are remarkably similar in methodology and security measuresthere are a few distinguishing characteristics though kryptoin’s prospectus is the only other proposal to list the size of its creation unit  shares the other’s is nydig’s with a unit size of  shares a  lot size is fairly standard for the etf world threading the needle between ease of use for aps and economies of scale for fund service providersfurthermore kryptoin’s is the only proposal where all intended service providers are listed by name its custodian would be gemini one of the exchanges whose prices feed into the benchmark rate while its transfer agent and administrator would be bank of ny mellonbut what sets kryptoin apart from the pack might be one of personnel the fund is led by jason toussaint former ceo of the world gold trust which sponsors the world’s biggest gold etf the spdr gold trust etf gldalthough the kryptoin bitcoin etf trust would be kryptoin’s first foray into the etf space this isn’t the firm’s first bitcoin etf filing the delawarebased investment advisor unsuccessfully filed for a fund in  not much has changed since that application although the fund now plans to list on cboe instead of nysefiled by galaxy digitalfiled on the final proposal in our review is the galaxy bitcoin etf which tracks the bloomberg galaxy bitcoin index—a cobranded index with bloomberg index services which serves as index providerthe benchmark yet another take on the “consolidated tape” is based on bitcoin prices aggregated from trading venues selected by the index provider for their pricing consistency frequency and market quality each day the index value is calculated over a  window right after the market close it is determined by calculating the median bidasks for bitcoin on the various venues then averaging them separately—then averaging those prices separatelythe difference for this take on consolidated tape is twofold first there’s no mention of volumeweighting in the pricing calculation which could skew the averages toward lessactive exchanges secondly the calculation window is only  minutes instead of an hour for other approaches including vaneck valkyrie wisdomtree kryptoin galaxy argues this length of time is long enough to make it difficult for collusion or manipulation to occur but it’s onefourth that proposed by the other approachesgalaxy’s proposal doesn’t cite a custodian by name but mentions that it has insurance and is chartered under ny banking lawbonus grayscale bitcoin trustwaiting in the wings and watching all this action is the grayscale bitcoin trust gbtc a closedend fund listed in europe grayscale has yet to file for its own etf and has remained tightlipped over its plans though its ceo has said he hopes to convert the fund to an etf as soon as possibleeagleeyed observers have noticed that the otherwise unremarkable clearshares piton intermediate fixed income etf recently changed its ticker to “btc” shortly after grayscale purchased a stake in clearshares etfs speculation has arisen that grayscale may be intending to convert that existing vehicle to a bitcoin fund in the same way that etfmg once converted a zombie latin american real estate fund to the world’s first marijuana etf but btc is a  act fund whereas a bitcoinholding etf would be neither a ’ act fund nor a commodity pool making a conversion like this unlikelywhat’s more likely is that gbtc realized the value of a juicy ticker and wanted to place dibs on this one by using the alreadylisted bond fund if and when the firm launches a us bitcoin product they’ll swap that ticker for the new fundfor more news information and strategy visit the crypto channelpopular articles and resources from etftrendscomread more at etftrendscom
