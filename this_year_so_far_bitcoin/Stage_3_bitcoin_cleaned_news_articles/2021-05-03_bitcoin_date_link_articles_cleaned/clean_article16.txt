for those following the cryptocurrency markets this weekend saw a big milestone as ethereum passed the  mark that still pales in comparison to bitcoin’s price tag of nearly  per coin at the time of this writing but it reinforces that there is growing interest in digital currencies among the general publicas such i thought it was worth resurfacing a small bit my colleague jenn marston wrote about bitcoin in her most recent restaurant tech newsletter over the weekendlandry’s a restaurant group that owns morton’s the steakhouse and bubba gump’s shrimp said in a recent interview that most of the company’s restaurant brands will start accepting bitcoin as payment in the coming months ceo tilman fertitta cited “the next  days” as a timeframecryptocurrencies actually have a long history with food pizza of all things was one of the first things “purchased” with bitcoin in  laszlo hanyecz traded  bitcoins with someone in exchange for them ordering him papa johnswe’ve seen crypto gain acceptance in fits and starts since then other restaurant chains have dabbled in accepting bitcoin though these are more oneoffs in various regions burger kings and pizza huts in venezuela kfc canada for a limited time some subway stores for example ramen vending machine yokai express accepted bitcoin at one pointbut we’re starting to see more acceptance of crypto from big established companies whole foods started accepting cryptocurrency back in  in april of this year you could start buying starbucks with bitcoin through the bakkt digital wallet chipotle used bitcoin as the backbone of a promotional stunt landry’s jumping into crypto is another big company pushing acceptance of bitcoin forwardthis is not a financial blog so this post should not be construed as advice but as more retail investors start buying crypto and well established companies like paypal and tesla begin to adopt bitcoin is there a bigger opportunity for food techat first adopting cryptocurrencies might seem like a natural fit for many of the companies we cover restaurants grocery retailers vending machine companies are all looking to streamline and automate much of their operations adding a universal digital currency available anywhere in the world could in theory could remove some friction from the transaction process and generate more salesbut there are definite pitfalls to adopting a cryptocurrency the whole process is still very complex not only are there are ton of cryptocurrencies with various utilities and values and there are some shady players out there just the act of buying and spending cryptocurrency is still complicated for the average consumer cryptocurrencies are also still volatile yes the overall trend for bitcoin over the past year has been a hockey stick but it still has wild valuation swings so the money you take in today could be worth a lot less an hour later and then there are tax and regulatory issues around crypto currencies that haven’t been fully figured out yetwe appear to be at some kind of public perception inflection point for cryptocurrencies while this bull run could be interrupted with a severe downturn there are more people than ever learning about buying and spending bitcoin that’s an opportunity for sure but one with no small amount of riskget the spoon in your inbox leave this field empty if youre human
