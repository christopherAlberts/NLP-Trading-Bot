while were all over here guffawing about dogecoin the actual crypto economy is taking offwhat do i mean take the rise of nonfungible tokens nfts these wouldnt be possible without the underlying rails they exist onin large part the ethereum network wait isnt ethereum a cryptocurrency yes and its at a record high again today but unlike bitcoin its also a software platform that can power other decentralized apps its kind of like bitcoin and the blockchain all in oneand these new tokens nfts are a total gamechanger i havent been this excited by something new on the scene since cloud computing a decade agoand look how much value the cloud has created in that relatively short period of time at least what  trillion just roughly using the market caps of microsoft google and amazonwhy the excitement because nfts like the cloud are a completely new process and payment schemeexcept while that one accrued to the big tech platforms this one accrues to the individual creator now sure big content creators like the nba and cnbc could also benefit from selling or owning their tokenized content but so can the little guys for instance people who just so happened to appear in content that went viral in recent years are now able to sell that content as tokensin one case earning over and there are all sorts of interesting things you can do with these blockchains to speak that werent possible before for instance you can build royalties into nfts so that each time theyre sold or transferred the original creator gets say a  commission or take a new coin that was just launchedsuperdoge sounds like a joke the worlds first superhero meme coin but guess what my friends charity has already collected over  from it how because this coin donates  of every transaction to charities including hersstill these new blockchains and crypto coins have a ways to go before theyre fully ready for widespread use and adoption each coin has its own approach to monetary policy for better or worse and the ethereum network apparently can run very high transaction costscritics argue it has antinetwork effects because the costs rise alongside price and usage as for security there are lingering concernsbut its important to point out that the value of any coin per se isnt whats most interesting about the world of crypto payments its the process innovation the rise of nfts the possibilities for replacing the current middlemen visa mastercard etc and it would be ludicrous not to expect more regulation especially as users offer innovative ways to use crypto securitization to avoid say higher capital gains tax ratesstill the real threat is not so much that governments crack down on crypto but that they appropriate it for themselvesusing digital dollars that track everything we do the way china has already begun to with digital yuan if thats the end game might as well enjoy this period of furious innovation while it lastssee you at  pmkellytwitter kellycnbcinstagram realkellyevans
