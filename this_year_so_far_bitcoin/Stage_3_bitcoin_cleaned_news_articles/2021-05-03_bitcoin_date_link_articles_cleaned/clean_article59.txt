on january   the first bitcoin mining operation went underway and a  btc reward was sent to address  although unconfirmed it most likely went to the mysterious satoshi nakamoto the inventor of bitcoin while no official transactions were recorded in the genesis block the embedded text “the times  chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” was a nod to the financial crisis of the time and a major motivator behind the decentralized currency’s inceptionfast forward to may  and those  bitcoins would collect you a cool  million usd however due to either a quirk in the system or an intentional implementation in the code the first  btc can’t be spent instead the first mining operation launched what would become global recognition of satoshi nakamoto’s vision of a decentralized currency and become a financial and technical force to be reckoned withtoday there are at least  million unique “miners” for bitcoin alone not to mention all the other crypto currencies in existence these miners are typically in the news for the wrong reasons expending terawatthours of energy annually  of the global electricity production for mining purposes gulping up gpus on launch day despite the silicon shortage and introducing novel yet somewhat controversial digital use cases such as cryptokitties and nonfungible tokens nftshow is this all happening what role is the miner playing and how might this change the landscape of computing in the futurebefore diving into the details of crypto currency mining it is worth understanding satoshi’s original vision regarding the motivation of a cryptocurrency and the use of the blockchain to address a set of very specific technical problemssatoshi’s visionaccording to the original whitepaper bitcoin is “a purely peertopeer version of electronic cash” aimed directly at modern financial institutions which act as middlemen for financial transactions the primary issue regarding modern financial institutions according to satoshi nakamoto is the inherent trust required for all transactionsthis trust could potentially lead to unidentifiable fraud by the middleman incur a high cost of mediation between customers or involve complexity even with small casual transactions as common as a wire transferto address these issues satoshi described a distributed ie not centralized electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust such a scheme he argued would make financial transactions immutable and “computationally impractical to reverse” and help protect against fraud all this while also getting rid of the need for a trusted third party during transactionswhile great in theory there was one minor technical challenge that needed ironing out namely in a public ledger anyone could claim a transaction even without the necessary funds who is there to arbitrate and assert that all transactions being performed are backed up by the appropriate amount of fundsfor example if alice has  at the beginning of the day she could promise bob charlie and david independently that she’d send them each  by the end of the day while alice could show them that she owns  and they’d all be content and agree to the transaction alice only has  thus if at the end of the day the public ledger which once finalized is set in stone so to speak includes  transactions initiated by alice for  the system would be broken and no one would want to use itwith a centralized system such as in modern day banks there would exist a single ledger that can validate how much money a certain individual has and thus it can guarantee that the customer cannot spend more than they own when talking about a decentralized peertopeer system however who’s there to stop a clever individual from spending their money multiple times quickly before getting caughtto address this potential issue crypto miners enter the playing field essentially miners play the role of the decentralized banker and will perform the required gruntwork to ensure that the system is functioning as expected without doublespending in return for their work they will be rewarded with some cryptocurrencyimage elena tarasovafor bitcoin specifically miners originally competed for a  btc reward approximately every  minutes today that reward has seen  “halvings” which reduced the reward from  btc down to  btc the next halving event is expected in  and miners will continue to experience halving events until all  million bitcoins are mined expected to be around as vitalik buterin the creator of ethereum puts it “the motivation behind halvings events is to keep inflation under control” once all bitcoins or any cryptocurrency are mined the network will continue to run on transaction feesbut why does all of this complexity even exist doublespending cryptographic proof of trust halvings a limited supply of crypto coins an immutable ledger and a distributed blockchain this all goes back to satoshi’s original paper which aimed to create an electronic cash system with proper checksandbalances while moving financial power from centralized forces to the distributed masseswhether that vision has been accomplished or hijacked is still up for debate however economics aside how did such a system force itself into existence from a simple  whitepaperlet’s take a technical deepdive into the inner workings of what computation miners are doing whether knowingly or inadvertently to enable the cryptocurrency revolutionbringing the crypto into cryptocurrencythe original bitcoin paper did not mention the word gpu at all in fact it focused entirely on cpus as the goto hardware for miners now even gpus might be outdated as hardcore miners probably need fpgas or asics to be competitive and strike gold to win the mining reward what is the major difference between these different architectures in the context of cryptocurrency mining the answer a high level of parallelism for the specific task of solving a difficult math problemthe job of the miner is twofold  to validate data blocks and add transactions to the blockchain only one miner can actually perform this operation at a time and add a new block thus in order to have the honor of arranging the next block of transactions the miner must  be the first to find the correct  hexadecimal number a “hash” that completes a numeric problemthe good news for the miner is that the math problem is actually not that difficult the goal is to find the right number traditionally called the “nonce” which when plugged into a cryptographic function  in the case of bitcoin will produce a number that is less than a defined value the bad news is that identifying the correct nonce is practically guesswork since it is a cryptographic function after allwhat miners are essentially doing with their massive computational processors and lots of electricity is guessing many nonce’s in parallel however the nonce itself is just a means to an end what the miner is really after is the correct hash value that is computed as a result of the correct nonceto make this more concrete take a look at the following block from the bitcoin blockchainyou’ll see many things in the block but if you look at the hash you’ll find the target number which miners are after one thing you may notice that stands out is the number of leading zeros in the hash this is not by accident and it in fact is what helps determine the difficulty of the mining algorithm more on this in a bitthe nonce that was used to generate block  was  or  in hexadecimal the nonce is used in conjunction with multiple other values including things such as the previous block hash the merkle root a timestamp etc such that the hash of these entities will together produce a value less than a specific target of to understand the computational complexity of this cryptographic function here is a handy calculator which can be used to compute the  of an arbitrary messagenow imagine the “message” is a summary of multiple transactions such as alice sent bob  and various metadate previous blocks hash merkle root timestamp etc and the nonce the challenge is to identify the correct nonce which when included as part of the message will produce an output with  leading zerosyou’ll notice that while playing with this calculator that this is practically “random” and will require an extremely large number of guesses to land any set of leading zeros let alone at least  in fact at a high level by changing the number of leading zeros you can increase the difficulty involved with mining the block and hence keep the target of “ min per block” in check especially as more miners enter the fieldyou’ll also see in block  that the mining reward was  btc plus an additional fee reward of approximately  btc at the time of this writing  is the standard bitcoin reward which will eventually halve a few more times until all btc are mined after all btc are mined the network will run exclusively on transaction fees giving miners a fraction of the transactions in the block for their workthis system of mining is typically called a “proofofwork” pow the idea actually goes back to the concept of trust rather than trusting a centralized entity to perform all transactions and taking their word as “proof” that nothing malicious transpired the pow system demands to know that the miner put in the right amount of work as a trustworthiness metric since cryptographic functions require a ton of work to be “solved” by identifying the correct nonce the miner effectively proved that they did the necessary computational work behind the scenesother systems include proofofstake which ethereum will be migrating to eventually as  which actually changes the role of the miner to be proportional to the number of coins heldthe cryptographic algorithm is at the core of cryptocurrency there are certain attributes that make cryptographic algorithms ideal for the “math problem” miners are solving includingthey are not practical to compute backwards starting from the target value and obtaining the nonceit requires a lot of guesswork to compute in the forward directionthe mining difficulty can be adjusted to make it more difficult to guess as more miners enter the playing field this helps make the network more secure against attacksthe blockchain is immutable and attempting to chain any previous transaction would actually break all following transactions mathematically isn’t the only mining algorithm used for cryptocurrencies as mentioned earlier one of the pitfalls of bitcoin mining is that most miners now use asics which are specialized hardware that can be solely designed to be efficient at  computations ethereum for example uses the daggerhashimoto algorithm which is aimed to be asicresistant by design monero bytecoin and dashcoin all use the cryptonight algorithm which is also considered asicresistant and uses blockchain obfuscation for better privacy the landscape grows almost exponentially from there in terms of cryptocoin objective mining algorithm and various other technical detailsthe mining landscape philosophical and technical differencesalthough bitcoin started the mining craze of the  century today we find more than  different types of cryptocurrencies in the wild since it is relatively easy to create a new cryptocurrency many are indeed scams and it is critical to do your research before either buying or mining a coin but why are there so many crypto currencies in the first placebehind every new coin is a developer or multiple developers and this can lead to different personal or financial agendas for example many cryptocoins came to surface after asics entered the mining field in order to return the distributed nature of the blockchain to the masses rather than few entities with enough capital to throw at asic farmsothers like litecoin actually differed very little from previous coins and sought to address a more fundamental technical issue in the case of litecoin it was a spinoff of bitcoin which decreased the block generation time to  minutes in order to make it more liquid for transactions to that end it also increased the total number of coins from  million to  million among other technical changesas the crypto community grew so did opinions on what the ideal cryptocurrency should be should btc continue to be based on satoshi’s original ideas and implementation in  or should it adapt to the times the latter ended up resulting in a fork of bitcoin into bitcoin cash which changed the blockchain from having  mb block sizes to a maximum of  mb block sizes essentially this allows more transactions to fit into each block of the blockchainwhen  old vitalik buterin couldn’t convince bitcoin developers to adopt a programmable cryptocurrency into the bitcoin blockchain he set about making his own now the ethereum network is the  largest cryptocurrency by market size and also has a valuable blockchain feature namely smart contracts or programmable money later fabian vogelsteller an ethereum developer created the  standard allowing practically anyone to make a cryptocurrency “token” which runs on top of the ethereum blockchain led to an influx of many new cryptocurrencies as initial coin offerings ico depending on who you ask icos are either largely scams with very few practical currencies or generally practical with scamcoins far and wide in between regardless  led to the creation of at least  tokenbased projects on the ethereum main network including tether binance coin wrapped bitcoin wbtc and usd coin the future of ethereum is now transitioning into a proofofstake pos system as directed by a consortium of academic and financial minds at the enterprise ethereum allianceshould you be a minerbefore diving into the mining world there are many questions you ought to ask yourself it might be quite expensive to even get into the game given a worldwide shortage of gpus amid supplychain issues but even if you have a spare gpu laying around other questions such as electricity cost can come into play mining is an extremely computationally expensive process and would practically max out any cpu or gputhere are also cryptocurrency choices to make bitcoin for example is very hard to mine as an individual today due to the widespread use of asic miners other coins such as ethereum and monero might only be profitable if joining a pool of miners and sharing mining power the result is a shared profit which although smaller is more likely to occur given the combined hashing rate of a mining poolto make a decision you should consider many of the following and perhaps use a calculatorhash rate of your rigblock rewardcurrent mining difficultyelectricity costpower consumption wmining pool feescryptocurrency pricedifficulty increase rate of minersthe last two points are often the most variable and are the hardest to predict then again if profit is secondary and you are a believer in satoshi’s vision of a truly distributed peertopeer cash system perhaps identifying the right coin and mining it is your calling regardless it always makes sense to understand the technical details and differences of cryptocurrencies in order to make an informed judgement of the currency being invested inmasthead credit timofei rostilov
