generally hear about and buy is bitcoin before learning about other assets and allocating across the space we think the same learning curve is playing out with institutional investors right now where the crypto narrative is shifting from bitcoin to ethereum and other segments like defi and web  apps”grider says that one reason fundstrat is bullish on ethereum is due to “the large amounts of development happening there and the resulting economic activity in its digital economy”the way fundstrat arrived at a  price target is by valuing ethereum “on a revenue multiple basis”fundstrat says that “given the correspondingly strong improvement in fundamentals” ethereum “still looks as cheap as it did three months ago at half the price”as for bitcoin grider says that fundstrat is maintaining its  price target for bitcoin given that they “believe the bull market remains intact” according to him although the bitcoin price recently fell below its  moving average this is nothing to worry about since it has happened several times in previous bull market cycles and it’s the  moving average that bitcoin has “historically maintained during prior bull runs”finally it is worth pointing out that fundstrat remains “bullish not just on bitcoin and ethereum but on the entire crypto space” and still believes that the total crypto market is on its way to a  trillion market capon friday april
