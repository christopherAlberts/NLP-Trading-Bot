in to help get cash to the seven million american households without bank accounts as paypal worked to accommodate the unbanked schulman felt a sense of urgency“you were seeing the acceleration of trends that would have typically taken maybe three to five years happening in three to five months” says schulman  “i thought it was important that paypal help shape what that future could look like and not react to it”paypal’s existing technology integrated with traditional banks was clunky and slow taking as long as ten days to complete a transaction first it relied on a georgiabased startup called ingo money to upload and verify the images of stimulus checks and then a bank in georgia to clear and settle them five to ten days later the cash showed up in an account at paypal or its millennialfriendly subsidiary venmo if the customer is willing to pay a  percent fee the cash is credited in minutes but behind the scenes the bank assumes the risk if the check doesn’t clearschulman who was already familiar with blockchain the technology underlying bitcoin knew there was a better way blockchain technology could easily—and much more quickly— distribute cryptocurrencies like bitcoin directly into electronic wallets sure the unbanked would need an internet connection to spend it—or turn it back into plain old greenbacks—but that was also true of paypal’s current solutionschulman knew that the federal government—the supplier of stimulus payments—could soon become his competition digital currencies issued directly by central banks socalled cbdcs were on the horizon their development would enable governments to send payments directly to citizens according to the bank for international settlements  percent of central banks were already exploring the new

paypal will expand its cryptocurrency service to venmo’s  million customers “it’s not just an investment instrument” he adds “it’s a way that we will enable commerce”another bitcoin adopter jolted into action by the pandemic is  million sales business intelligence software company microstrategy michael saylor the  chief executive of the publicly traded company spent  billion buying bitcoin in  borrowing  million of it the digi­tal asset currently worth  billion sits on the tysons corner virginia–based company’s balance sheet alongside more mundane stores of value like treasury bills saylor outspoken and controversial since he briefly became a multibillionaire during the first internet bubble in  sees it as a hedge against the federal government’s easymoney policy which he figures is devaluing the dollar at a rate of  percent per year“as the energy is sucked out of the dollar the currency’s value is collapsing” saylor says “that means that every stock bond piece of real estate or other asset that rests on the foundation of fiat currency is sagging” with microstrategy demonstrably unable to produce organic growth that measures up to the likes of amazon or netflix saylor effectively turned his enterprise software company into a leveraged bitcoin etf its stock is up by  percent in  months by forbes’s count at least  other publicly traded companies have bitcoin on their balance sheetsmost companies on the blockchain  however are not bitcoin speculators but rather are looking to employ the technology underlying the cryptocurrency in innovative ways north carolina–based honeywell for instance is using blockchain to connect buyers and sellers of used aviation parts so far  suppliers including boeing and lufthansa have signed up and in  some  million in parts changed hands that’s small potatoes for the  billion sales giant but honeywell executives hope that their proprietary platform could one day move the entire industry for secondhand parts

cona services a newcomer to the blockchain  provides technology services to the  largest cocacola bottling companies in north america prior to its adoption of blockchain technology orders and

unexpected costs using its new encrypted system order confirmations proof of shipment and proof of receipt are added to the blockchain in real timeamong the most frequently used blockchains on our list this year are four standouts twentyfive companies used one of the free versions of software provided by hyperledger the blockchain branch of the nonprofit linux foundation twentytwo used ethereum the blockchain that runs the  billion ether cryptocurrency nine used quorum an enterprise version of ethereum developed by jp­morgan and sold to new york blockchain startup consensys and six used corda developed by  a blockchain startup that has raised  million in venture capital then there’s bitcoin of course which is being used by no fewer than  members of our listaccording to the gartner group there were more than  corporate blockchain projects underway in america as of november  most are earlystage and experimental but  percent are either in production or will be soon forrester research is even more optimistic predicting that as many as  percent of active blockchain projects will be ready for customer use this yearone significant trend amid the excitement over digital assets has been a flood of major companies getting into cryptocurrency custody services it’s telling for example that micro­strategy’s saylor and other institutional investors won’t reveal how they store their bitcoin this difficult task—bitcoins worth billions have gone missing over the years—has long been a barrier to institutional adoption there are other problems besides fraud and theft if the owner of a bank account forgets her password the bank simply resets it with bitcoin for which banks aren’t necessary losing the password called a private key is like losing the asset itself with no recovery possiblein july the office of the comptroller of the currency published a letter stating that banks would now be permitted to provide custody services for crypto assets it’s no surprise that financial institutions preparing for a day when digital asset ownership is common are rushing into the cryptocustody business no fewer than six institutions including spanish bank bbva dutch bank ing and swiss securities firm six are now cryptocustodians in december hedge fund one river disclosed that it was using northern trust’s custody services to manage  million worth of cryptocurrency and was looking to increase the amount to  billion that same month northern trust invested in londonbased cryptocurrency custodian startup zodia custodyin many ways companies like northern trust and fidelity which is also offering cryptocustody services are perfectly positioned to build a bridge to a regulated digital asset reality northern trust has already partnered with a singapore fintech startup named bondevalue to act as servicing and custody agent in a business that uses blockchain technology to carve up and sell fractional interests in corporate bonds in august the partnership executed the world’s first blockchainbased bond trade an  sliver of a  million  percent coupon bond originally issued by singapore agriculture giant olam the trade which normally takes two days to settle required just seconds“we’re going to continue to invest in digital asset programmes across the landscape” says justin chapman an executive vice president at northern trust “we think the technology is there the understanding is there clients are ready”
