investors have received a stark warning about these companies images gettyone of australia’s greatest stock market players is worried about bitcoin and stocks like tesla and thinks they have “dotcom bust” written all over themthe guy in question is hamish douglas cofounder of magellan financial group which has been a pretty good stock market performer since heres what he has to saymagellan financial group mfgsource aufinanceyahoocoma ride up from a  cents share price to  nowadays with an alltime high of around  shows magellan has been a top class company to invest in and it indicates that hamish should be listened to when he’s a little worried about excessive valuations of the likes of tesla and bitcoinof course he could be wrong for a time before he’s proved right but there’s an important lesson or two from his warnings for both inexperienced and experienced stock market playersbefore i share these lessons don’t think hamish and his magellan team are antitech stocks as the company’s biggest holding is microsoft  per cent followed by amazon  per cent and then google alphabet  per cent but it worries about nonprofit makers with crazy valuationsby implication he’s saying that when he invests in starbucks that has been opening  plus stores a year in china and made profit of  billion last year despite the pandemic lockdowns that’s a company he wants to risk his clients’ money in that’s what you call investing going long bitcoin and tesla is speculation and their share prices could blow up any time soon or later which could cause a  per cent correction to the overall market that’s not my belief but it is hamish’s though he’s not expecting it soonthat said he doesn’t rule out a surprise trigger that could spook the stock market and cause a mad rush for the exits on wall street and global share marketsa guy like hamish sticks with great stocks but when he gets worried he builds up his cash compared to share holdings so if there’s a share market correction a drop of  per cent or more he has dough to buy great companies such as microsoft and starbucks at marketscared pricesstory continuesas i said that’s investing and contrasts mightily with those speculative plays that can be rewarding short term but can be moneykilling in the long termand if you don’t believe me look at these charts of bitcoin and teslabitcoinsource providedin  bitcoin hit  by early  it was  there are experts tipping it goes to  this year but that’s a guess that only speculators should believeand then there’s tesla which is a great car company but is it really more valuable than toyota volkswagen and general motorsearly this year the share prices of these companies gave us their market capitalisation tesla was valued at  billion toyota us  billion volkswagen  billion and gm  billionteslasource providedin january tesla was a  stock but by march it was a  stock now it’s  that’s the price movement of a very risky stock despite the fact i called it a good buy for speculators especially if it went to it didn’t go to  so i missed out on the recent rise but if i hadn’t i’d be a seller now i’d keep some cash for a sell off and buy rock solid companies like microsoft if stock prices went for a divei’ll say it again that’s investingfollow yahoo finance on facebook linkedin instagram and twitter and subscribe to the free fully briefed daily newsletter
