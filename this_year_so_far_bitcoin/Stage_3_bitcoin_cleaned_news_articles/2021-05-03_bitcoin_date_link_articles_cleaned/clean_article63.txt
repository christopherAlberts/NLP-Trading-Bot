the people wanted tokens and nfts and they got tokens and nfts then the people wanted an exchange for tokens and they got the relayx decentralized exchange rex as well as bitcointokenexchangenow people want an open nft marketplace similar to those that can be found on ethereum and we got the recently launched blockpress–the easiest way to create nfts and subsequently sell buy and auction them all in one easy to use platformbefore attila aros created blockpress creating digital art nfts on bitcoin wasn’t exactly easy although some nft platforms and marketplaces predated blockpress none of those platforms were as easy to use as blockpress which allows you to create digital art collectibles by simply dragging and dropping your desired image onto the platform entering the wallet address that will be designated as the owner of the nft and then swiping a button for payment and to publish to chain“the original vision of blockpress back in  was to create a way for creators artists and users to be able to earn bitcoin by posting unique content” said aros“only recently is it now possible to create fully userowned digital assets and communities by using the scripting capabilities of bitcoin svtaking the original vision and combining it with the powers of bitcoin sv makes it easy to create a fully onchain marketplace for nonfungible tokens nfts enabling anyone to create unique works of art software and media to earn bitcoinusing nfts for digital assets and collectibles is just the beginning we plan to turn everything into a token and allow users to build and grow their own communities which themselves are tradeable nfts”digital art collectibles are just the tip of the iceberg aros envisions a world where tokens and nfts are used for much more than collecting and reselling what makes blockpress the tool to make a world like that possible is that blockpress is the first nft marketplace that leverages the bitcoin blockchain in a way that aros says makes the most of bitcoin’s layer  scripting capabilities“blockpress is the first  onchain layer  nft solution in the world on any blockchain what this means is that all of the data is stored fully onchain forever and the logic is governed onchain without external programming languages by doing it this way we have an extremely efficient and flexible smart contract that frees the developers and wallets to build on top without being forced into a specific way of doing things”what makes this possible is super asset  the token protocol that blockpress utilizes“blockpress uses a custom layer  token protocol called superasset the key difference is that superasset is a pure onchain solution and does not impose a requirement on running a specific programming language except bitcoin script” said aros“the plan is to support major token standards we already have plans to support both superasset and run we believe the layer  technique of superasset can be used directly in run so we can have the perfect hybrid solutionsuperassets are like building blocks at the base layer little structure and extremely efficient run is a comprehensive computing runtime and architecture with a sophisticated state commitment scheme we believe both approaches will play together very well and address the complete range of needs for modern smart contract engineers”what’s next for blockpressblockpress is in its very early stages and its users only have access to a limited number of features while it is being battletested however more features will be available to blockpress users in the near future“we will add the ability to sell buy and auction digital assets soon to get to market we wanted to “soft launch” and work out some of the bugs and get some feedback before enabling the additional features” said aros“we are targeting about a week of beta to enable the ability to buy and sell whereas auctions will come a few weeks later we will be officially live by june  but you will see rapid advancements this month as we get ready to enable buying and selling of digital assets”the innovations that have taken place in bitcoin over the past few months as well as the scripting capabilities of bitcoin and the market demand for nfts created the perfect storm to spawn a tool like blockpresspeople have been asking for a platform that allows them to easily create nfts and an openmarketplace where they could subsequently be sold and traded for quite some time and now they have a few different options when it comes to using a platform that can accomplish these goalsas attila aros said before digital art collectibles are just the beginning what’s more interesting is what individuals businesses and builders will do now that they have a tool that allows them to easily create and utilize nftsuse blockpress and become blockpress compatibleinterested in using blockpress you can find all the information you need to create your very first nft via blockpress on
