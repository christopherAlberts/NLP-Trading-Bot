watch this episode on youtubelisten to this episodefor this episode of bitcoin magazine’s “meet the taco plebs” i was joined by thomas jestopher jestopherbtc a lightning network enthusiast and cohost of “bitcoin kindergarten”we kicked off this interview with jestopher sharing his rabbit hole story discussing his first attempt to buy bitcoin from mt gox in  in order to buy bitcoin from there you had to wire money to the exchange in japan and his bank actually blocked his transaction forcing him to look for other avenues to acquire btcusing faucets jestopher was able to stack some sats in trade for his time watching ads on websites he did this for a while but didn’t make his first actual purchase until the bull run in  at the time he worked in a call center where he saw just how corrupt and unfair banks are to their customers this in addition to the price catching his attention caused him to fall deep down the rabbit holejestopher shared his thoughts on how bitcoin inspires innovation for builders and entrepreneurs to flourish since the bitcoin protocol does not change and upgrades only happen so often people now have a solid base layer that they know will always be there and they know nothing will change on them in a negative way this gives builders comfort knowing that they’re building on a solid foundationjestopher was one of the many people who got inspired to build on bitcoin and saw massive potential in the lightning network we discussed the entrepreneurial opportunities that pop up thanks to lightning and how people can become more independent from taking tips on the second layer solution then he shared his thoughts on using the lightning network on top of bitcoin as a medium of exchangebelow are some of jestopher’s most interesting thoughts shared during the interview and be sure to check out the full episode for morehow did you find bitcoin and fall down the rabbit holei first attempted to buy bitcoin from mt gox in early  and my bank rejected the transaction i resolved to visit a series of faucets and watched countless hours of ads to walk away with about a dollar’s worth of bitcoin naturally i deposited into one of the many gambling websites and promptly lost about all of itmy next interaction with bitcoin happened in the  run up when my reddit feed was dominated by bollywood dancing gifs which i almost filtered out but instead i made possibly the best decision of my life and decided to actually buy some bitcoin just a small fractioni had previously worked in a call center that provided information on class action lawsuits most of the lawsuits that i was providing information on involved banks that were using practices that benefitted the corporation at the expense of their customers for example a lot of banks chose to reorganize their customers’ transactions in highest to lowest dollar order in effect that meant that whenever a customer ran out of funds the customers would get charged more overdraft fees than if the bank never reorganized transactions for most banks i encountered an overdraft fee was  which is already a lot to charge someone that literally has no money i remember thinking that the decision to reorder transactions to generate more overdraft fees from customers who were broke was a shameful way for a bank to increase revenue which customer would ever vote for that type of policyonce i had actually bought bitcoin i started listening to “the internet of money” andreas antonopoulos’s book and the combination of concepts behind bitcoin resonated with me so deeply between the disruptive power of technology and the humanitarian benefits derived from a completely optin protocol immune to the policy decisions of banks and corporations this technology is both massively disruptive and gives me more hope for humanity than anything else in the worldhow has bitcoin changed your lifebitcoin has made me far more frugal less political more privacy conscious more technologyfocused and way more obnoxious if you somehow still don’t own bitcoinone phrase that came to mind early in my bitcoin journey was “never before has greed tempted me to live a very simple life” as soon as i said it in a bitcoin chat another bitcoiner responded with a bright orange image with my freshlyquoted words strewn across it it was true then and it’s still true today where i feel inclined to rid myself of possessions because all these consumer things are just depreciating assets in bitcoin terms i feel like mainstream environmentalists have been missing how positively the earth can benefit from converting consumers into longterm saverswhat is the most amazing thing about bitcoin to youthe most amazing thing about bitcoin is that it inspires innovation while bitcoin seems intimidating at first the fact that it is so resistant to change makes it a solid platform to build on builders don’t have to keep up on all the latest developments or worry about the next president removing your favorite feature bitcoin will stay true to its roots which makes it easier to launch a successful business and to create specialized toolsit seems impossible to find a place to specialize outside of bitcoin because the world is in a state of flux between disasters both natural and political that make it difficult to find your niche bitcoin makes it easy to specialize and i’ve found my place in the lightning routing community where we’re trying out the latest tools and gathering feedback to make really smooth user experiences on lightningwhat are you most looking forward to in the bitcoin spacei’m most looking forward to watching the taproot activation play out which will give me some good clues about whether or not other protocol changes that specifically benefit lightning will get implementedi’m also looking forward to data markets emerging where privacy on lightning will be less of a guarantee and more of a market routing nodes have information on individual payments which is valuable data for surveillance companies as well as other routing nodes searching for where to provide liquidity if someone wants to track an individual payment they’ll have to pay to get that data and the market will find an equilibrium between individual privacy and network efficiencywhat is your price prediction for the end of  and the end of i’m a terrible trader which is the primary reason i only hodl bitcoin but i’d guess that the end of  will be in a mania phase and we’ll see bitcoin over  the end of  should see bitcoin approaching the  million level as the fiat experiment comes to an end
