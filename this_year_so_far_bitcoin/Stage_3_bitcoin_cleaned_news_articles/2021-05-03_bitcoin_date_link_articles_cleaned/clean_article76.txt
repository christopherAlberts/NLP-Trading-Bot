some  of the american public owns some form of cryptocurrency – and a large part of that group jumped on the bandwagon in the last two years the digital currencies – bitcoin is the most famous but there are scores of others – offer users a distinct set of advantages based on their blockchain technology first the crypto coins are secure – as a digital technology blockchain is notoriously difficult to break second the coins have the chief attribute of any store of value scarcity there is a mathematical limit to how many bitcoin for example will ever exist – and that limit gives them their value people want a secure online currency are willing to pay for it and the relatively scarce compared to traditional fiat currencies crypto coins offer both attributes the result in recent years has been a boom as investors have started looking seriously at the crypto sectorof course any digital currency is going to need a range of services to be usable financial companies to back it and payment servers to handle transactions to name just two other companies and major business figures – elon musk comes readily to mind – will invest heavily in it all of this creates a landscape in
