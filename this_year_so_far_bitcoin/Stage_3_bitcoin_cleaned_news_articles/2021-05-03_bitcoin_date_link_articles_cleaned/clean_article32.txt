the rules of investing seem simple diversify your portfolio and focus on the long term that’s until you see some guy on reddit get rich overnight betting on cryptocurrencyerik finman became a millionaire after investing  in bitcoin when he was  glauber contessoto invested all his savings in dogecoin on feb  and by midapril his investment was worth more than  million he told cnbc make it he wasn’t alone when dogecoin’s price surged  in a week last month owners took to twitter and reddit to share that they had made thousands of dollarsso you may be seriously regretting not throwing some dollars into one of these cryptocurrencies but don’t be too hard on yourselfpicking the right cryptocurrency — and getting rich off of it — is a lot harder than it looks here’s whythere are tons of cryptocurrenciesby now you know the original cryptocurrency bitcoin whose  trillionplus market value accounts for about half of all money invested in cryptocurrency you may have also heard of ethereum and litecoin which have gone more mainstream now that you can buy and sell them as easily as sending your friend a venmo request for dinnerbut there are a ton of other cryptocurrencies — over  of them according to coinmarketcapcom — that you likely haven’t heard of and more being mined every dayyou had to be pretty lucky or maybe be able to predict the future to have chosen dogecoin years ago over say feathercoin as financial writer john paul koning points out feathercoin was a much more serious cryptocurrency — created with the intention of mass adoption as opposed to as a joke — that is currently valued at around  million while the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin is worth  billionsure if a group of people are randomly flipping coins a few of them are going to flip ten heads in a row says chris kuiper vice president of equity research at cfra research similarly if you have a whole bunch of people on robinhood trying to day trade altcoins some of them will do really wellads by

 apy trade currencies or borrow money without selling your assets start investing in crypto advertisementthe timing has to be just righttiming when a certain coin will surge is at best very hard and at worst impossible investors may be rushing to buy or sell because of events you can’t predict like a tip on reddit or because tesla says it’s doing so“all of a sudden you have that really dangerous fear of missing out for investors” says megan horneman director of portfolio strategy at verdence capital advisors “everybody buys it it rises significantly — until the next hot topic comes out”it’s like the dotcom bubble she adds the internet came out investors bought anything that had a dotcom at the end of their name but with cryptocurrency it’s even more dangerous because instead of buying companies with earnings you’re basically buying somebody’s idea — there is no way to fundamentally value the currenciesdogecoin has built a strong community over the years and its lightheartedness made it the perfect fit for the meme stock movement that earlier this year sent gamestop’s stock soaring says richard smith the ceo of the foundation for the study of cycles and a financial cycles expert“but i don’t think that’s something that you could have predicted or that we can be confident is going to continue” he addsremember cryptocurrency doesn’t just go up so not only do you need to know when a cryptocurrency is going to catch fire but you also need to buy it on its way up if you had bought  worth of bitcoin in  before its price skyrocketed you could have made over  when it reached a peak later that year but if you bought the same  worth at the peak and sold a year later you’d have lost more than  — almost your entire investmentso what about those people who do get the timing rightjust because they did it once doesn’t mean they can do it again those investors who roll the dice and get lucky buying at the bottom and selling at the top — and it is purely luck according to horneman — could be in even more danger as they move on to other speculative investments“they’re going to go into their entire investment philosophy thinking ‘this is how i can make money it’s that easy’” horneman says “it’s not”ads by money we may be compensated if you click this ad ad investing made easy  get mobile access to the markets and choose how much you want to invest robinhood allows you to invest commissionfree in individual companies or bundles of investments etfs begin investingthere’s no guaranteed futureeven if you pick the right cryptocurrency buy at the “right” time and plan on getting rich over the long term that purchase doesn’t come with the promise that the coins are going to be around forevereven bitcoin which is considered the most legitimate cryptocurrency could potentially be banned or at least highly regulated treasury secretary janet yellen said earlier this year that the us government may need to “curtail” the use of bitcoin adding that it’s mainly used for “illicit financing”“investments like this are just simply running on speculation — any headlines of regulation will take the wind out of their sail” horneman says “it will cause significant volatility across the board”hard as it is to believe right now investors could also lose interest in cryptocurrency think of aol which was once hailed as the king of media but has since become something of a relic and there are plenty of other examples too from betamax to minicomputershow to responsibly invest in cryptoif you feel you need to scratch the crypto itch you can make room for it in your portfolio alongside your stocks and bondsbitcoin’s performance doesn’t appear to be directly correlated to stocks and it’s helpful to have some assets do well while others tank but as money has previously reported the correlation rises during “bad times” so you need to be careful about overexposing your portfolio to cryptocurrencyexperts say you can allocate up to  of
