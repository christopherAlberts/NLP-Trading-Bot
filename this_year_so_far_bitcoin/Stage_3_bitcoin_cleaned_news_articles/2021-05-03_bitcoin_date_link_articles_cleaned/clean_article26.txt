lately it seems everyone has an opinion on bitcoin cryptobtc at the berkshire hathaway nysebrkanysebrkb annual meeting this weekend charlie munger offered his to the surprise of no one it was salty and pulled no punches the  billionaire and partner to warren buffett gave a stark assessmenti dont welcome a currency thats so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth nor do i like just shuffling out of your extra billions of billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air i think i should say modestly that the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilizationits not surprising someone who was a child during the great depression and nearly  by the time the us abandoned the gold standard isnt excited about digital currency rather than chalk it up to a generational misunderstanding lets look at three things that support mungers skepticism its a speculative assetthe original design of bitcoin limited the amount that could ever be created the fixed supply changes the way people use it  or dont use it the focus on a set amount of coins has turned it into a speculative asset people are derided for not holding on or in bitcoin parlance hodling terms like diamond hands have become synonymous with someone who isnt selling his or her bitcoin investment not only are those folks not selling they arent using it as a currency either instead theyre planning to sell it to someone else in the distant future for more than they paid that is the very definition of speculationfor those wondering isnt that exactly why people hold stocks the answer is yes and no stock investors may want to sell shares at a later date for a higher price but those shares are a claim on actual cash flows and dividends its similar to real estate where the value is theoretically derived from the propertys ability to produce rent bitcoin has no such cashgenerating potential its less secure than the current systemone thing bitcoin proponents laud is its security without the digital key a criminal cant access funds held in bitcoin one of mungers favorite mental models is to invert a problem  to think about it both forward and backward in this case if one digital key secures all your bitcoin the opposite is also true all your bitcoin can be stolen or lost with one digital keyearly bitcoin platform mt gox lost  coins after being hacked in  it declared bankruptcy in  freezing hundreds of thousands more coins there have been numerous stories of holders who lost hundreds of millions of dollars by accidentally throwing away the hard drive with their digital key or forgetting their passwordsin traditional banking there is no one password that gives people access to all of their funds in addition artificial intelligence and twofactor authentication make stealing a password harder and harder the digital key may be a single point of access but that also makes it a single point of failure thats something designers in all fields physical and digital are taught to avoid the beginning of the endthe argument has been made that if someone wanted to guarantee humans would destroy the earth the best way would have been to invent bitcoin its a dramatic claim but isnt as outlandish when piecing together the energy requirements of mining it the slowing rate of creation and the speculative zeal humans have demonstrated through the agesthe annual energy consumption of mining bitcoin is already comparable to that of many countries environmental groups have estimated that bitcoin alone could increase global temperatures by  degrees by  even if thats an exaggeration the amount of energy consumption for no actual economic production raises questions about how governments might regulate it in the future several countries including turkey have already banned the cryptocurrency because of its lack of central authority it doesnt take much imagination to see others jumping on board over environmental concerns as the frequency and severity of natural disasters continues to worsen energy consumption will only increase with a slowing rate of creationthere can only ever be  million bitcoins the creators programmed the rate of creation to get cut in half for every  bitcoins mined this process is called halving and the last time it happened was may  so far it has happened roughly every four years the halving last year dropped the amount for each block mined to  bitcoins originally miners earned  bitcoins for each block that limit is one of the reasons speculators are convinced that the digital currency will continue increasing in value over time so far theyve been rightstories of people getting rich buying cryptocurrencies mirror historys other bubbles whether it was tulips in the  gold in the  internet stocks at the turn of the century or real estate in the  people just cant stand to watch others get rich without participating that combination of envy and greed fuels speculation and drives some to truly remarkable ends to claim their share of the riches there are already bitcoin mining companies throughout the world wherever there is cheap electricity one even recently opened in siberia imagine the lengths people would go to if the price were  times or  times what it is todaythe rest of the storyof course for every nonagenarian saying bitcoin is bad for civilization there are probably hundreds of thousands of young naive investors expecting bitcoin to go to the moon mungers skepticism is rooted in his century of life experience ironically so is the view of many holding bitcoinsince  they have seen the federal reserve backstop wall street through a financial crisis and watched while the supply of money rose more than  that was before the pandemic assets have risen in concert and this generation is likely to want a wealth creator of its own many are buying bitcoin not because they understand the technology but because they see it as a way to afford the american dream they were raised to covet after all if youre constantly seeing stories of people getting rich in a way you have access to it might seem crazy not to try thats not as true for someone who has experienced the pain of financial loss as morgan housel points out in his bestselling book the psychology of money eople do some crazy things with money but no one is crazy
