it’s been a big year for bitcoin between hitting an alltime high trading price over  landing on the balance sheets of major companies and being recognized as inevitable by financial institutions that once tried to avoid it the rise of bitcoin – and the broader adoption of cryptocurrency – is one of the bigger stories of  cryptocurrencies are becoming more mainstream as a form of payment and investment — or speculation depending on your perspectiveperhaps the appeal is in the underlying technology that is the use of math rather than thirdparty banks to facilitate nearly instant inexpensive irrevocable transactions anywhere on earth perhaps it’s the arguable benefit of holding cryptocurrency particularly bitcoin as a longterm hedge against inflation or maybe it’s the indisputable entertainment value of casting a oneminute candlestick chart to a big screen tv to watch the price move on a volatile day a purely hypothetical scenariowhatever the case cryptocurrencies are clearly here to stay innovative employers are responding by putting bitcoin compensation on the table as a benefit to attract top talent — and it it’s not just tech companies this year twitter the city of miami the city of jackson tn the sacramento kings and others have announced their exploration of bitcoin payroll we expect more are coming and to start seeing employeedriven requests for the option if your organization is considering paying employees or contractors in bitcoin what do you need to knowis it legal to pay wages in cryptocurrencythe first question you need to confront whether it is permissible under federal and state law to pay your workers in bitcoin or similar cryptocurrencyunder the fair labor standards act wages must be paid “in cash or negotiable instrument payable at par” cryptocurrency is of course neither and while the more popular cryptocurrencies can easily and immediately be sold for cash this fact might not matter to the us department of laborfurther employers must also consider state laws some of which require wages to be paid in us currency including california washington georgia maryland delaware pennsylvania michigan new jersey texas and illinois the specific restrictions and accompanying exemptions vary from state to state in georgia for example the statute does not apply to salaried company officials superintendents or certain department heads or to employers in the farming sawmill and turpentine industries meanwhile in texas while wages are generally required to be paid in us currency “an employee may agree in writing to receive part or all of the wages in kind or in another form”for these reasons you should pay base compensation in the us currency in amounts that meet the federal state and local requirements for minimum wage overtime or salarybased exemptions any cryptocurrency payment program should be optional and authorized in writing by the employee on a form clearly acknowledging the risks of doing sowhy would an employer want to pay in cryptocurrencyconsidering the legal hurdles and risks facing employers who explore this option why bother primarily talent acquisition by virtue signaling competition for hiring and retaining the best and brightest employees is fierce especially in the tech industry by offering to pay employees in cryptocurrencies companies may attract workers looking for a forwardthinking employer by distinguishing themselves as early tech adopters that offer compelling benefits and compensationcompanies with remote or international contractors or employees might also appreciate the ease of making crossborder payments in cryptocurrency who needs to pick among international currencies and worry about exchange rates when anyone can send and receive bitcoin in minutes with nothing more than a cell phoneis it practical to pay in cryptocurrencyif your company decides to offer cryptocurrency as part of its payroll or bonus program there are two general ways it can be done employees can either be paid  in their normal currency with a designated portion of their wages being converted to their selected cryptocurrency and sent to their wallet or  in the cryptocurrency itselfin the conversion option the employee may bear some risk that the exchange rate available to the employer is not as favorable as what the employee could get buying the cryptocurrency themselves in the direct payment option you are technically making a payment in property not cash under current irs guidance check out the irs faqs a  notice and a  revenue ruling on the matter the fair market value of the cryptocurrency — easy to determine for coins as popular as bitcoin and ether — is subject to payroll taxes and must be reported on form  while not impossible this impact on payroll reporting and tax withholding could be administratively difficult regardless of the option chosen most employers should strongly consider using a thirdparty service dedicated to processing payroll in cryptocurrencyone common concern about paying employees in bitcoin is its volatility risk —  worth of bitcoin on payday might only be worth  when it hits the employee’s wallet these days it might be a fair presumption that anyone comfortable enough with cryptocurrency to opt in to receiving it as part of their wages would be very familiar with this risk many would even be excited if the price fell dramatically right before payday so they can “buy the dip” lots of users are dollarcost averaging cryptocurrency into their portfolios just as they would buy mutual funds in a  but you need to consider the risks that would likely accompany those disgruntled employees who are not happy with such a precipitous drop and you might not want to simply assume that anyone signing up to receive compensation via cryptocurrency understands these swings making sure to provide sufficient notification about the realities to those considering the optionanother concern is taxes despite irs guidance published on the topic in  and clarified in great detail in late  links above many cryptocurrency holders seem to be unaware that they are walking into an interesting lesson in capital gains taxes

warned that bitcoin is “extremely inefficient” and the biden administration is reportedly developing a crypto regulatory frameworkin  ohio gave companies that operate there the option of paying their taxes with bitcoin other states such as georgia and illinois have considered legislation to allow cryptocurrency tax payments – but to date that legislation has failed as bitcoin becomes more widely adopted and used as a currency look for other states to follow in ohio’s footsteps and accept bitcoin states will likely make this move and take other steps to attract businesses just as private companies have begun to dothe government taking note of the benefits of cryptocurrencies is a large step toward legitimacy and mass adoption further acceptance by the government could lead to systematic changes that would make it much easier for employers to accept payment in the form of cryptocurrencies and in turn pay employees with cryptoconclusionthe recent bitcoin announcements by major companies is a sign of the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies as currencies this increases the likelihood that an employee may request to be paid in bitcoin as we have discussed there are many potential traps when paying employees with bitcoin and the decision to offer payment in bitcoin should not be taken lightly if you make the decision to pay employees in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies ensure that nonexempt employees are paid the applicable minimum and overtime wageswhile there are many potential legal issues that may arise employers who want to pay employees with cryptocurrency can likely find solutions with the help of legal counsel moreover regardless of which state an employer is operating you should never proceed with introducing cryptocurrency into wage or bonus payments without first consulting with your employment counsel
