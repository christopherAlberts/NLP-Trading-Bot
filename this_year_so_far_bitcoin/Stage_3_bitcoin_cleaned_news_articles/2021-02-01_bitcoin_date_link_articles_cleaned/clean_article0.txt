spoiler alert i own both gold and bitcoin in my portfolioas a longtime participant and observer of the shifting currents of monetary policy and financial markets i believe both can play vital roles as repositories of value especially in a world plagued by economic and political uncertaintybut although they share some similarities there are important differences that persuade me that contrary to growing opinion bitcoin btcusd  will not supplant gold   as the choice of investors seeking longterm safetyadmittedly bitcoin advocates have some momentum on their side as its price hit a record above  in early january after a recent pullback bitcoin still trades around  prominent institutional investors have become bitcoin fans blackrock the world’s largest money manager called it “a durable mechanism that could take the place of gold to a large extent”yet to paraphrase mark twain “the reports of gold’s demise have been greatly exaggerated” bitcoin is certainly a legitimate asset and has the potential to be a true “store of value” — joining a select group of assets commodities and currencies that can be saved retrieved and exchanged without deteriorating in valuehowever gold has at least a  head start as a widelyaccepted global medium of exchange and value compared to bitcoin the gold market enjoys great depth and liquidity the total amount of physical gold held by investors and central banks is an estimated  trillion that’s nearly seven times the market capitalization of all bitcoin created both gold and bitcoin enjoy highly liquid markets but gold’s average daily volume in  was  billion or  times bitcoin’s daily “spot” volume of  billioni own gold for insurance to offset the effects of inflation and as a safe haven to offset any steep losses in other parts of my portfolio bitcoin’s role in my portfolio is that of a speculative asset rather than to protect wealth i became interested while i was director of the us mint and wanted to understand cryptocurrencies and the best way was to try it since leaving government service i have become an investor in bitcoinsimilar but different islands of financial securitywhile both gold and bitcoin can be seen as islands of security in an ocean of financial turbulence we must understand their similarities and significant differencesin both cases their value is supported in part by scarcity gold is limited by physical supply and the difficulty of extraction while bitcoin creation is capped at  million by its source code these qualities as well as the deep liquid markets i noted earlier mean that both gold and bitcoin have the potential to retain value and in fact appreciate during difficult economic cyclesand unlike governmentmade currencies like the us dollar whose value derived from confidence in the issuing government and laws requiring citizens to accept it gold and bitcoin have other uses and the markets generally determine their valuegold however has an unmatched longterm record as a store of value economists have shown that over the past  years gold more than held its own in times of low inflation and rallied strongly during periods of high inflation since bitcoin has only existed since  and its active trading market is even more recent it is too soon to tell how its value will hold up over timethe differences between gold and bitcoin are meaningful for one bitcoin is volatile having fallen more than  from its jan  high over the same period gold declined about  this lack of volatility is one reason investors gravitate toward goldthe runup in bitcoin over the last year may largely be due to a new class of investors attracted to a more transparent regulatory environment many new bitcoin owners are institutions including privateequity firms hedge funds insurance companies pension funds and endowments once this initial institutional surge of buying normalizes bitcoin’s price escalation may not be sustainableanother advantage of gold is that one can take physical delivery while digital currency exists as an electronic ledger entry we’ve heard about the british investor claiming to have accidentally thrown away a hard drive containing a cryptographic key to about  million in bitcoin that may now reside in a trash dump in south wales it’s hard to imagine misplacing that amount of gold coins or bars by holding physical gold the investor “owns” its full value and has no counterparty riskfurthermore despite expectations that bitcoin would be used for “everyday” transactions that degree of wide acceptance has not yet occurred bitcoin is more likely to be used as money in countries where there is little confidence in government currency and will take longer to be widely accepted as money in economies where government money is generally trusted like in the us japan and across europewhile these differences explain why bitcoin won’t entirely replace gold both make sense in a wellmanaged portfolio the continuing economic uncertainties wrought by  the “lowerforlonger” interest rate policies of central banks and the volatility of the highly valued equity market make a strong case for owning assets whose value is not tied to economic vagaries or government policiesas an investor why should i have to choose between the two i think there advantages to owning bothedmund c moy was the  director of the united states mint and is now chief market strategist at valaurum a company that enables investors to buy gold in small more affordable increments
