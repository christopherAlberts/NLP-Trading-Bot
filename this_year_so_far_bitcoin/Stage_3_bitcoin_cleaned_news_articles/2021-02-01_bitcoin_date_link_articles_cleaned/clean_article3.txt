february    min readthis story originally appeared on marketbeatas technical as cryptocurrency and bitcoin btc markets are there are some fundamentals driving the market these include cryptocurrency’s growing mainstream acceptance the amount of power put into mining the coin and its availability to name a few now that btcusd is trading at new alltime highs the market can expect the bullish trends to continue because there isn’t much reason for the market to reverse until a clear top is formed based on what we’re seeing in the market btcusd could easily hit the  this year and that estimate might be too lowrelated how a series of elon musk tweets helped lead investors to dogecoin a memeinspired cryptocurrency worth  cents there is a cost to mine bitcoinwhile mining bitcoin used to be very easy an influx of miners along with other factors discussed below drove up the difficulty rate while driving down the reward now it is virtually impossible for a lone operator to mine a single btc without the help of either  a vast quantity of expensive mining resources or  the aid of a mining pool the mining pools tend to operate where electricity is cheap but there is still cost not to mention the overhead of running a large mining operation the latest estimates put the cost of  ths of computing power at  per day that’s may seem small but it adds up over the year the annual cost runs about  with an expected reward of  bitcoins or about  with btc trading at  that’s a gross margin of  and then add in the cost of buying or renting a unit the takeaway it costs money to mine bitcoin and that is where a lot of its intrinsic value lay there is not an unlimited supplybitcoin’s value is also driven in large part by supply and the supply is dwindling there are only ever going to be  million real btc’s ever minted that doesn’t count wrapped btc or other kinds of defisourced btc which ultimately will also affect btc’s price but back to the supply of the  million nearly  have already been mined leaving just over  million for the mining community to split up and not only that but there are the halving’s to consider a halving is when the bitcoin mining reward is cut in half the purpose of this is to help control btc inflation and extend the lifespan of the mineable btc pool the halving occurs every four years there have been three so far and the most recent was just this past year the takeaway here people who want to own a bitcoin or use a bitcoin have to buy one of the few that are already out there there are a growing number of btc addressestechnically the way that the btc network is set up there are already an infinite  of addresses the system is set up that way to help make it more difficult to find a specific address and hack into it the more important figure however is the number of bitcoin wallets that currently hold btc  that figure posted a yoy increase in  that has the total number of wallets in use at over  million that doesn’t sound like a lot but you have to remember that supply is limited and the number of large holders and whales is rising by midsingledigits the number of whales btc holders with over  btc in their account rose by  while smaller accounts with  to  btc’s rose by  in total btc whales are holding nearly  million btcs while smaller investors account for upward of  million btc that’s not a lot left for the truly small retail investors who are also flooding into this market the mining community is still growingif bitcoin wasn’t an attractive and lucrative investment the mining community would not be growing and it is growing the latest data shows hashing power or the amount of computing power attributed to the btc network at a new alltime high the takeaway here is that bitcoin’s hashing power has only risen over the longterm and is likely to continue setting new highs long into the future that’s a lot of competition for a dwindling supply of coins bitcoin is the world’s reserve cryptocurrencybitcoin has long been the world’s reserve cryptocurrency because it’s the easiest to use the most widespread the first that most new users buy and its role in defi the proof of this is in the coins market dominance of its percentage of the total cryptocurrency market cap except for a brief period during  and  when the altcoin craze was going on bitcoin has always commanded at least  of the total market cap lately that has risen to over  where it has trended since  the takeaway here is that when the world turns to crypto bitcoin is the first name they seek and the world is warming up to crypto bitcoins get lost locked and burned every dayas if the limited and dwindling supply was not enough to support btcs price movement there is the lost btcs to consider the estimates vary but investors should assume that roughly  million btcs are already lost or irrecoverable one analyst estimates that  btcs are lost every day what lost means is that they are in unrecoverable wallets we know where they are on the blockchain but no one can get to them for  of  reasons the first is that they are really lost due to password protection andor lost devices those coins will never come back to the market the second is burning some operations on blockchains require you to lock or “burn” coins this essentially loses coins on purpose but in a way that spawns new value for example if we wanted to launch our own cryptocurrency we could burn  million worth of btc and produce  million  marketbeat coins defi is growingdefi is decentralized finance which in a nutshell means locking btc or another cryptocurrency into a smartcontract the total value of defi grew at an exponential pace in  and now amounts to over  billion in value that’s not all btc value but btc is wellrepresented the takeaway here is that defi is growing and will continue to suck up btc value and drive demand for btcbitcoin is bullishafter a strong rally from the  lowws the bitcoin market is very bullish btc is likely to move sharply higher over the next year and basied on the recent move it could run close to  assuming the recent consolidation at alltimehigh levels will lead to a continuation we project at least  in upside from the  level
