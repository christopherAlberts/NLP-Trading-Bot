the sacramento kings of the national basketball association nba recently made headlines when their owner vivek ranadive announced that in the near future anyone in the organization players coaches and staff members who wants to will be able to receive a portion or all of their salary in bitcoin soon any player on the kings who wants to be paid in bitcoin will easily be able to do so despite the past difficulty other professional athletes have encountered being paid in bitcoinpay me in bitcoinenter russell okung a carolina panthers offensive tackle in the national football league nfl who famously tweeted “pay me in bitcoin” in may  okung made headlines in december  as the first professional athlete in any major us sport to be paid in bitcoin technically okung was not directly paid in bitcoin he converted half of his  salary to bitcoin through a company called zap the company owns strike the exchange product that enables the conversion which also allows individuals to easily convert funds from fiat to bitcoin soon anyone will be able to be “paid in bitcoin” like okung as strike has announced early access to this paycheck conversion program when okung did this it set a new precedent for other professional athletes to do the samewhen okung converted  million of his salary to bitcoin on december   the price of bitcoin was approximately  bitcoin’s price has more than doubled since then meaning he has made a large profit his total salary including bitcoin profit would make okung one of the highest paid offensive tackles in the nfl and one of the top  highest paid playersnot paid in bitcoin directlyto reiterate okung’s salary was not paid directly in bitcoin in  nfl quarterback matt barkley tried to persuade his nfl teams the san francisco  and the cincinnati bengals to pay his contract in bitcoin but he was also unsuccessful in his pursuit it is tough being the first to do something my theory of why these requests were historically met with negative responses stems from the need for the teams themselves to carry bitcoin on their balance sheets if you don’t have bitcoin on your balance sheet how can you use it to pay your employees just  months ago it was unrealistic for a company to have bitcoin on its balance sheet accept revenue in bitcoin or pay its employees directly in bitcoin but it is becoming more prevalent as time passescompanies with bitcoin on their balance sheetsbitcoin has recently had a high rate of institutional adoption when okung converted his salary to bitcoin at the end of  only a handful of companies had bitcoin on their balance sheets eg microstrategy massmutual galaxy digital holdings since then microstrategy hosted a “bitcoin for corporations” event in february  which was designed to educate corporations on how to add bitcoin to their balance sheets in total  companies attended the conferencethe notion of companies using and transacting in bitcoin is becoming more mainstream which in turn is accelerating the rate of bitcoin adoption in the corporate world in  we have seen the first sp  company add bitcoin to its balance sheet tesla and recently time magazine announced that it too will hold bitcoin on its balance sheet and be paid in bitcoin for a new crypto video series according to bitcointreasuriesorg  publicly traded companies now have bitcoin on their balance sheetsbitcoin in the sports worldthe sacramento kings have a longstanding claim to being one of the most bitcoinforward teams in professional sports becoming the first team to accept bitcoin in  several other professional sports franchises are starting to adopt and accept bitcoin as a means of exchange for example in midmarch  the oakland athletics a major league baseball team announced that they would accept bitcoin for season suites which seat up to six people the team’s administration decided to accept a single bitcoin for the fullseason suites no matter how much bitcoin fluctuates in value “we’re going to hold it we’re believers in it and hopefully it continues to go up maybe we can sign some big free agents with some of the proceeds… who knows” said dave kaval the team’s presidentthe dallas mavericks of the nba started to accept bitcoin as payment for game tickets and merchandise via bitpay in  “we want our fans who would like to pay with bitcoin  the opportunity to do so” said the owner of the dallas mavericks mark cuban if teams start accepting bitcoin as revenue and include it on their balance sheets direct payment options for their players will be far more accessiblethe sacramento kings will allow their players coaches and staff to be paid in bitcointhe sacramento kings are set to become the first major sports franchise to offer a bitcoin payment option to all players and staff “i’m going to announce in the next few days that i’m going to offer everyone in the kings organization they can get paid as much of their salary in bitcoin as they want including the players” said team owner vivek ranadive this means that any sacramento kings player who wants to be paid in bitcoin will be able to directly with no conversionthe kings are able to do this in large part because they have been accepting bitcoin as payment for tickets and merchandise for  years now the price of bitcoin in  was under  which is far lower than the price today if other trailblazing athletes such as russell okung and matt barkley keep demanding to be paid in bitcoin other teams will first have to first buy and hold bitcoin on their balance sheets before they are able to pay their athletes directly in bitcoin imagine the fiscal gymnastics that the la lakers would have to perform on their dollardenominated balance sheet should lebron james make the same “pay me in bitcoin” demand the concept may not be so farfetched we have seen the impossible for okung translate into acceptance at least for sacramento kings players staff and coaches in less than  months“life moves pretty fast if you don’t stop and look around once in a while you might miss it”  ferris bueller’s day offthe fourminute mileokung’s breakthrough story of being “paid in bitcoin” and the sacramento kings’ recent announcement allowing their employees to be paid in bitcoin remind me of roger bannister and the running of a  mile most people know the basic story but in case you don’t here is a refresher running a mile under  minutes was thought to be impossible before roger bannister accomplished the feat on may   but then  months later john landy became the second athlete to run a  mile the feat went from impossible to accomplished by two different athletes in  monthsimpossible to possiblewhen the impossible becomes possible suddenly that mental barrier resisting the achievement is no longer there this was true with the  mile and it is also true for athletes wanting to be paid in bitcoin from okung having to convert his dollars to bitcoin  months ago to the sacramento kings announcing direct bitcoin payment of salaries we are watching the future unfold in real time right before our very eyeslook where bitcoin adoption has come in just the past  months let alone the last  years bitcoin itself has only been around for  years and it has already become the fastest asset to achieve a trilliondollar market capitalization if the price has risen from  per bitcoin in  to  in  imagine where bitcoin adoption will be in another  years adoption is happening in real time their choices regarding bitcoin will determine which side of history these teams are onthis is a guest post by drew macmartin opinions expressed
