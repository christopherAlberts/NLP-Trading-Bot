widelyfollowed crypto strategist and trader michaël van de poppe is looking at the bigger picture to analyze the state of the bitcoin bull marketin a new video the trader tells his  youtube subscribers that btc is at the stage where a lot of its market participants are doubting that the bull market will continue“we’re currently in a phase where it’s  there’s a bunch of people expecting a bear market there’s a bunch of people expecting the bull market to happen there’s nothing in between that’s what we call the disbelief phase so probably this corrective move for the bears is just the start of the bear market for the bulls it’s a corrective period i think it’s the corrective period”advertisementaccording to the psychology of a market cycle the disbelief phase is the earliest stage of the bull market where market participants believe that the rally will abruptly endvan de poppe’s current sentiment that btc is in the early stages of a bull market aligns with his prediction that bitcoin will hit  by the end of the current boom cyclethe trader looks at the weekly timeframe to support his longterm bullish bias on btc and to illustrate that the current corrective move is natural and healthy for the sustainability of the bull market“as you can see in the previous bull cycles we’ve had those tests of the  ma moving average which is currently coming up as support  didn’t really have any test at all until we get here right now… if you look at the weekly level we are still making a bullish outlook… you can see during the  and  cycle we’ve had a test of all those levels  ma previously until we get into the parabolic phase”as for bitcoin’s shortterm outlook van de poppe maps out two possibilities that would enable bitcoin to carve out a local bottom“two scenarios that i’m looking at one is we get a bounce up and then flip this gray zone  for support through which this drop below  becomes a fake out on the low then we start to reverse combined with the bullish divergencesecondly… bounce up immediate rejection at  and then another test after which we bottom out around  and start reversing”idont miss a beat – subscribe to get crypto email alerts delivered directly to your inboxfollow us on twitter facebook and telegramadvertisementcheck latest news headlinesadvertisementdisclaimer opinions expressed at the daily hodl are not investment advice investors should do their due diligence before making any highrisk investments in bitcoin cryptocurrency or digital assets please be advised that your transfers and trades are at your own risk and any loses you may incur are your responsibility the daily hodl does not recommend the buying or selling of any cryptocurrencies or digital assets nor is the daily hodl an investment advisor please note that the daily hodl participates in affiliate marketingfeatured image shutterstockgrandeduc
