miss this week’s the leadership brief this interview below was delivered to the inbox of leadership brief subscribers on sunday morning april  to receive weekly emails of conversations with the world’s top ceos and business decisionmakers click herelike many ceos on the west coast dan schulman has a sort of a uniform blue jeans black sweater and ostrichskin cowboy boots when it came time to replace his boots schulman the ceo of paypal used one of the company’s new services to make the purchase with a few clicks in a few seconds he bought the boots and paid for them with bitcoin “boom” he says “it was pretty cool”the fintech giant had a record year as the pandemic drove shoppers from stores instead they bought groceries movies and underwear on their phones and computers paypal does business in more than  countries and deals in more than  currencies it did a staggering amount of business last year processing transactions at a rate of  per second during the peak holiday shopping season in total paypal processed  billion payments with a value of  billion last year paypal also had the most new product launches in its history including launching qrcode payments in  markets around the world in response to demand for germfree transactions another big initiative helping move digital currency into the mainstream by adding cryptocurrency services schulman recently joined time for a conversation on the future of cash central banks and the security of digital currencythis interview is edited and condensed for clarityhow much did fear of infection during the pandemic drive lasting changes in how people shop and pay for thingsthere were two things that dramatically accelerated the trend of digital payments by as little as three years and maybe as much as five years and by the way that’s just continuing to grow at an accelerating rate the first is we had no choice we were all quarantined in our homes we needed to live we needed to buy things and everybody had to buy things online eventually that turned from this necessity to convenience people realized you don’t have to wait in line at a cashier it can be delivered whenever you want you have more choice more different dealsno  is everything started to go digital even instore because of hygiene people wanted to be sure that they could protect their cashiers and customers wanted to be sure that they were going to be safe nobody wanted to touch cash and that led to a large increase in use of digital forms to not just pay but to look at menus and to look at offers and that kind of thing in storeswhat does your business look like in the next five to  yearsfirst of all retail fundamentally changes it moves from a strategy of how do i attract people to my storefront to basically how do i optimize for home delivery how do i optimize around all things digital online and offline effectively the differentiation between those two things disappears and that means that retailers need to think about where do they meet consumers consumers aren’t just going to go to their website they’re going to be in large consumer platforms like tiktok or paypal or others the reason walmart wanted to buy part of tiktok is they wanted to kind of put shopping into that platform we call it contextual commerceit’s the same thing inside paypal we know that people will start to utilize wishlist shopping tools and wish lists are really a form of creating an individualized demand curve this is what you want this is the price point that you want it retailer if you can give me that i’ll buy it and so retailers are coming to where you are looking individually personalizing offers to you retail is going to shift dramaticallyand how are we going to pay for thingsthere are probably going to be six to  superapps that evolve you won’t have  apps on your phone because you can’t remember  usernames and passwords you don’t want to put in your financial information into every single one of them you can’t remember the nav system on all of them these superapps that will basically intermediate other apps so you log in once you have a common password you have all of your data and information in one place that can be used to feed products and services on that platform it will make it simpler and easier for the consumerso cash is no longer kingten years from now you will see a tremendous decline in the use of cash all form factors of payment will collapse into the mobile phone credit cards as a form factor will go away and you will use your phone because a phone can add much more value than just tapping your credit card and so when all of those things start to happen then central banks need to rethink monetary policy as well because you can’t just issue more paper money into the system because people aren’t using paper money and so this is the advent of digital currencieswhat does this pending shift to digital currencies mean for the financial system as we know itin the next five to  years you’re going to see more change in the financial system than you have over the past  to  years how do we think about modernizing the existing financial infrastructure it needs modernization because it’s inefficient today if you cash a check it can take three days for you to get your money if you do an international remittance it can take seven days to get your money and it’s too expensive the “take rate” across the financial system throughout the world is about  for the last  years which by the way you’d expect with volume and technological improvements that would drop but the worst part about the  is that if you have less income or are outside of the system and you’re not affluent then that take rate is like  basis points it’s not  basis points and if you’re really affluent the take rate is  basis points and so when you think about it being expensive exclusionary and efficient we really need to start to think about how do you modernize that system is there a way that you can do things more efficiently with less cost more inclusively and add more utility into the systemwhat is the difference between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from central bank–issued digital currenciescentral bank–issued digital currencies can also take advantage of distributed ledger technology  or other modern technologies but they’re basically digitizing a fiat currency like the us dollar a digital dollar would be fully backed by the us government but done in a digital fashion and that might allow the government to open up fed funding to other institutions besides banks potentially companies like paypal where you could fund straight from the fed right into a digital wallet you wouldn’t have to send out stimulus checks in the mail—just go directly into their digital wallet through a digital currency instantaneous access no cost and frictiondemand on the crypto side has been multiplefold to what we initially expected theres a lot of excitement  dan schulman ceo of paypalyou’ve taken a very deliberate approach to digital currency investing heavily before introducing a consumer product why nowwe’ve been looking at digital forms of currency and dlt for six years or so but i thought it was early and i thought the cryptocurrencies at the time were much more assets than they were currency they were too volatile to be a viable currency and it was still a little bit too much of people not really understanding what they were going to get into and what we really wanted to do is make sure that it became a little more mainstream so that we would work hand in hand with regulators before we put anything out into the marketwhat’s the demand been like for these new servicesdemand on the crypto side has been multiplefold to what we initially expected there’s a lot of excitementhow do we defend against more and more sophisticated cybercrime as all our assets move to digitalwe need to battle cyber in two ways one you have to create wide moats and high towers and turrets to try and keep as many bad people out as possible but it’s impossible to keep bad people out because usernames and passwords are stolen so the real trick of this is how do you keep data from moving outside so if you make a transaction  it’s not your username and password that’s giving you permission to do that it is  different variables that we look at on every single transaction in milliseconds to be sure that it’s you it’s this idea of big data of really understanding who you are not who you said you are things like twofactor authentication that’s gradeschool stuff it needs to be much much more sophisticated than that and we’ve spent as much as we need to spend to ensure that we do our very best to not allow data to leave our system that isn’t valid but i will say this for every company around the world this is an issue that should be front and centerwhen did you decide on your looki don’t really call it a look i call it very comfortable i started this when i was running virgin mobile a long time ago i’ve been wearing cowboy boots forever i’ve been wearing jeans and like a black sweater forever some people say “oh you went to silicon valley” no no this was me
