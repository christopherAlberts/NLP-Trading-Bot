thestreet taps two crypto experts bobby ong of coingecko and dave balter of flipside crypto to discuss the april bloodbath and what it means for investorsdid the world just witness the bitcoin bomb or the chance for a bitcoin buythe famed cryptocurrency fell sharply over the past week sinking from its midmonth high of over  to under  where it hovered sunday eveningbut the move may prove an opportunity for longerterm investorsbitcoins volatility isnt a flaw its a gift  especially for the upandcoming investor class of millennials and genz said dave balter the chief executive of flipside crypto which provides analytics and business intelligence to crypto organizations in an email to thestreet the last month is a reflection of its natural cycles but also of a maturing institutional speculation and futures marketand said balter any good investor knows theres always money to be made with volatile assetsstill the move shook up some observers before the fall bitcoin had been on a steady upswing with many forecasting that it was not a question of if but when it would hit  just in the past quarter the cryptocurrency scored several new highs and surpassed  on april  by that time it had also grown by over  from a yearago when on march   it crashed  intraday to  according to a new report by coingecko one of the largest independent cryptocurrency data aggregatorsthe past weeks drop also came after several months of bullish buildup on crypto that dominated financial news headlines tesla tsla  get report had said in march that it was holding bitcoin as an investment asset and would take it as a form of payment visa v  get report got further into crypto and grayscale investments revealed it planned a bitcoin exchangetraded fund and then there was the hysteria of coinbase coin going publicthere was already a massive amount of leverage in the market in anticipation of the coinbase listing bobby ong coingeckos chief operating officer told thestreet in an email the excitement of having the first crypto company ipo also led bitcoin’s price to hit a new alltime highfurther exacerbating last weeks selloff was its occurrence during a weekend when there were thinner order books said ongwith high leverage and thin order books even a small decrease in price will trigger a sharp drawdown and cause a downward spiral in price he saidnow the market needs to correct itself because there were many overleveraged traders said ong adding that bitcoin options expire toward the end of every month which usually causes increased volatility around that timebut its still well worth investing in he said if the time horizon is further outhave a longterm horizon choose an exposure of your net worth that you are comfortable with and hold for the long term we are still in the early innings of bitcoin adoption and we foresee tremendous growth potential in the years to come he saidbitcoin banbut there were other events surrounding cryptocurrency over the past month as well despite bitcoins rise through midapril and excitement leading up to cionbases offering it wasnt all glitter for the digital coin even prior to the slipnot only did coinbases direct listing somewhat disappoint in the days following but star investors had been growing increasingly vocal about their skepticism of the cryptocurrencyhedgefund investor ray dalio of bridgewater associates told yahoo news in late march that he felt there was a “good probability” bitcoin could become outlawed in the us he also questioned the privacy of the cryptocurrencys transactions then last week guggenheim partners’ scott minerd told cnbc that while hes bullish on bitcoin over the longterm bitcoin is too frothy and could fall that lukewarm reception from stock investors over coinbases direct listing and a lot of fear and uncertainty spreading on social media didnt help bitcoin suggested ong noting the recent headlines of crypto bans in india and turkeybut aside from the technical and fundamental moves in crypto in the waning weeks of april  much of what happened in the media was little more than hype and speculation suggested balterid hate to go on record for ever saying ray dalio doesnt know what hes talking about said balter who is also a partner with venture capital firm true ventures that said  like any asset theres always a great deal of speculation  bitcoin is esteemed in that it presents both technical and financial implications and thus magnifies that speculation immenselybut he said that people like dalio and minerd are even talking about crypto so publicly on the record shows how far the digital currency has come also responding to a recent comment by value investor bill miller who told cnbc this month that he sees bitcoin establishing itself in the mainstreamthe fact that all three are going on record would indicate that bitcoin is likely entering the mainstream so hattip to mr miller said balter the volatility of bitcoin has always been part of its allure so cutting in half isnt out of the question although i dont think well ever see  levels again as for mr dalio unfortunately the concept of outlawing an asset that is conceptually decentralized is pretty much out of the question and bitcoin transactions are hardly private so sorry mr dalio you are pretty off the markthis story has been updated
