ripples chris larsen believes bitcoin dominance could fall over proofofworks energy consumptionripple labs cofounder chris larsen has a bone to pick with bitcoin and crypto networks that leverage proofofwork pow larsen’s latest writeup explains that the crypto industry needs to reconsider pow because of the effects on the environment the ripple executive believes that other types of consensus algorithms have been effective at being secure while only “using a tiny fraction of the energy”ripple cofounder believes crypto networks leveraging proofofwork should consider alternativeswhile the global economy struggles after a year of  lockdowns and business shutdowns a great number of people are very interested in tackling climate change ripple labs cofounder chris larsen has written a blog post about the environment and why the crypto industry should reconsider leveraging pow larsen believes that if the bitcoin btc network’s verification model doesn’t get addressed then at some point it will lose out to a crypto asset network that does“with more individual investors and corporations taking significant bitcoin positions— pow is heading for levels society will find tough to tolerate as the world works to avert a climate disaster” larsen’s blog post says the ripple cofounder notes that bitcoin network participants have been committing to renewable energy and green sources of fuel but larsen stresses this is only “part of the solution”to larsen consensus algorithms that leverage proofofstake pos have “proven effective in securing their stored value while using a tiny fraction of the energy” he understands that a consensus algorithm is necessary to validate transactions and keep the blockchain securelarsen says that the crypto industry has had a decade to review these alternatives and also noted that many pos and nonpow coins have captured over  of the entire market capitalization“today nonpowbased coins including ethereum’s anticipated switch make up  of all cryptocurrencies by market cap and the majority of new cryptocurrencies introduced today choose to eschew pow it’s clear which way the trend is moving” larsen explainsthe ripple executive addsthe xrp ledger has been using federated consensus to validate transactions and secure its public ledger for almost nine years it’s closed  million ledgers without downtime uses the energy equivalent of just  us homes per year and is already carbon neutrala myriad of studies claim pow’s security strength is superior to federated and pos systemslarsen’s blog post covers a comprehensive look at all the negatives involved with pow consensus algorithms however the blog post doesn’t go over any negative arguments against the security and vulnerabilities associated with pos and nonpow coins there’s a myriad of papers and studies that have been written over the last decade that indicates pos algorithms have not proven to be as secure as pow for instance ripple’s federated consensus or any type of federated blockchain mechanism has been considered centralized in comparison to networks like btcfor instance blockchain and fintech attorney nikhil mehta from smithamundsen llc has said that ripple’s issues with the us securities and exchange commission sec were invoked because the regulator thinks xrp is a security due to centralization“the sec has already indicated that bitcoin and ethereum are not securities due to their decentralized nature which is a hallmark of blockchain applications” mr mehta stressed in his paper “ripple on the other hand is viewed differently by the sec which has taken the position that the development and distribution of xrp was conducted by ripple in a centralized way” he addedfurther larsen’s paper fails to mention the pos coin networks that have been attacked on various occasions during the last decade one example is how tron’s steemit acquisition exposed vulnerabilities within delegatedproofofstake networks pow and pos systems also have different attack costs and one paper notes that the attack costs for a pos protocol can be down to zero“in fact if the attacker’s motivation is large enough and this is common knowledge he will succeed in his attack at no cost” the paper highlightsripple’s chris larsen addresses in his paper that he wouldn’t consider pow models outdated but that maybe these types of networks should be separated from those that provide low energylow carbon verification systems“we should see pow for what it is — a brilliantly designed technology that is becoming outdated in today’s world” larsen’s blog post details “in no way does this suggest that bitcoin and other pow cryptos themselves are outdated their widespread adoption speaks for itself but they need to separate themselves from this early technology that is not built for today’s climate needs and embrace low energylow carbon alternatives to secure their ledgers” the executive addsplenty of papers have knocked bitcoin’s use of energythere has been a myriad of papers studies and complaints in regard to pow’s use of energy much of which has been highlighted more often during ’s thrilling crypto bull run however most of these arguments have been debunked and just recently one bitcoin miner claimed that “bitcoin is one of the most environmentfriendly financial networks”moreover there are not that many academic papers that have found security loopholes attacks or vulnerabilities when it comes to satoshi nakamoto’s proofofwork system still larsen believes that the energy issues could be the bitcoin network’s achilles heel in the future“i would argue that such a change is critically important for bitcoin to remain the world’s dominant cryptocurrency” larsen says “pow’s current energy demands and carbon footprint are already unsustainably high with bitcoin alone consuming an average of  twh a year equivalent to roughly  million us homes and releasing an estimated  million tons of  annually” the ripple labs executive’s
