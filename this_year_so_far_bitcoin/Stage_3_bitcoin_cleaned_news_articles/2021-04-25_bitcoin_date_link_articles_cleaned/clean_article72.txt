bitcoin markets have taken a bit of a beating recently dropping over  however by the end of the day on friday it looks as if we are trying to hang onto the uptrend so it is interesting that we are forming a bit of a hammer especially as it is sitting right at the  level furthermore there is also the uptrend line that had previously been so important sitting right around the same area as well so i do think there is going to be a certain amount of support for the marketall that being said i would not expect this to be an easy recovery because a lot of people will have probably been shaken out a lot of the selling that we have seen will be due to the higher taxes coming for capital gains in the united states at least in theory and therefore a lot of people would have been willing to take profits in their biggest gainers perhaps avoiding taxes later this year that is the narrative for the session so that is the one we are going withthat being said the market was already falling and i think we got to the point where it had been a bit overbought with this i think that there should be plenty of value hunters underneath and i would not be a seller of this market if you remember from the last several sessions i suggested that the  level should be supportive and that i would not be overly concerned about the uptrend unless we broke down below the  level i do not think wewill get there i think what we are more than likely going to try to form some type of consolidation area in this general vicinity we probably have a couple of days ahead that are going to continue to be volatile but the friday candlestick is the first of stability to continue the overall uptrend clearly institutional money has a huge effect on this market both good and bad based upon what we have seen over the last couple of days i do believe that we will revisit the highs eventually but this pullback was long overdue so i look at this as being healthy for the longerterm outlook for bitcoin and crypto in general
