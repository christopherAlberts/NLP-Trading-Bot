in order for ben to comply with a policy of his employer we have not used his full name to protect his anonymitybens loss is one of dozens reported over the past five years concerning breached accounts on the popular trading platform which started trading publicly on wednesday april  and has become the worlds most popular exchange for buying and selling digital currencies while its popularity may make it a target coinbase is not the only cryptocurrency trading platform with consumer accounts that have been hackedfor its part coinbase emphasizes the trading platform itself has never sustained a breach by hackers moreover coinbase says unauthorized transactions are rare in  just  of customers experienced transactions where their email accounts were taken over sim swaps attacks occurred on their cellphones or other personal information unrelated to coinbase was breached according to coinbaseit has become harder and harder for people to protect their online accounts given the amount of personal information that has become available to bad actors coinbase chief information security officer philip martin acknowledged in a recent interview with yahoo financehe added coinbase acknowledges that these are terrible crimes that can have a significant impact on consumers and believes more awareness and education on how to protect online accounts is criticalvictims knock on every possible doorstill two legal experts say the us legal and regulatory system does little to compel coinbase as well as other exchanges to adopt even stronger safeguards for consumer accounts or to refund stolen account assets these practices stem from “absolutely horrible” laws arbitration clauses and virtually zero law enforcement according to max dilendorf a lawyer who represents cryptocurrency investorsstory continues“they dont work its just so frustrating” he said “i see cases where people lost life savings then they knock on every possible doorcoinbase founder and ceo brian armstrong attends consensus  at the hilton midtown on may   in new york city photo by steven ferdmangetty imagesben is still knocking and like many cryptocurrency investors to no avail in an interview with yahoo finance he described scrambling to deactivate his account following what he thought was a typical signin using twofactor email authentication generated from coinbase’s email address“i watched in real time as my portfolio went down and down in value” ben said from the time i logged in to the time i deactivated it was nine minutes and in those nine minutes there were four minutes with  separate transactions”the rapidfire transactions in bens case consolidated all of his virtual currencies — including bitcoin btc ethereum ethusd litecoin ltcusd zcash zecusd augur repusd stellar xlmusd dai dai and chainlink linkusd — into bitcoin cash bchusd then exported the funds to an external account he saidben notified coinbase which he said prompted a series of frustrating reply emails that appeared to have the hallmarks of bot rather than human communications then came the devastating news coinbase said it was unable to reverse the transactions attributed the loss to a “remote takeover” of his desktop computer and advised him to report the matter to law enforcementhe said coinbase’s explanation that his funds were taken during a remote takeover of his computer seem puzzling because he used twofactor authentication to access his account while running antivirus software on his desktop another scan immediately following the unauthorized withdrawals also uncovered no threats he said“i went through all of the protocols they have in place” he saidben’s complaint isn’t unique in  through a foia request mashable obtained  pages of fraud complaints ranging from wire and cryptocurrency transfers that never showed up to the inability to access locked accounts the complaints filed by coinbase users alerting the sec and the california department of business oversight to the financial losses shared another common gripe — that coinbase offers no way for customers to talk with a live customer service agent customers have continued to express concern over the level of customer service to the cfpbthey have absolutely zero live support in a market that is  ben saida warning to that effect on coinbases website is realized too late for some customers the warning notes in bold letters please be aware that we currently do not offer any phone support with a live agentdilendorf the lawyer for cryptocurrency investors described the shortcoming as unacceptable a billion dollar company can can afford to have a small calling center he saidcoinbase had approximately  million registered users as of april  and processed trades of approximately  billion per quarter according to backlinko a company focused on seo practicesunclear which regulations apply to cryptounder current laws and regulations platforms like coinbase can afford to go only so far as the law demands texas am university school of law professor william j magnuson told yahoo financetheres all these regulations governing the financial industry but most of them werent written with the idea that digital currencies existed magnuson saidpeople watch as the logo for coinbase global inc the biggest us cryptocurrency exchange is displayed on the nasdaq marketsite jumbotron at times square in new york us april   reutersshannon stapletonto be sure regulators have enacted some rules applicable to cryptocurrencies magnunson said fincen the cfpb the sec the commodities futures trading commission cftc and the office of the comptroller of the currency occ have all asserted some level of authority over crypto assets and states have additional regulations requiring platforms to obtain a licensefincen for example requires cryptocurrency ecosystems to comply with antimoneylaundering and knowyourcustomer rules for money services businesses under the bank secrecy act bsa however magnuson said the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions can undermine the regulations effectiveness to address stolen funds platforms are technically compliant so long as they know the identity of their own customer but theyre not required to know where funds end up in the event of a breachcandice basso of fincens office of strategic communications described the agency as a global leader in both regulating convertible virtual currency cvc activity and taking action against its illicit use in october basso said fincen assessed a  million civil money penalty against the founder and administrator of a convertible virtual currency mixerstill magnuson said another example of why todays regulations dont fully address consumers targeted with fraud is that its unclear whether certain rules apply to crypto assets federal regulation e he explained requires traditional banks to refund money taken via unauthorized transactions — but its not clear whether that applies to crypto transactionsthe rights available to crypto consumers is not the same as to people with banks magnuson said which puts people who dont read the fine print at a disadvantage in their terms of service they explicitly say we have no responsibility to you if you have a loss that was due to a compromise of your login credentialscrypto consumer rights unlike bank consumer rightsbrooklyn resident michael pierre tested the requirements in a lawsuit against coinbase filed in january according to his complaint pierre lost his life savings worth  in cryptocurrency at the time of the filing as the result of a coinbase account hack he accused the company of employing inadequate security measures in violation of antimoneylaundering and the know your customer kyc procedures and ignoring a duty to investigate suspicious activities under state and federal rulesaccording to pierre despite his use of duos twofactor authentication coinbase permitted three fraudulent password reset requests from a foreign webenabled device with an ip address pierre had never used and allowed transfers into foreign wallets never before associated with pierrethe case went nowhere in a victory for coinbase the new york state court judge granted the companys request to remove it from the legal system based on its user agreement mandating arbitration as the forum for customer disputeshacks do not appear a systematic problemthe california department of financial oversight said since jan   it had received  reports from coinbase customers complaining of unauthorized transactions the agency received  such reports concerning square and squares cash app  for venmo  for google pay  for apple pay and  for zelle which is operated by a consortium of traditional bankscfpb records show  complaints concerning coinbase since  with the majority involving money transfer virtual currency or money service issuesthe sec declined to comment on the number of reports of unauthorized transactions it has received over the past five yearsapp security expert and denim group chief technology officer dan cornell told yahoo finance that coinbase account breaches do not appear to be a systemic problem still he said more detail from coinbase and other payment platforms could help ensure they become less frequent“it seems like there would be a lot more transparency about the mechanics of these attacks that would be helpful in understanding the risk associated with them” cornell said “is this a technical flaw in payment platformsor is this a more human factor”coinbase does offer physical usb security key capability for added account security but the measure requires users to acquire additional hardware security experts say physical usb security keys would protect users from becoming victims of account hacks that occur through sim swaps which are occurring with increasing frequencycoinbase performs a lot of work on its back end systems in order to detect sim swaps that occur in close proximity to account login attempts although not all mobile carriers provide access to this data martin the coinbase cto said in addition he said coinbase analyzes and evaluates risk levels for outbound transactions — sometimes delaying a transaction and requiring additional security measures such as an accountholders upload of an id confirmation and selfiecoinbase also offers customers accounts with higher default security settings than the industry average with options to increase protection levels according to martinevery customer is required to enroll in smsbased  authentication on signup and it gives everyone the option to uplevel their  authenticator to totp or a yubikey when asked why the yubikeys arent required for all customers martin said that the company endeavors to keep the platform available to users who cant access or afford a physical security tokencoinbase ceo brian armstrong told cnbc last week that he’s open to additional regulations imposed on cryptocurrency exchanges but warned that regulation and cybersecurity presented existential threats to his industry he said he wants platforms to be treated on a “level playing field” with traditional banksan april
