there’s been a lot of talk about argo blockchain lse arb in recent weeks the crypto mining firm has seen its share price soar more than  in the past  months from  to more than of course past performance is not an indication of future results but i’m still excited about what’s next for this interesting crypto play is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit according to one leading industry firm the  boom could create a global industry worth  trillion out of thin air… and if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking ’s full potentiala look at argo blockchain’s financialsfirst you might be wondering how exactly argo makes money the popular blockchain uses massive banks of computers to mine large amounts of cryptocurrency it then sells this mined currency for fiat money with cryptocurrency’s popularity on the rise as evidenced by coinbase‘s recent direct listing in the us i’m excited to buy this stockas for its current financials in early april argo released a very promising operational update this top stock to buy had successfully mined  bitcoin and equivalents this represented a  increase over the previous month and brought its total holdings to £ what’s more due to the lowcost nature of the company’s operating expenses roughly  of this revenue was pure profitwhy is argo’s price so volatilebut why do argo shares seem so volatile having tripled this year they’ve also dipped at times argo blockchain’s entire revenue stream is based solely on the cryptocurrency market and its largest asset bitcoin in fact the two are so intrinsically linked that it’s hard to look past the fact that by investing in argo i am essentially investing in the performance of the hugely volatile crypto markethowever i choose to look at this as a positive as i am a fan of bitcoin although argo is linked to the crypto market as a whole bitcoin is the biggest player the bullish arguments for both are one and the same although that is a point of concern for many for those investing in bitcoin it’s a positiveof course my optimism could be misplaced and should the crypto market collapse my argo investment will fall with itmy biggest concerns about argo blockchain’s share pricecryptocurrencies appear to be getting banned by state governments left and right in  alone both turkey and india one of the largest markets in the world outright banned all things crypto they join a growing group that also includes the world’s fastestgrowing economy china along with saudi arabia bolivia and moremuch of these states’ concerns derive from the lack of regulation surrounding the currency upon which argo blockchain relies we’ve got a long road ahead of us before cryptocurrencies will be embraced as a major global new asset class prices could still plummet as they have in the pastgrowth potentialbut despite bans its popularity is growing elsewhere particularly in the us with tesla square and more taking stakes in bitcoin it is becoming more and more mainstream tesla even allows customers to purchase its vehicles now using bitcoin this is why i’m all the more excited about argo’s plans to open a stateoftheart mining facility in texasby exposing itself to the us market with a toprange facility it is opening up a whole new world of growth for itself if i could only buy one crypto stock right now it would be argo blockchain
