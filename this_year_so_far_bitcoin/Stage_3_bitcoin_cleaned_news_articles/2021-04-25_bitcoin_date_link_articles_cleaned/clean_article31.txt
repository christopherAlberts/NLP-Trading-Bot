tesla — a top  company in the fortune  that is run by one of the world’s wealthiest people elon musk — transferred  billion of its treasury cash into bitcoin btc in early february musk’s bitcoin purchase startled traditional investors who now had to understand how their investment in tesla would relate to bitcoincurrently much of tesla’s revenue comes from selling surplus renewable energy credits or recs which will dry up in the next several years as competing automakers produce their own zeroemissions vehicles and build up recs with states that require themin tesla’s filing with the united states securities and exchange commission the company stated that it updated its investment policy to be more flexible in diversifying and maximizing returns on idle cash as part of this plan tesla said it would invest in certain “alternative reserve assets including digital assets gold bullion  gold exchangetraded funds” the statement continues“thereafter we invested an aggregate  billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or longterm moreover we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt”the bitcoin market has seen tesla’s recognition and advancement into the crypto industry as institutional validation for bitcoin’s use as a store of valuerelated tesla bitcoin and the crypto space the show musk go on experts answerusing decentralized microenergy sources for bitcoin miningteslas other businesses produce and sell solar panels solar roofs and batteries the batteries are used in its cars and provide power storage for residential solar systemsresidential solar systems can feed surplus energy into the grid the local power company will prorate a customer’s electric bill based on the amount of power drawn from the systemtesla powerwalls can store that surplus energy and power various things in your home including air conditioners and charge your tesla electric vehiclethe excess energy from tesla’s microenergy sources can be rerouted to run crypto mining operations without crypto mining the surplus energy is either wasted or stored and sold for pennies on the dollar now tesla and other energy companies can turn excess power into a digital asset like bitcoin that is instantly bankablerelated from mom’s house to warehouse bitcoin mining is going industrialhow spacex fits inmany speculate that tesla’s investment in and acceptance of bitcoin as payment is a significant signal of the company’s direction as we know musk is also the ceo of spacex the company intending to set up a colony on mars in the coming decade however us dollars fundamentally won’t work on mars the extended communication time between earth servers and mars servers poses a lot of problems there will still need to be a verifiable trusted way to transfer value between the planets’ economiesbitcoin offers a better solution for securely transferring value between planets on a trusted network where the  block times end up being advantageous instead of a hassle spacex’s colony can trade locally using a convenient local medium of exchange and securely transfer that value back home to earth without any middlemen or concerns about inflationary monetary policies on earth bitcoin offers people a more seamless way to integrate economies between planets therefore colonies on mars will likely be running bitcoin nodes making use of spacex’s starlink satellite constellationdecentralized server architecture to establish the internet of valuethe transition from the analog world to a digitally native society requires programmable money the current fiat banking system is archaic inefficient and unable to meet a technologically advanced society’s needsbitcoin mining is the backbone of this evolution bitcoin is the most recognized digital currency in the newly forming decentralized economy bitcoin has reached critical network effects and is the logical choice for a digitally native global reserve currency the internet of value — where value is transmitted as efficiently cheaply and reliably as data is now — is free from any individual government or entity’s control bitcoin serves this purpose because of the decentralized architecture built into the bitcoin protocolcritics attack bitcoin for having too much of its processing power housed in mainland china meanwhile the decentralization of bitcoin’s computing power will continue to improve as more energy producers recognize the benefits of converting excess energy into digital assets through bitcoin miningrelated is bitcoin a waste of energy pros and cons of bitcoin miningbitcoin mining is necessary to establish layerone security for the decentralized economy a function that central banks now provide for the fiatcentric global economy the decentralized economy is becoming more efficient and multilayered bitcoin’s strength is that it has the world’s most powerful computing network with which to secure the decentralized economy’s base layer upon which all other value transmission solutions are being built we are witnessing the development of a new decentralized financial ecosystem one day you may be able to send  to your buddies on mars without thinking twice about what it
