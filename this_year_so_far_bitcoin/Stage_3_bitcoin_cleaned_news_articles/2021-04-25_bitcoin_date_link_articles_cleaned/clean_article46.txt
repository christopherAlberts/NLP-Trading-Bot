prominent analyst nicholas merten is identifying two key factors propelling the current bitcoin price correctionas bitcoin takes a dive this week and faces a nearly  correction within seven days merten takes a look at some of the reasons bitcoin is taking a plungethe analyst first addresses the narrative that corporate treasuries will cause the price of bitcoin to enter into a supercycle and pump to skyhigh levels saving it from remaining at the low  range or even advertisementwhile merten believes rising corporate interest in crypto assets is definitely a bullish signal for bitcoin he says that traders are overestimating how eager institutions are to jump into the flagship cryptocurrency at skyhigh prices which means that the dips don’t always get as bought up as aggressively as traders expect“this whole narrative that people had about ‘oh the corporate treasurers they’re going to cause the supercycle for bitcoin’ guys corporate treasurers are eager to get exposure to this asset class for sure but they’re not eager to buy your bags at  from originally being at  they’re not looking to pay  per bitcoin with hardearned cash that they’ve made it’s not that big yetand i hate to say that i love crypto we know it’s that big we know that it’s going to be a multitrilliondollar asset class but corporate treasurers like to buy at a discount they’re going to be the people that buy in when bitcoin goes down to the  range… i’d much rather buy at a low  range than at  alltime highs a corporate treasurer is not going to do that”the second key factor behind bitcoin’s correction that merten sees is the amount of overleveraged long positions that make btc vulnerable to quick downward movements as strings of traders get liquidated“at the end of the day people continue to trade on leverage borrowing capital that they can’t afford to lose and overexposing themselves to trades that they should not be doing”advertisementthe closelyfollowed analyst notes that long positions are getting liquidated at much higher rates than shorts indicating an excess amount of greed in the markets“shorts are losing at a very normal healthy rate what we’re seeing is longs getting liquidated… who’s really the ones taking too much risk here it’s the longs guys we can see the numbers here sure we know bitcoin’s probably going to   or whatever exorbitant level we think is possible in this case sure you can have all the price targets you want but if you try to overexpose yourself instead of just holding remaining calm or properly taking profits when things are overly exacerbated waiting for discounts as some people claim they can do properly… if you’re going to try and trade on leverage you could lose it all”ldont miss a beat – subscribe to get crypto email alerts delivered directly to your inboxfollow us on twitter facebook and telegramcheck latest news headlinesadvertisementdisclaimer opinions expressed at the daily hodl are not investment advice investors should do their due diligence before making any highrisk investments in bitcoin cryptocurrency or digital assets please be advised that your transfers and trades are at your own risk and any loses you may incur are your responsibility the daily hodl does not recommend the buying or selling of any cryptocurrencies or digital assets nor is the daily hodl an investment advisor please note that the daily hodl participates in affiliate marketingfeatured image shutterstocktithi luadthong
