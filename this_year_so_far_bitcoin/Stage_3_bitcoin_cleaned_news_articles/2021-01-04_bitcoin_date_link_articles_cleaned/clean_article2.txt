there comes a point in every investor’s journey when he must admit he is wrong about something in my case i was wrong about bitcoin and whether it would ever be considered a legitimate asset class this realization dawned on me in the last month when the price of bitcoin passed its december  highs of  my prior belief was that bitcoin wouldn’t surpass these highs for many years if at all i didn’t think that bitcoin was “going to zero” but i also didn’t think it would eclipse its december  peak anytime soonnick maggiulli is chief operating officer at ritholtz wealth management and author of the of dollars and data financial blog where a version of this article first appearednow that it has surpassed that peak by over  i have come to realize that bitcoin isn’t the onetrick pony i thought it was as paulo coelho wrote in “the alchemist“everything that happens once can never happen again but everything that happens twice will surely happen a third timewell here we are again bitcoin is on another spectacular bull run and investors are taking notice now that bitcoin has survived and thrived beyond its  peak many investors who used to see it as a joke are now realizing it isn’t one i am one of themsubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policyi have changed my tune on bitcoin but not because of many of the arguments put forth by bitcoin bulls for example bitcoin bulls have claimed that bitcoin would be used as a currency that the us dollar would plummet in value and that the halving in may  would increase bitcoin’s price they were wrong on all counts yet bitcoin’s price has still gone upwhat the bitcoin bulls were right about was increased adoption and the ability of many bitcoin owners to hold “hodl” even as prices rose dramatically these two effects more demand from buyers and reduced supply from sellers have helped to boost bitcoin’s price and cement it as a legitimate asset class within the investment community as a result bitcoin has become a form of digital gold you may not agree with this assessment but if you still think bitcoin is “going to zero” you should reconsider your assumptionswhy bitcoin is here to staythe problem with arguing that bitcoin is “going to zero” is there are too many investors who are willing to buy it at a price far above  i remember speaking to many noncrypto investors before the recent runup in price who said they wouldn’t buy bitcoin at  but if it dropped to  they would surely jump inwell guess what now that the current price is above  some of those investors have likely increased the limit at which they would consider buying bitcoin instead of buying at  these same investors may be happy to jump in closer to  and every time the price goes up in the future these “mental buy limits” go up as well increasing the likelihood of bitcoin’s future survival“but nick bitcoin doesn’t have any intrinsic value” well guess what neither does gold which has a  trillion market capitalization so if you want to argue against bitcoin on intrinsic value terms then you have to argue against gold too because both the price of gold and the price of bitcoin are based around one thing and one thing alone – belief the belief that these assets will have value in the futureand right now the collective belief in bitcoin is increasing the cult is becoming a religion don’t just take my word for it though there are plenty of articles see here here and here that discuss this increased adoption within the investment community and if this trend continues as it probably will then we are even less likely to see a future without bitcoinhow will bitcoin behavenow that bitcoin is here to stay you might be wondering how it will behave in the future will increased adoption lead to higher prices i have no idea what i do know is bitcoin is a speculative asset class therefore we should look at other speculative asset classes as a guide for how bitcoin might behave and i believe there is no better speculative asset to use for this comparison than the early years of gold as an investmentwhile gold has been around for millennia as a form of money it wasn’t until august  in the us that it was an investable asset class and in the six years following its reintroduction to the investment community  gold tripled in value in real terms ie the yellow line belowsource fred stockchartsbut since that tripling it hasn’t performed all that well though bitcoin is unlikely to follow a similar path to gold it is likely to exhibit similar behavior this means bitcoin will continue to have huge runups in price followed by violent crashes that may last years and possibly decades in the future we have already seen this kind of behavior from bitcoin before and i am quite confident we will see it againthe difference between bitcoin and gold is that bitcoin is still gaining adoption among investorsthe difference between bitcoin and gold is that bitcoin is still gaining adoption among investors will that continue at its current pace into the future who knows however if bitcoin’s market capitalization were to match that of gold it would be worth over  a coin this is why some investors are so bullish on bitcoinhowever there are still some reasons to be bearish the main one is that bitcoin is associated with some of the most speculative investment activity out there this is most apparent when comparing its price movement to the price movement of another speculative cryptocurrency – dogecoin though you may not have heard of dogecoin it is an alternative crypto currency altcoin that is kind of an inside joke on the internetand since dogecoin’s price is a clear indicator of speculative behavior if we look at the correlation between dogecoin and bitcoin we can get a better feel for how much speculation might be occurring in bitcoin at any point in timesource of dollars and dataas you can see over the last three years the correlation between dogecoin and bitcoin has been quite high with the most recent correlation reading around but if we compare dogecoin to gold we see that the correlation between their prices tends to center around source of dollars and datathis is just more evidence that bitcoin is associated with speculative activity and will continue to behave like a speculative asset in the futureis there a right way to invest in bitcointhough i have changed my mind on bitcoin i haven’t necessarily changed my view on how one should invest in it i believe the only prudent way to invest in this asset class without any longterm negative repercussions is to hold no more than  of your portfolio in it i wouldn’t recommend this approach for everyone but it may work for some people by limiting your exposure to  of your portfolio you’re unlikely to get rich but you’re unlikely to go bankrupt eitherwhy  this was the allocation i got when i worked out the optimal portfolio back in october  anything more than  adds too much risk per unit return to your portfolio and anything less than  reduces your returns per unit risk too much of course the optimal portfolio is the best solution for the past not the future either way i don’t see the harm in a  allocation but please do your own research firstthe biggest risk i see to owning bitcoin going forward isn’t a price crash which is inevitable but the possibility of a government ban on ownership this might seem outlandish but in april  the us government banned the ownership of gold bullioncoinage for all us citizens the reasons for that ban are very different from a bitcoin ban that could happen today but with the recent securities and exchange commission complaint against ripple i wouldn’t rule it out completelylastly i might be wrong on many of the things i have stated today or in the past but i don’t blog so that i can be “right” i do it so i can learn more about investing and get closer to the truth as economist john maynard keynes or paul samuelson supposedly said
