in the eyes of many bitcoin advocates scarcity is a key advantage over more conventional assetsunlike fiat money which can be created from nothing on a bank’s balance sheet or gold which can be mined from the ground in quantities still far from being exhausted the supply of bitcoins was set from the start at  million that means in the words of its pseudonymous founder satoshi nakamoto it should ultimately be “completely inflation free” — making it a far better store of wealth than assets whose real value declines over timethat’s the theory at least with the price of bitcoin climbing as high as  sunday and putting the value of all coins in circulation at around  billion though there’s a different scarcity problem looming largerit’s easiest to think about this in terms of asset allocation when the value of all bitcoin outstanding was measured in the tens or hundreds of millions a minuscule shift of money away from the  trillion world equity and bond markets into digital currency would be sufficient to make its price go wild if investors in aggregate decide to put just  per cent of their stock and bond portfolios into bitcoin right now that represents an additional  billion or so chasing the same pile of  million coins that have been mined to date — enough to push the price well over in that sense the rollercoaster ride that bitcoin has ridden in recent years looks almost sedate at current prices all the digital coins in circulation are equivalent to about  per cent of the  trillion market capitalization of the world’s equity markets that’s higher than the  per cent allocation when the crypto price last peaked on dec   and much higher than levels shy of  per cent that have prevailed at times since then — but it looks a whole lot less dramatic than the  per cent runup in coin prices from their last peakthe problem for digital bulls is that the success of cryptocurrencies tends to eat itself as the value of the asset class rises the shifts away from more conventional investments needed to provoke price spikes get larger and largerright now bitcoin on its own is worth about six times the  million ounces of metal represented by all the contracts outstanding on the comex  gold contract the world’s biggest gold etf spdr gold shares holds about  billion of the yellow metal add in other forms of private investment gold and you’ve got about  trillion worth of metal — but much of that is in the form of bars and coins that aren’t easily liquidated when investors want to tweak their portfoliosthat should be enough to concentrate the minds of circumspect investors cryptocurrencies are no longer a new arrival on the scene that can attract many more investors on their novelty alone turnover of digital coin derivatives in the september quarter came to  trillion according to tokeninsight a research company that’s not all that far behind the run rate of the world’s biggest equity markets the value of all shares traded in japan in  came to just  trillion according to the world federation of exchanges enough to make it the thirdlargest equity market on that looked at that way the core problem for crypto is thrown into stark relief why would you choose to allocate a slice of your stock and bond holdings into a digital currency instead of more conventional assets once momentum stops driving the price higher as it inevitably will the best argument is still the hope that it might balance out the swings in your broader portfolio as we’ve argued in the past the prospect of bitcoin becoming that sort of negative beta asset is the most promising way for it to become something more useful than a dice game for investorsunfortunately there’s still little sign of that happening as my colleague lionel laurent has argued these days it looks not so much like a hedge against the gyrations of the equity market as a leveraged bet on the same movements the correlation between bitcoin and the sp  index was  over the past year — somewhat closer than the link between the sp and the ftse  index and substantially tighter than that between us and hong kong stocks gold’s correlation with the sp  was a far lower  while the bloomberg barclays us treasury index of total sovereign bond returns posted a prized negative beta of minus crypto will only grow up if and when it finds a different driving force to the animal spirits that govern equity markets if it really wants to be an alternative asset to stocks and bonds it needs to start behaving like one to be sure the notional value traded on derivatives markets is often larger than that of the underlying assets because it represents a range of prices at different points in time still its a sign of the sums that are now invested in cryptothis column does not
