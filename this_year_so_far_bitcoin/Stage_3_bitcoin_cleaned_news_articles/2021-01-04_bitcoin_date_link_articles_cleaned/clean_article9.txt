yahoo financeâ€™s julie hyman brian sozzi and myles udland break down the market action for bitcoinvideo transcript all right hard pivot here lets talk about the big markets news over the weekend and that of course everything going on in bitcoin land we see bitcoin under a little bit of pressure this morning but trading above  at the current hour  mid or so we saw you see that brief dip on the chart here on the left side of your screen and we did see bitcoin under  for a time earlier this morning well off the highs that we saw over the weekendbrian sozzi it was kind of the big story at the end of last year everything going on in crypto land and i dont know i guess my question to you would be at what point do we as the financial media sort of stop following every tick of bitcoin and at what point do we say hey you know its volatile goes up goes down and life goes oni mean its not going anywhere i mean so the  conversation was is this thing you know fraudulent a scam whatever no one talks about that anymore thats not really interesting so at what point do we stop caring about every  move in this thingbrian sozzi well i think you have to start looking for fundamental changes in the story and there do seem to be some things emerging guys look cme will launch ethereum futures in february that is something fundamental to the market that gives investors something to speculate on into but again that is going to happennext up and i point to a very cool note out of btigs mark palmer now this is a little bit of speculation but again this could fundamentally change the marketlost in the shuffle last week vaneck a big player in the etf market filed an  registration to list the vaneck bitcoin trust the kicker here this would hold this potential etf would hold physical bitcoin that could lead to really a massive imbalance a further massive imbalance between bitcoin supply and demand obviously this has not been approved by the sec yetstory continuespalmer also notes that in august  nine applications to register bitcoin etfs were turned down by the sec because of concerns about a manipulation and a lot of fraudulent activity in the market but again these are potential catalysts that i think youre seeing this market trade into yeah just to pick up on the etf theme there sozz i have to say im still skeptical that one of these is going to get through because the regulatory backdrop hasnt necessarily fundamentally changed and to your point yes vaneck has made these attempts before and there have been all of those other rejected etf applications so unless something changes in the way that they are presenting this etf its hard to see regulators passing it and getting it through even if under a new regulatory regime under presidentelect joe biden there would be a shuffling of the people certainly at the sec as jake clayton steps down but other regulators of bitcoin and the banking and finance systems in the us as wellso thats something to keep an eye on and of course with bitcoin theres always a lot of chatter right its never just the fundamentals whatever the fundamentals for bitcoin are but of course one of the latest memes to hit is sort of finance and bc people moving to miami which i know myles has thought a lot about but you have to wonder too as we see the volatility in bitcoin how many of these folks are cashing in at least some of their holdings in order to make moves to wherever they may be or make purchases of whatever kind i mean you have to think that some of these people who have made a lot on paper from this bitcoin appreciation at some point are going to want to turn that into real money aka dollars that they can use to buy stuff yeah i mean certainly thats going to have to happen at some point if you want to realize your gains though on the other hand i mean the only real fundamental story that is clearly obviously happening with bitcoin is that theres an imbalance here with the number of people who would like to acquire bitcoins and the number of people willing to sell them now of course this becomes selffulfilling and were all familiar with soros reflexivity and so on and so forthbut you know theres really no other way to explain this dynamic that were seeing in the chart here especially the last couple of months of the year than there was more demand for bitcoin than there was salable bitcoin and i think that dynamic is probably likely to continue if we have more whales in the market so if theres bigger holders of bitcoin then they are incentivized to make a smaller portion of their available bitcoin salable rightthe liquidity kind of disappears in the market and i think thats certainly a dynamic that is driving things and really has driven things for this market for some time and well see how that unfolds as we get into the rest of this year
