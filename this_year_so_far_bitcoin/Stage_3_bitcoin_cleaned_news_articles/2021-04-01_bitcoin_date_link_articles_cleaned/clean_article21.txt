the power of eth and bch smart bitcoin cash project highlights innovative sidechainon thursday bitcoin cash proponents were introduced to a new website that features a project called smart bitcoin cash or smartbch for short essentially the project is a sidechain for bitcoin cash that is compatible with ethereum’s evm and  api which means people will soon be able to leverage decentralized applications dapps without paying lots of money for transaction feesbitcoin cash fans introduced to a unique ethereum and  sidechainat the time of writing ethereum is the dominant chain when it comes to  applications and decentralized finance however ethereum eth fees to interact with a  compatible dapp or some type of smart contract can be very expensive these days the smartbch project aims to change all that and the creators plan to make throughput as large as one billion gas every  secondsthe new website called smartbchorg says the sidechain will essentially maximize throughput of evm and  tools the website gives a person a comprehensive look at what smart bitcoin cash aims to accomplish with a faq documentation community resources and even jobs and bounties“smart bitcoin cash’s innovation lies in libraries” the core components mentioned in the project’s white paper notes “instead of inventing fancy consensus and cryptographic algorithms we decided to adopt another methodology to develop lowlevel libraries with an aim to fully uncover the hardware’s potential especially its inherent parallelism ordinary users and developers are provided with a compatibility layer supporting evm and  so the optimized lowlevel “close to the metal” libraries themselves remain concealed by this layer of abstraction during the implementation we used the codename ‘moeing’ which is added to the libraries’ names as prefix”five tools and many benefitssmartbch leveraged five tools that will be greatly beneficial to the sidechain’s ecosystem moeingads singlelayer architecture the moeingevm parallelized execution engine the moeingdb applicationspecific database moeingkv storage and the moeingaot compiler for the evm the project’s website notes that programmers can “build a new playground for bitcoin cash’s ecosystem and enlarge the user base”smartbch will also offerevm and  compatible and has a short block interval to support defiapplicationsthe throughput will be as large as one billion gas every  seconds to allow more users to practice defi at a very low costhas been developed from scratch and is made of several lowlevel libraries which fully leverage the potential of hardware especially its inherent parallelismearn an extra reward for bitcoin cash’s miners and holders who can elect smart bitcoin cash’s validators with hashpower and locked coins respectivelydevelop trustless noncustodian twoway pegged gateways which can support any kinds of side chains of bitcoin cash for securely transferring bch bidirectionally this enables bitcoin cash to include more side chains for a richer ecosystembitcoincom’s newsdesk was the first to report on the ethereum and  sidechain coming to bitcoin cash during the first week of march of course the bch community on reddit loved the idea and many supporters wrote a comment about the project on rbtc“we are working with the smartbch team and have a test node running should have the uniswap contract working this weekend” one programmer wrote on the forum the first release of version  of smartbch is now available and developers can help test a dapp on smartbch programmers can also download the source code and start a single node testnet at the time of publication bitcoin cash bch is exchanging hands for  per unit up  during the last  hourswhat do you think about the smartbch project and the ethereum and  sidechain coming to bitcoin cash let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section belowimage credits shutterstock pixabay wiki commons smartbchdisclaimer this article is for informational purposes only it is not a direct offer or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell or a recommendation or endorsement of any products services or companies bitcoincom does not provide investment tax legal or accounting advice neither the company nor the author is responsible directly or indirectly for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any content goods or services mentioned in this article
