what happenedbitcoin was rising again on tuesday as of  pm est bitcoin was up  over the previous  hours and had briefly surpassed  per token earlier in the afternoon according to coindesk its daily high of  was within  of its alltime high which was hit over this past weekendmost days when bitcoin is up cryptocurrency stocks track higher as well theres some fundamental basis for this as well see in a moment but other factors impact stock prices as well indeed crypto stocks showed no real correlation to the price of bitcoin today some were up some were down and some traded sidewaysgoing up today were shares of bitcoin mining companies like marathon patent group nasdaqmara riot blockchain nasdaqriotdown a little were shares of bitcoin mining company bit digital nasdaqbtbt canaan nasdaqcanfinally ebang international holdings nasdaqebonso whatbitcoin miners run the bitcoin blockchain network and are paid in bitcoin these companies pay for workers computers real estate and electricity in fiat money therefore they have to sell their bitcoin tokens to nonminers who want to own bitcoin therefore revenue potential for marathon bit digital and riot blockchain is subject to the market price of bitcoin as it rises so does the revenue potential for these companiesthis explains why investors get excited about bitcoin mining when the price of the cryptocurrency goes up but what about hardware companies like ebang and canaan sales for these two companies were largely down in  but as bitcoin mining becomes more profitable theres greater potential for a new bitcoin mining craze which could cause sales to rise again for ebang and canaanwhen bitcoin goes up its good for these stocks but this is only generally speaking investors should not just trade in and out of these stocks based solely on the price of bitcoinnow whattrading solely based on the price of bitcoin is a bad idea because in the short term anything can happen with stocks consider that these are all smallcap stocks and are easily manipulatedsure you could get lucky on a day trade for example anyone trading in and out of bit digital recently is clearly happy considering its nearly tripled over the past five trading days alone however these stocks could easily become the target of a famous shortseller given how easily these can be manipulated these stocks would likely plummet on a development like that  at least in the short termmore importantly these are all reallife businesses that could at any time report things unique to their companies sometimes its good news sometimes its bad newsfor example yesterday the price of bitcoin was mostly rising whereas marathon stock was mostly falling it spiked at the open and finished up for the day but it steadily declined from early session highs this is likely because of its announced capital raise of  million to help purchase additional equipment from bitmain increasing its mining capability thats goodhowever because of this the companys share count is rising at an alarming pace eroding shareholder value currently marathon has almost  million shares outstanding for perspective it had less than  million on march  considering how overvalued these stocks appear to be you cant blame marathon for taking advantage of its high stock price indeed  million from selling its stock is lightyears beyond what its business is capable of generating in revenue right now in fact i wouldnt be surprised if all of these companies announce more dilutive moves in the near future if any do make such an announcement their stock will likely fall regardless of what the price of bitcoin happens to be doing that daythese are just a couple of reasons why eyeing shortterm gains can be a dangerous game when it comes to stocks its hard to predict however in the long term stocks strongly correlate with business fundamentals like revenue and profits which is much easier for average investors like you and me to envision
