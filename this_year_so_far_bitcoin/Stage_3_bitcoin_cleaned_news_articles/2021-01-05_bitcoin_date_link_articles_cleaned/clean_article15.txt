toronto  if there is one question im being asked right now it is should i invest in bitcoinmaybe but my answer is always proceed with caution and here is whythe believers  and there are many including carolina panthers offensive lineman russell okung who has become the first nfl player reportedly to have half of his compensation ultimately converted to bitcoin  believe cryptocurrencies have become an alternative investment supported by central banks pumping out money to prop up economies and along the way devaluing their currencyit also helped that paypal helped to legitimize things when it began to accept it as legal tenderit is fair to consider bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as an investment but remember that it is volatile and still relatively new with many hurdles to overcome before it really becomes a mainstream stream asset classmy belief is you shouldnt abandon your investment strategy and throw caution to the wind because there is a new kid on the block even with a  increase over the past year driven in part by speculation by both retail and institutional investors no question some will have made money others plan to hold their investment for a really long time and other will lose by selling at the wrong timethere is a tendency to have a herd mentality seen in the past with the tulip craze early hot stocks on the nasdaq biotech cannabis just to name a few in others words if everyone is investing in it so should ibefore you decide to invest proceed with caution and ask yourself am i investing or speculating it is ok to take a gamble with a small portion of your portfolio and you might even get it right and make some moneythe challenge is not to start believing in your predictive powers studies have shown time and time again it is almost impossible even for the experts to predict when a bubble might popinvestors may be looking for alternatives to the conventional markets but i would argue this might just be another sign risk is taking hold while longterm investing is being abandoned for potential shortterm gainsfor now im sticking with the basics and still believe slow and steady wins the racemy investing fundamentals includediversification works  dont put all of your investments into one stock one sector one country or one currency know what you are investing and do your research do not try to time the market it is impossible to know which sectors or even markets will outperform consistently over time stick to quality investments and think longerterm over shorttermdont be fooled by high frequency traders also known as robin hood investors who make buying and selling in the markets a sport there is a lot of speculation going on that sort of activity can skew the markets and falsely lead to a fear of missing outwhen it comes to investing my mantra is boring is beautiful i want a boring portfolio that makes money over time im not looking for excitement when it comes to my investmentsand remember not everyone should go to the party it is ok to take a pass but if you do it is never a good sign if you are the last to leave
