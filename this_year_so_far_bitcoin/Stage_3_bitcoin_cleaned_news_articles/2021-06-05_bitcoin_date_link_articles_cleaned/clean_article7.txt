losses pushing the total market capitalization of the crypto universe down by matic was able to withstand the the worst effects of the downdraft thanks to polygon’s soaring usage and constant growth

tangent to ethereum’s blockchain offering high transaction output and relatively low costs without compromising security scaling refers to increasing the throughput of the system as measured by transactions per secondmatic’s impressive performance proves a cryptocurrency backed by strong fundamentals can largely hold its own against a price slide in bitcoin as such the token could continue to appreciate in the coming months unless ethereum sees a sustained drop in transaction costs or usageethereum rivals including polkadot solana and binance smart chain would also seem ready to gain however as polygon is a sidechain that works in conjunction with ethereum it benefits from ethereum’s dominating network effects and thus holds an edge over blockchains that seek to replace the marketleading giantperhaps that’s why tokens powering ethereum rivals polkadot solana and binance smart chain suffered doubledigit losses in may even as matic extended a fourmonth run of gains a

“sizable investment” from the billionaire entrepreneur and not through a simple purchase of tokens“i was a polygon user and find myself using it more and more” cuban said in an email to coindesk at

frost said polygon and quickswap’s momentum might slow once the ethereum  proofofstake upgrade is completed developers estimate that the upgrade will happen by the end of this year or early  after

solutions will prevail even after the upgrade allows ethereum transaction costs to decline
