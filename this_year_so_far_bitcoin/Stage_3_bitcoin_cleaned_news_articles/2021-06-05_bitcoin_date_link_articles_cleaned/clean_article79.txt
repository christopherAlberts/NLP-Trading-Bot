efe videoscolombia is experiencing the worst moment of the pandemic with a record of infections and deathsbogotá jun  efe  colombia is going through a dramatic and endless third peak of the  pandemic with records of deaths and infections and the icus totally collapsed while the authorities increasingly relax restrictions on mobility to fully reactivate the economy the country lived on thursday the worst day since the start of the pandemic with a double record of  infections and  deaths and today it broke the barrier of  positive cases figures that have been increasing since easter however the authorities have been warning for weeks of the epidemiological risk posed for the country by the demonstrations against the government which began on april  and have lasted longer than any forecast and in which not only have crowds been seen without keeping the recommended distance for health reasons but to many people without masks “there are many areas of the country that in practice have returned to normal the restrictions for example in bogotá have been removed a long time ago” epidemiologist jorge martín rodríguez a researcher at the institute of public health of the javeriana university of bogotá on the soaring of infections according to the expert “in the background would of course put the crowds of the marches with the advantage that they occur in open spaces that is the risk would be much lower” bogotá exceeds  daily contages where the effect of the manifestations in the pandemic has been most noticed is in bogotá a city in which the infected have been increasing from the  daily confirmed on average in the last week of april to more than  this friday “the third peak of covid had begun to drop in the first week of may the agglomerations of the protests of the unemployment committee caused more than  additional infections took over the hospital system and are causing the highest mortality since the pandemic began” he lamented on twitter the mayor of bogotá claudia lópez the concern is not in vain because the colombian capital yesterday had a record of  deaths and today exceeded one million infected since the beginning of the pandemic at the same time the occupancy of the intensive care units icu for  patients is  that is of the  enabled  are occupied however medical organizations warn that care for critically ill patients is collapsing in bogotá and throughout the country because in all cities there are waiting lines to access an icu and the few beds that are released every day are for patients who die “what also happens in mortality is that cases are now occurring in people under  or  years old who are in vaccination coverage that has led to the occupation in icus being much more long and of course the mortality is much higher “added martín projections exceeded the pandemic has broken any projection on the country’s health outlook and to date  people have lost their lives a figure that was not in the accounts or the most pessimistic out of a total of  infected in march  when only  cases of  had been detected in the country the government projected in the decree of state of emergency that without public health interventions the coronavirus could infect  people but despite of all the prevention campaigns and the millionaire investment in health services it is only  infections from reaching this scenario which at that time seemed exaggerated one of the priorities was to avoid deaths at all costs so much so that the state of emergency decree did not make any projection in that sense but colombia today occupies the tenth place worldwide in deaths and to continue the current rate before it ends the month will exceed  deaths this figure is equivalent to multiplying by four the fatalities of the worst natural tragedy suffered by the country the eruption of the nevado del ruiz volcano which occurred on november   which devastated the town of armero killing some  people meanwhile vaccination which colombia began on february  later than other latin american countries has accelerated in recent weeks and according to experts thanks to the  vaccines applied to date of which  are second doses the picture is not worse reactivation in sight and in full acceleration of the pandemic the government issued decree  and resolution  of  two documents that will be the roadmap to regulate the economic reactivation of the country and with which it is allowed among other matters  the reopening of massive events such as concerts and sporting events with an occupation of  of the stage capacity the minister of health fernando ruiz warned however that “that does not mean that we cannot have a fourth peak” “the affectation continues but also as we manage to vaccinate advance and finish phase  of vaccination of these three initial stages where we are with the most vulnerable people we can surely have an affectation with a lower mortality rate” express along these lines for example some  people were authorized to enter the game that colombia and argentina will play next tuesday in barranquilla for the qualifying rounds for the qatar  world cup c agencia efe
