by martijn rozemuller ceo – europegrowing positive momentum is driving the ethereum platform and its ether currency forward when the artist known as beeple sold a digital artwork in early march through christie’s for  he used nonfungible token nft technology lodged on the ethereum platform following the success of his experiment british artist damien hurst and others are set to follow bringing a new dimension to the art worldthe beeple collage “everydays the first  days” was a single composite jpeg file of digital images sketched every day for more than  years as an nft it’s a oneofakind asset that cannot be interchanged the token is a certificate of ownershipjust as the art world experiments with its future on ethereum so the crypto platform is establishing itself as the place where a range of oldworld sectors are discovering through trial and error where they fit in the new digital world most commonly the finance sector is leveraging it to tokenize assets on the blockchain—or issue a token that digitally represents a tradeable asset on a blockchain—exploring a new digital frontiertechnically speaking ethereum is a decentralized opensource blockchain technology and software platform that enables peertopeer or “smart” contracts as well as decentralized applications smart contracts are programs stored on the blockchain that automatically execute agreements as predefined conditions are met instead of a centralized set of servers the ethereum network relies on a large global network of servers to verify data and process transactions for those wishing to play the rise of ethereum its ether currency is gaining value in the cryptocurrency world as the platform gains groundfor the period from december  to march  the ether appreciated by an

financial crisis while ethereum was only launched in  they have very different purposes bitcoin is designed as a form of digital money or the base layer for a new monetary system while the ethereum blockchain technology stores computer code that enables smart contracts and can make computations in its own right what’s more bitcoin’s supply is limited – hence it’s dubbed “digital gold” due to its attractions for some investors as an inflation hedge ethereum’s ability to allow smart contracts to run on decentralized applications has caused many to think of it as the “world computer”in addition to the ether  of the top  crypto coins by market capitalization are partly based on ethereum’s platform as of april   when combined with the numerous other applications they have lifted ethereum’s

allows blockchain technology to fulfill its true potential broadly speaking it hosts three types of decentralized applications these run on a peertopeer network of computers in contrast to a normal app where the code runs on a centralized server the cdp “collateralized debt position” of makerdao is an example of a decentralized application or dapp decentralized finance this application aims to democratize finance by removing the middlemen from transactions giving access to everyone it can be used for decentralized trading exchanges a prime example would be the uniswap protocol to trade and create liquidity in  tokens decentralized anonymous organizations these are new types of organizations again more democratic than today’s they use blockchain technology to remove the need for central authority leading to a flat organization without the bottlenecks created by hierarchy token holders govern this “dao” and vote for decisions in a decentralized fashion makerdao the issuer of ethbacked stablecoin dai is such a decentralized autonomous organizationethereum’s flourishing ecosysteman ecosystem is evolving on and around ethereum there are now more than  applications and the number is growing  notably it’s an ecosystem full of experimentation where some apps have thrived and others have notit’s best known as a platform for finance where trading lending and investment applications are becoming established however there are also social networks advertising apps and prediction markets another wellknown application is games with digital collecting crazes like cryptokitties taking the place of their old physical equivalentstestifying to the potential the business world sees some leading organizations have formed the ethereum enterprise alliance dedicated to developing its use in their daily business to name just a few members include companies such as accenture bank of new york mellon ey intel jp morgan chase bank microsoft sap and standard chartered the world computer’s gathering momentumwhat’s clear is that ethereum’s “world computer” has become an ecosystem where businesses artists and others are experimenting with blockchain’s new opportunities seeking to learn from and collaborate with one another as in the theory of natural evolution developed by english naturalist charles darwin the fittest will survive and prosperfor ethereum and the ether currency we
