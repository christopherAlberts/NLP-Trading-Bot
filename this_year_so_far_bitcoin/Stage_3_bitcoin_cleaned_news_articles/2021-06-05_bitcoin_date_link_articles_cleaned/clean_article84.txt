the economist satoshi kambayashi – bitcoin destroys banking dinosaurs – the basis pointthis post originally appeared on the basis point crypto asteroid destroys banking dinosaursthe economist satoshi kambayashi – bitcoin destroys banking dinosaurs – the basis pointi’ve had this economist image on my desk for the past  days and it’s very likely to become my wallpaper this weekend when i finally toss the may  issue i call it crypto asteroid destroys banking dinosaurs their artwork is always strong and this one speaks to me notice the dollar signs in the necks of the dinosaursof course the piece itself is deeper than that it’s about whether crypto is a side show or a legit part of finance it’s mostly focused on bitcoin but notes in one critical line that ethereum has a more compelling use casei’m a banking dinosaur who’s only now forming opinions on crypto which include– only bet what you can lose for now it’s better to view crypto as a purely speculative bet than an investment treat it like a vegas trip if you’re going to spend a few grand on a vegas weekend and you’re also interested in the markets maybe skip vegas and buy the crypto but treat the buy just like you’d treat the vegas trip lost money unless you get lucky– know your blockchains the bitcoin blockchain and its bitcoin currency is believed by zealots to be a universal replacement for cash we’re very far from that so bitcoin’s goldlike scarcity only  coins and fame fuel arguments for it being an inflation hedge and a good longhold investment the ethereum blockchain has much broader applicability — it’s basically a world computer that developers can build new companies and apps on sort of like the web was built off the http protocol as for its ether currency that’s way more confusing because it doesn’t really have a supply cap but of course people way smarter than me have theses as to why it’s also a great long bet– know what iscan be build on your blockchain i’ve asked some folks who’ve bought ether to explain what’s being built that they’re interested in and they’re stumped immediately not a knock on them just evidence there’s a sht ton of speculators out there i recently bought my first crypto called hash that’s the currency for the provenance blockchain which intended to modernize mortgage and consumer lending — among many other use cases i’ll explain more in another post but for now i’ll say i bought it partly because of the albeit large  fixed coin supply and mostly because i feel like i understand the potential of this blockchain and what’s being built on it that’s my thesis more so than the price of the associated currencystory continues– buy in slowly and sure enough i know nothing about the currency i bought in the first few days hash went live and it’s halved since then i thought the recent rout in major cryptocurrencies would result in more investment in this new coin but not enough people know about this one yet also i should have bought in slowly so i could bid more shares on the way down but instead i just took all the money i planned to bet and bet it all at once stupid but whatever — it was  cents a share and i don’t plan to sell anytime soon because my thesis also believes that the provenance blockchain play is just getting starteddoes my first foray into crypto investing — i mean betting — make me a dinosaur that got destroyed by the crypto asteroid in a different way more on that next timefor now enjoy this image and links below on the pieceartist it came fromreference– boundary between crypto and fiat money is becoming more permeable– the artist that did this illustration is named satoshi – seriouslydo you like money get more at the basis point®marketingled digital banks are totally overrated moneylion ceo dee choubeythere are now  unicorns private firms worth  worth a total  here’s the listbanks closed or cut limits on  million peoples’ credit cards in first  months of
