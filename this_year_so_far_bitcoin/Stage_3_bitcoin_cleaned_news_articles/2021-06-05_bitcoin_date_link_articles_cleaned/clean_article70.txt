mediaite caught up with cnbc shark tank star kevin o’leary at the  bitcoin conference in miami on saturday and took the opportunity to ask him why he’s part of the emerging class of millionaires and billionaires who insist on perpetuating an inaccuracy about bitcoin’s environmental sustainabilityo’leary is often referenced ironically as “mr wonderful” for sharing caustic criticism with shark tank guests whose business proposals fall short of his standards and for his hardcharging efforts to make money at nearly any cost — such as the time he tried to convince  bowtie maker moziah bridges to give him a  lifetime commission on every tie he made cohosts mark cuban and daymond john successfully warned bridges to decline the offer and he went on to build a bowtie empirepolitically o’leary also leans to the right waging an unsuccessful campaign to lead the conservative party of canada in  thus it may seem surprising that he has also been vocal in claiming that bitcoin poses an environmental concern due to the fact that creating it consumes electricity in effect the digital currency comes from plugging in graphics cards — or computers — and simply allowing them to run a program the idea that this poses a problem has been popular with some celebrities in recent days including tesla ceo elon muskyet naysayers rarely acknowledge the fact that mining has already produced about  percent of the  million bitcoins that can come into creation it is fair to point out that it will take about  years to finish mining the few that remain but for all practical purposes the “damage” is done mediaite asked o’leary to explain the concern over electricity that had already been spentmediaite why do environmentalist savetheearth types like yourself talk about the environmental impact of bitcoin when it’s effectively all said and done eighteen million coins have already been mined there are only  million remaining o’leary twoandahalf million it’s because institutions won’t buy it until this problem is solved i completely understand the discussion about why it could be a red herring but it doesn’t matter these institutions won’t buy it until we somehow come up with a solution we need to solve that because there’s a trillion dollars worth of buying power that we’re not getting too’leary said investment institutions standing on the sidelines would typically invest around  percent of their holdings in cryptocurrency if they found it palatable accounting for the  trillion figure he expanded on that notion in a panel at the conference telling attendees that they needed to cultivate new “messaging” about their product for institutions “beholden” to esg committees which create guidelines for investing based on environmental and social concerns“a tremendous amount of interested capital that wants to come into this asset class that can’t do it right now because it’s got the wrong messaging around it” o’leary said “the truth is bitcoin’s actually good for the environment because it’s forcing these miners to find the most efficient way to create the power to do the mining there’s no other industry that does that”“as a sector as an industry as a voice we have failed” he added “we have not delivered that message successfully it’s going to start here today”have a tip we should know tipsmediaitecom
