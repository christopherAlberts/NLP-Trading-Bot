hello friends and welcome back to week in reviewlast week i wrote about tech taking on disney this week i’m talking about the search for a new crypto messiahif you’re reading this on the techcrunch site you can get this in your inbox from the newsletter page and follow my tweets lucasmtnythe big thingelon has worn out his welcome among the crypto illuminati and the acolytes of bitcoin are searching out a new emperor god kingthis weekend thousands of crypto acolytes and investors have descended on a bitcointhemed conference in miami a very real very heavilyproduced conference sporting crypto celebrities and actual celebrities all on a mission to make waveseven though i am not at the conference in person panels from its main stage were livestreamed online i have plenty of invites in my email for afterparties featuring celebrities open bars and endless conversations on the perils of fiat the cryptocurrency community has never been larger or richer thanks to its most fervent bull run yet and despite a pretty noteworthy correction in the past few weeks people believe the best is yet to comedespite having so much what they still seem to be lacking is a patron saintfor the longest bout that was spacex and tesla ceo elon musk who bolstered the currency by pushing tesla to invest cash on its balance sheet into bitcoin while also pushing for tesla to accept bitcoin payments for its vehicles as i’ve noted in this newsletter in the past musk had a tough time reconciling the sheer energy use of bitcoin’s global network with his ecowarrior bravado which has seemed to lead to his mild and uneven excommunication though i’m sure he’s welcome back at any timegoods  services are the real economy any form of money is simply the accounting thereof — elon musk elonmusk june  there are plenty of celebrities looking to fill his shoes — a recent endorsement gone wrong by soulja boy was one of the more comical instancescrypto has been no stranger to grift — of that even the most hardcore crypto grifters can likely agree — and i think there’s been some agreement that the only leader who can truly preach the gospel is someone who is already so rich they don’t need more money it’s one reason the community has offered up so much respect for ethereum founder vitalik buterin who truly doesn’t seem to care too much about getting any wealthier — he donated about  billion worth of crypto to covid relief efforts in india a musklike cheerleader serves a different purpose though and so the community is in search of a good billionairethe best runnerup at the moment appears to be one jack dorsey and while — like musk — he is also another doubleceo he is quite a bit different from him in demeanor and desire for the spotlight he was however a headline speaker at miami’s bitcoin conferencedorsey gathers the most headlines for his work at twitter but it’s square where he is pushing most of his crypto enthusiasm users can already use square’s cash app to buy bitcoin minutes before going onstage friday dorsey tweeted out a thread detailing that square was interested in building its own hardware wallet that users could store cryptocurrency like bitcoin on outside of the confines of an exchangesquare is considering making a hardware wallet for bitcoin if we do it we would build it entirely in the open from software to hardware design and in collaboration with the community we want to kick off this thinking the right way by sharing some of our guiding principles — jack jack june  “bitcoin changes absolutely everything” dorsey said onstage “i don’t think there is anything more important in my lifetime to work on”while the billionaire dorsey seems like a good choice on paper — he tweets about bitcoin often but only good tweets he defends its environmental effects he shows up to house misinformation hearings with a bitcoin tracker clearly visible in the background he is also unfortunately the ceo of twitter where the company’s desire to reign in its more troublesome users — including one very troublesome user — has caused a rift between him and the crypto community’s very vocal libertarian sectdorsey didn’t make it very far into his speech before a heckler made a scene calling him a hypocrite because of all this with a few others piping in but like any good potential crypto king would know to do he just waited quietly for the noise to die downother thingshere are the techcrunch news stories that especially caught my eye this weekfacebook’s trump ban will last at least  yearsin response to the facebook oversight board’s recommendations that the company offer more specificity around its ban of former president trump the company announced friday that it will be banning trump from its platforms through january  at least

and svp of software engineering bertrand serlet as annotated by my boss matthew panzarinoextra thingssome of my favorite reads from our extra crunch subscription service this weekfor saas startups differentiation is an iterative process“the more you know about your target customers’ pain points with current solutions the easier it will be to stand out take every opportunity to learn about the people you are aiming to serve and which problems they want to solve the most analyst reports about specific sectors may be useful but there is no better source of information than the people who hopefully will pay to use your solution” lessons we learned after raising  million from  investors” … being preproduct at the time we had to lean on our experience and our vision to drive conviction and urgency among investors unfortunately it just wasn’t enough investors either felt that our experience was a bad fit for the space we were entering productivityscheduling or that our vision wasn’t compelling enough to merit investment on the terms we wanted“the existential cost of decelerated growth“just because a technology startup has a hot start that doesn’t mean it will grow quickly forever most will wind up somewhere in the middle — or worse put simply there is a larger number of tech companies that do fine or a little bit worse after they reach scale”again if you’re reading this on the
