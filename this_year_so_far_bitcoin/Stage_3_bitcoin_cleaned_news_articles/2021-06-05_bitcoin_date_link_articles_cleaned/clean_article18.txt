this is part three of a multipart series that aims to answer the following question what is the “fundamental value” of bitcoin part one is about the value of scarcity part two — the market moves in bubbles part three — the rate of adoption and part four — the hash rate and the estimated price of bitcointhe rate of adoptionif more and more people desire a certain good and the same amount of units are in circulation the price will obviously have a tendency to rise it’s the supplyanddemand rule that governs any market in the worldif one year a hailstorm destroys the tomato crop and there are fewer edible tomatoes than expected it makes sense for the price of tomatoes on the market to rise considering that the demand has remained the same however imagine for a moment that suddenly people want to buy tomatoes much more than in previous years the demand goes up and the availability of tomatoes goes down therefore the price will go up a lot more than in the former casedemand can grow due to two factors participants are stable and the amount of requests increases or the amount of requests is stable but the number of participants increases even a combination of these two is possiblein the example that follows we’ve only assumed that the number of participants goes up for the same amount of goods so on the one hand we have satoshi nakamoto who defined that bitcoin btc must become increasingly scarce over time and on the other there is a possible boost in the price of bitcoin coming from new people who progressively enter the marketit is therefore a question of studying the adoption rate of cryptocurrencies in the world’s markets to understand where the value of bitcoin is headed and overall where the cryptocurrency asset class can go in the futurethe growth in the number of wallets is not exactly exponential but close to it in order to predict its growth in the future you need to use a “power law” function that is able to best estimate its curvature to do this first we put the graph in logarithmic scale then calculate the function that best approximates itthough the function does not consider any potential future increases based on a rise in interest that could manifest in  following an unexpected growth in bitcoin this exercise is used to estimate the growth over time in the number of walletsto estimate the growth in the value of bitcoin using the number of wallets in circulation we’ll need to estimate the average amount contained in each individual wallet using a fairly simple functionbitcoin capitalization  number of walletsnow we have an estimate of the bitcoin value each wallet has on average however the data tells a completely different story  of wallets have  btc or less while  of wallets own over  of bitcoin in circulation and the exchanges own about these reports help us understand the enormous growth potential of bitcoin in the future as those who own a large part obviously do not sell it since they know bitcoin and its potential well those who have  btc or less will be tempted to buy more and of course there are always new wallets opening every monthhowever by taking the average we can highlight an average value expressed in us dollars of the content of these walletssince the average of these deposits is conditioned by the value of bitcoin’s price to best estimate a “range” of prices where bitcoin could go the red dotted line represents the tenth percentile of usdollar deposited wallets while the dashed blue line represents the  percentile this “range” allows us to frame what the entire capitalization of bitcoin should be over time based on the estimated adoption rate of bitcointhis estimate doesn’t consider several factors that could make it very prudent for institutional investors entering the market the average amount per wallet could go much higher than the blue band identified in the exampleobviously these estimates should be taken as an intellectual attempt to understand the dynamics of bitcoin and absolutely cannot be considered a suggestion or advice on behalf of the authorsthis graph shows that a goal of reaching a trillion in capitalization or  trillion is far from impossible especially if interest in bitcoin continues to rise in the coming monthssimilar growth is also estimated by the makers of the rainbow chartthis graph is very useful because it summarizes the presumed growth rate of bitcoin’s value and its bubble trend following each halvingclearly there is no guarantee that bitcoin will continue to move with this logic but it is important to note that it could do so in order for one to make objective reasonable investment decisions according to these assumptions as wellthis article was coauthored by ruggero bertelli and daniele bernardithis article does not
