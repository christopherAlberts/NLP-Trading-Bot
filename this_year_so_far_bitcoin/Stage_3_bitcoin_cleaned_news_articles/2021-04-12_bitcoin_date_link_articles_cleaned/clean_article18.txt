investor says bitcoin bull run is not just getting started runup is in the top of the  inningwhile bitcoin’s price has been consolidating for quite some time now every now and then bulls have tried to press the price past the psychological alltime high captured in march meanwhile a few bitcoiners have been saying that the bull market is “just getting started” even though the price has multiplied in value quite a bit the financial entrepreneur dave levine has a bone to pick with these statements after he insists the bottom was back in december  levine wholeheartedly believes as far as the bull run is concerned “it’s year  of the bull the top of the  inning”searching for the elusive bitcoin bottom and topit’s only natural for a large group of investors who have been watching an asset rise relentlessly to believe that the asset will continue its upward trajectory for a very long time of course many crypto proponents are all about the ‘long game’ and are willing to hold their crypto assets for   and even  years or longer there’s also a great number of people who have high expectations about the current bull run and price predictions are upwards of six digits for this year’s highfor instance there’s the notorious bitcoin stocktoflow  price model creator “plan b”  who is extremely confident in his model then at the end of march plan b said that he believes “we are only  months into the bull market and nowhere near the end of it” and he also added that “bitcoin is just getting started” a number of people responding to plan b’s tweet believed him and agreed with his assessment however not everyone agreed with his sentiment and opinion that the bull market is only  months oldthe financial entrepreneur dave levine responded to plan b’s march  tweet and disagreed entirely with his statement “the bottom was  at ” levine stressed in his tweet “it has been a mostly smooth curve up since then it’s year  of the bull the top of the  inning it’s not over yet but buying more now is for the late and slow newbies who think this is the beginning and start buying now will be rekt” levine addedlevine even made a video about the subject and detailed his reasoning as to why he thinks plan b’s “just getting started” statement is a touch irresponsible levine is correct about the leading crypto asset’s bottom as it melted down to a low of  per unit on december   now people might get confused because of the black swan event that took place on march   otherwise known as ‘black thursday’ at that time btc did bottom out into the  range but every single asset security equity and commodity dropped in value that day and in unison“in this video i give  some sh for this tweet” levine said “‘bitcoin is not ‘just getting started’ the bull run started in  and it’s dangerous to not let newbies know they are late to the current crypto cycle” levine further detailed on april dave levine ‘i hate a chart that goes straight up’levine’s video discusses how many crypto fans are smart but some digital currency investors are just following the momentum of hype “they love the charts because that’s all they got… it has nothing to do with bitcoin right not like ethereum where you actually have an economy so they love the charts and they love a chart that’s going straight up i hate a chart that’s going straight up especially if i want to get in” levine insiststhe entrepreneur is a proponent of the ethereum eth network and his content expresses this on numerous occasions some crypto supporters may even dismiss levine’s opinion because of his favoritism toward eth however a few digital asset fans agreed with levine’s argument and responded to his statements on twitter for instance the popular crypto youtuber from the show “colin talks crypto” replied to levine’s tweet about the current crypto cycle“you’re totally correct” colin wrote “we are midway on the bull run– not at the start anyone using this overbullish terminology and saying “we’re just getting started” is misleading new people to buy in at least in terms of the current bitcoin price cycle i even made a video on this topic similar concept “why i would not recommend that my friends buy btc now” i share a story of my friend who got in midbull run and what happened to him”we don’t know exactly when these time frames officially began because many observers have different opinions especially when they got into the market early moreover we don’t know what the top will be during this runup and we don’t know exactly when it will happenwhat we do know is that there can be a lot of topical conversations from both sides of the fence and in the end it’s up to the individual to decide whether or not they become a crypto investor at this time frame people should listen to both interpretations and come up with their own reasoning as listening to fud or hype and simply accepting it might not be a great idea check out dave levine’s video below to see what he has to say about
