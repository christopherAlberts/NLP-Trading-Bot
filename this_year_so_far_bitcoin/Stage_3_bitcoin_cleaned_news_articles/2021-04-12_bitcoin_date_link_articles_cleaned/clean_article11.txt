india’s beleaguered blockchain industry has finally got some solid support to ensure its survival with an influential industry evangelist evoking the vision of a billion smartphones acting as gateways to the brave new world of decentralized financein this world wall streets capabilities will be available to everyone according to angel investor balaji srinivasan formerly the chief technology officer at coinbase global inc the largest us crypto exchange about to go public “we could turn every phone into not just a bank account but a bonafide bloomberg terminal he writes on his blogmobile banking has indeed emerged as a way to end financial exclusion a chronic problem in all emerging markets in india payments worth almost  billion are now taking place every month via wireless devices threefifths more than atm withdrawals a year ago cash was ahead by  at this rate of digital adoption the lead enjoyed by checks might also soon vanishbut because india has done exceedingly well in mobile payments the bureaucracy has developed a phlegmatic resistance to newer ideas bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are misunderstood as instruments of money laundering that offer no real benefits the country’s nascent blockchain industry — survivor of an attempt on its life in  — is growing up in fear according to media reports a new law might ban all tokenized representation of money — unless it is the central bank’s own electronic cashsrinivasan’s advocacy has thus come at a crucial time a digital wallet that can handle both central bankissued electronic cash and cryptocurrencies will end up “giving every indian the ability to make both domestic and international transactions of arbitrary complexity attracting crypto capital from around the world and leapfrogging the  century financial system entirely he says in his blog posta sometime stanford university lecturer in computational biology and statistics and cofounder of a genomics startup srinivasan is a recognized name in the rapidly growing field of smart contracts running on the ethereum blockchain these lines of cryptographic code can substitute for paper agreements calculations of who owes what to whom and enforcement of claims via courtsit’s early days but if they live up to their hype smart contracts could upend traditional financesrinivasan is proposing to put this newage capability within reach of india’s internet users who’ll be nearing the  billion mark by  what’s more ispirt the think tank that has conceived much of india’s digital identity and payments architecture is putting its weight behind his

think tank’s researchers wrote in a companion paper to srinivasan’s articlethe message is clear the tech industry is picking up the cudgels on behalf of blockchain entrepreneurs with nandan nilekani a

closely supervised conventional finance — such as supplychain financing — aren’t without their big blowupsat a minimum decentralized finance offers a third option traditional banks are slow and expensive while finance by large ecommerce firms could get too dominant “big techs can use their platforms to generate large amounts of customer data employ it in training their artificial intelligence algorithms and identify highquality loans more efficiently than competitors lacking the same information says university of california berkeley economist barry eichengreenchina is reining in its tech titans and may launch its official digital currency ecny next year india meanwhile is still debating whether it can employ blockchain technology in social projects like land registry while
