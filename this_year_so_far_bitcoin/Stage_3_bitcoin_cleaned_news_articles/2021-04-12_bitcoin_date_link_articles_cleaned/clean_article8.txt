are cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens nfts fads or bubbles or are they here to stay in this fool live interview recorded on march  the motley fools chief investment officer andy cross sits down for a chat with author and former fool jim surowiecki about bitcoin cryptobtc other cryptocurrencies and nfts among other cryptorelated topics you dont want to miss this oneandy cross hi fools im andy cross the chief investment officer and im really thrilled and excited to reconnect with jim surowiecki a friend of the fool a former fool and the author of the wisdom of crowds and a prolific writer across lots of different platforms including medium have written for the new yorker and for slate and lots of other places im excited to have jim join us today to talk a little bit about bitcoin crypto assets and all things that may touch onto the crypto landscape jim welcome to the fool againjim surowiecki yeah thanks for having me on i appreciate itcross jim wisdom of the crowds heres your booksurowiecki oh hardcovercross hardcover written a few years ago not signed unfortunately i have to get you to sign it somewhere but written now  i think is when it was four to five so lots of change since then weve had a lot of people talk today a lot of great guests like yourself very knowledgeable about lots of different things including this space but i want you to put on your wisdom of crowds hat a little bit and put that lens in there and explain the wisdom of crowds philosophy briefly then apply that does that apply to bitcoin why and why not or is it more like the madness of crowds that you are seeing with bitcoin nowadayssurowiecki yeah its a great question the wisdom of crowds the concept behind it is pretty straightforward that is that under the right conditions large groups of people actually sometimes even small groups groups of people can often arrive at incredibly good decisions or solve problems in incredibly efficient ways ways that are often better than and make decisions that are often better than even the smartest person in the group the simple example of this is if you ask a group of people to guess how many jelly beans are in a jar or the example i used at the beginning of the book is a group of people who are asked to guess how much an ox weighed the groups average guess is typically exceptionally good and it typically is better than about  of the people in the group if you do it multiple times it actually pretty much is almost impossible for anyone to beat the group now that applies in a lot of different situations one of the places where it obviously is relevant is thinking about investing its one of the reasons why it is difficult but not impossible to outperform the market in investing we know its a very hard thing to do you need to be disciplined you need to have a kind of recognition of what you know that everybody else doesnt obviously the fool is predicated on the idea that you can do that but its hard to do thats the basic concept of the wisdom of crowds but one of the things thats important about it is that for that to work people need to be relatively speaking independent of each other so they need to be thinking on their own and they need to be relying on their own information or intuitions or whatever its not that they need to be especially smart and that is say each member of the group its not even that each member of the group needs to have a lot of great information but you dont want people taking a lot of cues from each other let me put it differently when that happens when people are really paying a lot of attention to what everybody else is doing thats when it becomes much easier for it to become the madness of crowds thats what happens most classically in stock market bubble or real estate bubble where everyone is basically just saying im going to buy this because everybody else is buying it and i think ill be able to sell it to someone else down the road instead of looking at the underlying value of the assetscross jim in some way youre potentially influenced by someone elses behavior unlike the ping pong ball guess if im just totally independent by myselfsurowiecki exactlycross oksurowiecki its not that it needs to be perfect right its not that the lack of influence needs to be perfect in almost any environment people in a group are hearing what other people are saying or whatever it is but the problem is when the influence of other people becomes dominant when its really driving most peoples decisions thats when you really end up with trouble its a problem because many of us are herd of animals in some ways we take our cues from other people especially in situations of uncertainty its very easy to think like well whats everyone else doing its maybe safer to stick there so you want to try to encourage people to think for themselvescross what do you see with bitcoin these days that might or might not apply for your wisdom of crowds philosophysurowiecki yeah what i should preface any comments i make about bitcoin is that i have been a bitcoin skeptic since  that was i believe the first time i wrote about bitcoincross a decade ago thats a decade ago now jimsurowiecki literally and emblematic of my investment career generally i did not buy even any i could have invested a tiny tiny tiny amount of money and i would have been very very well off right now and i did not because even in  it seemed to me like there was a bubble aspect to what was going on preface that just take everything i say in that regard with a grain of salt i think the fascinating thing about bitcoin is that there is no obvious fundamental value to it its very different from investing in stocks where the underlying free cash flow that these companies are generating now or will generate in the future constitutes that kind of bedrock fundamental value that the markets judgment is always i would argue in one way or another circling around sometimes it gets way out of whack sometimes it actually undervalues it thats how you can make money the way you all have but the assumption is that its always circling around with bitcoin the dynamic is very different bitcoin is much more at this point i think like a digital gold its not even really a currency one of the things that is interesting about bitcoin is that when it began the dream of bitcoin was that it was going to become a digital currency that was going to potentially be able to replace or at least compete with traditional fiat for instance like the dollar i think that dream is pretty much dead i think it really is much more of a digital asset the problem when evaluating digital assets or assets like gold or collectibles is another example is that its hard to figure out what true value is because true value actually depends on what other people are willing to pay for it on some level the thing i would say about bitcoin at this point is that i think it does have a decade in which more and more people have been willing to put their money into it and see it as a store of value probably means that its a mistake to just write it off as the entire thing is a bubble i think that at this point it has a certain amount of collective weight behind it so i totally agree with that i think the problem with bitcoin from an investing point of view to be honest is i just have no idea how you decide what its worth one of the challenges when it comes to deciding when to get into bitcoin or get out of bitcoin is that its very hard to figure out what fundamental value is and i would say the exact same thing about it but in the case of bitcoin i do think there clearly are periods where it is very bubblelicious there are periods where it is clearly the price is being driven up because elon  tweets about it or everyone just suddenly starts to pay attention to it im sure youve thought about it a ton of times bitcoin was the best performing asset of the  but at the same time if you look at the volatility the rises and falls are extraordinarycross yeahsurowiecki i think if youre going to be a bitcoin person you have to have diamond hands to quote that reddit phrase but i also think i will be very wary of buying at the end of any period or in the middle of any period where theres a lot of publicity about bitcoin because i think thats a moment where youre getting a lot of frothy buying i think thats one of the things you should look out forcross yeah and our analyst bernd schmid talked a little bit about that in his interview talking about the different cycles they had talked about which is really fascinating if you look forward three or five years and you write wisdom of crowds  do you think bitcoin andor crypto currencies or crypto assets because youve written recently about the difference between how bitcoin started as a cryptocurrency as you mentioned satoshis original whitepaper was really focused on part of it was on how it can be a currency and now its really converted more to assets in some form of asset like you said digital gold if you were going to write three or five years forward wisdom of crowds  do you think bitcoin has a spot theresurowiecki im not sure i would frame it in terms of the wisdom of crowds exactly i think whats interesting to me about bitcoin and other crypto currencies but also even like to a lesser degree its different but i think that there are connections between something like whats been happening with gamestop nysegme over the last what is it now a month and a half its gone on much longer than i thought it wouldcross a few monthssurowiecki but part of whats interesting about bitcoin is that theres an element of collective will to it in other words if you think about the stock market the way the stock market typically functions and lets leave gamestop out because i think gamestop is an unusual example is that you have lots of different people all over the world who are making independent decisions about whether or not to buy the stock now they may be looking at what other people are willing to do theyre talking to each other theyre listening to cnbc but everyones like i think its worth x or i dont think its worth x or whatever it is then they all arrive at that bitcoin obviously has an element of that but bitcoin also theres an element of a collective decision that this thing is going to be worth something bitcoin actually has you can call them true believers but actually has people who are evangelists the idea is like were going to make this into a strong digital asset since people working together to turn this thing from when it was just like dream that satoshi had come up with and that over thise past decade have made it into something actual and real i think it is a fascinating example of collective action and one that i think would have been very hard to anticipate a decade ago i think in terms of the currency thing ive written about this a lot and david and i talked about it a few weeks ago i think there are elements to the way bitcoin functions that make it very hard to function as a currency so i dont ever really think its going to be that ethereum cryptoeth is obviously being used quite a bit say for instance with nfts is actually pretty essential to that but im also a guy who doesnt have any problem with the dollar or fiat currency i think they function fine for most people i dont see theres really a use case for replacing them in most situationscross i think nic carter had talked about this and not necessarily against fiat currency or its not just only one or the other i guess i should say what would it take for jim surowiecki whos been a skeptic to be more of a believer in the usability of bitcoin as a currency knowing all you know and all youve learned over the last decade of writing about bitcoinsurowiecki i find it hard to imagine any scenario in which i would think bitcoin itself would because i think the fact that bitcoin supply is limited which is of course the thing that people like about it people who like it as a hedge against inflationcross they like it as an asset because its restricted to  millionsurowiecki exactly but its one of the reasons why people even like the idea of it as a currency because its the same reason why there are people who still think we should be on the gold standard because they think well that means that the value of it cant be deflated away thats great for an asset i think its terrible as a currency for me currencies are about use you want it to be used and the problem with a limited supply is theres always this incentive to just hoard it because if you know there are going to be no more of them why would you necessarily want to spend it unless it really isnt worth that much in which case you say ok now we can use it i think the way bitcoin is constructed the paradox is that the very things that make it appealing to a lot of people i think are the things that make it hard to function as a currency i mean some of the technical stuff i assume they can probably find ways around in terms of likecross energy usage you mean like that thingsurowiecki the fact that limited number of how few transactions that they can handle and how long it takes to that stuff i think theyre probably i know people are already working to try to solve those but having said that its not clear to me that any of those limitations necessarily apply to other crypto currencies the problem you have is that when it comes to say limited supplies if you dont have limited supply when it comes to crypto then its like wait a second how do i know how many coins are there you just have unlimited or you have the equivalent of the central bank with a cryptocurrency then it is a little like how do i decide whether or not if this is really going to hold any value at all its a challenge i think in that regard the other thing i think youre going to see is i think it will be shocking if central banks dont really essentially move into digital currencies having said that one of the reasons why im skeptical of the longterm use case is that maybe partly as a result of crypto its so much easier to transfer ordinary money now than it used to be im just thinking about something like zelle its a trivial thing but as recently as five or  years ago if you wanted to send money to someone digitally effectively it cost it cost you money it took time you oftentimes had to call the bank to check its so much easier so i think in that regard youve actually seen traditional banks take on a lot of these characteristicscross jim you write a lot about just the business world and the financial world and you mentioned nfts nonfungible tokens a little bit earlier lets just maybe pivot a little bit toward that direction putting on again your forecast hat or your futuristic hat does the concept of an nft and the blockchain that concept broaden out from bitcoin and just currencies as a watcher and an observer of financial behavior and business behavior does that excite you a little bit moresurowiecki ive always been interested in the blockchain i think the blockchain obviously has certain aspects of it that lend itself to basically greater efficiency greater security all the things that people have talked about it may be that there are other mechanisms to do it but i do think that companies are going to use it more and more in terms of supply chains and things like that when it comes to nfts so if you want to talk about a bubble nfts are a bubble like that  is clearly a bubblecross first could you just give us a  jim surowieckis definition of a bubble so we know that were in onesurowiecki i think the price of many many nfts is primarily being driven by speculative behavior in anticipation of price increases rather than a rational calculation of value now obviously when it comes to collectibles which is in a lot of ways what most of the highprofile nfts are it is hard to know what fundamental value is but i think the thing thats fascinating about nfts is you can clearly see media interest and public frenzy driving up pricescross yeah maybe give a few examples jimsurowiecki so the most obvious example is this piece of digital art by beeple which sold for  million supposedly at a christies auction what last week was it i guess it was last weekcross yeahsurowiecki the more ubiquitous form of it is lets say nba top shot which is a place where you can go and buy theyre effectively digital trading cards that feature highlights from various nba players its been up for less than a year and the amount i think theyve had days where theyve transacted  million of these things in one day i think nfts are fascinating and strange but the thing thats oddest to me about nfts and lets take nba top shot for example the way nba top shot works is they basically make these highlights and they have a certain number of them a certain number of that highlights in some cases the numbers are low like there is a famous one that is the first block shot i think of zion williamson and there were  of those made theres some kind of scarcity value some unique value whatever you can buy them on this site you can sell them you can also buy packs that have these moments most of which are pretty useless like in any baseball card collection but the thing thats amazing to me is that i wrote about this yesterday i will give you one concrete example there is a highlight of a new york knicks player named rj barrett whos in his second year the highlight is his first basket in the nba which happened last october its a layup its just a fine euro step layup its nothing big there were almost  of those issued so theres  of them that exist and the cheapest one for sale there are  of them for sale or they were there yesterday on the top shot spot and the cheapest one cost  im like this is just rj barrett and there are  of them and the cheapest one is  i think whats fascinating to me about the nft market at least top shot and i think it applies in other ones some elements of the digital art market as well is that in most collectible markets it took a long time for speculators to get into those markets if you think about baseball cards people didnt get interested in investing in baseball cards until probably the  really so thats part of the reason or comic books is the same way thats why the old ones are so valuable because no one thought of paying high prices for them and a lot of them were just destroyed or wrecked with nfts speculators have been in on that almost from the start if you buy the wisdom of crowds on any level that obviously is going to make prices more efficient if you can buy that rj barrett thing for five bucks which is what a lot of these guys did i think back in september then thats one thing if you have to pay  for it your upside is just so much smaller you dont want to buy amazon and maybe amazon is not a good example but you want to buy assets at low prices you dont want to get in after everyone else has already done it so that i think is a really complicated thing about the nft market the one thing i would say is its totally possible that as nfts become more well known youre going to see money flood in and id say as the market expands abroad i think right now youre not allowed to buy nfts say from top shot from china that may be wrong but lets say as the market expands you can totally see price spikes i would not be surprised to see that but i do think longterm its hard to make money in that market but im a skepticcross i like playing the game my daughters are young so theyre six and nine and im wondering will the sixyearold have to have a drivers license and will she learn how to drive a car  to buy a manual or automation i play it forward and start thinking about digital currencies and crypto assets and nfts and just what is their world is going to be like so again put on your futuristic hat for me a little bit do you foresee a time in the next  years where they are much more not just interested but actual in reality they are making transactions with digital currenciessurowiecki i can imagine them doing that i can imagine people using ethereum or other currencies my general sense is that when it comes to everyday transactions and transactions that dont try to circumvent the government in one form or another i continue to believe that the dollar is going to be or the yen or whatever will continue to be essentially the currency of choice i think the ease of transactions is only going to go up with traditional currencies i dont think its going to fall and i think crypto is obviously helping push that forward i do think that the blockchain will probably become more and more of a part of peoples lives so things like nfts i could imagine them becoming fairly common ways for people to either sell art or sell other kinds of digital objects that they want to just because you have the value of the security you have some clear statement of ownership and the like but i do have a hard time imagining a scenario in which say fiat currencie lose the kind of usefulness they have right now at least certainly for  or  years i cant quite imaginecross how about regulation jim weve seen there really is not an etf for example to invest specifically in bitcoin theres the grayscale trust otcgbtc what do you see from the regulatory side or what do you foresee from the regulatory side i think weve seen some recent news about maybe the office of the controller weve seen obviously a lot of companies paypal offering the ability to use bitcoin and obviously lots of companies that are including the motley fool have been buying bitcoin for their balance sheet how about from the regulatory front any thoughts or interest theresurowiecki to me a company to look is a company like coinbase one of the things thats obviously fascinating about or challenging about crypto for a lot of people including myself is the hassle involved to get it to buy it and then if you want to be able to transact its a little tricky its not a huge hassle but relative to buying stock its obviously much more complicated and the like so the paradox is that thats why places like coinbase and others like it have emerged and evaluations are just out of sight because people like centralized places where they know they can transact and where its easy the paradox is that to some degree i think subverts the idea of decentralized finance and actually creates locations where regulators can focus their attention so that i think going forward i have no good prediction about it but i do think going forward that is going to be very interesting to see i think regulators have generally with the exception of tax authorities taken a pretty handsoff approach to this stuff i think thats good i dont think theres any reason why in general i think regulators should encourage innovation and allow people to experiment and not stress too much about people potentially losing money or whatever some of that is just the consequence of people making individual choices but i do think the fact that youre likely to end up with places that are very big essentially centralized trading places does make it more likely and because it makes it easier for regulators to say ok so you have all these accounts so ok so we can actually go in and seeing whether or not these people are actually paying their taxes that i think it would be shocking especially as bitcoin becomes more and more valuable that you dont see more intrusion along those linescross yeah its interesting the cold storage versus the centralized storage and where i can trade and access and which ones we talked about some people talked about this earlier today and how much i can download to my own drive and hold it myself which is riling a lot of people taking those who own gold bricks in their basement versus those who might own some gold etf for gold miners or lots of different wayssurowiecki yeah i think its just fascinating because you see this collision as crypto becomes more mainstream its inevitably the impulse or the need for making it more accessible easier to use all of those things rather than being something you need to be really tech savvy to use thats inevitable and one consequence of that is that your decentralized places are going to become more influential i think thats inevitablecross jim i also dont own bitcoin and i know its been just this wonderful longterm volatile performing asset but lets just say my last question here before we wrap up our interview and thank you so much for your time but if bitcoin gets to  its maybe  today or so would that surprise you what wouldve we as any skeptic or doubters may have gotten wrong or did we not get it wrong and thats just the nature of marketssurowiecki yeah its a great question it would very much surprise me but like i said it very much surprises me that bitcoin is at  there or is it up to  whatever its up almost  this year already it would very much surprise me i certainly have a hard time imagining it getting that high anytime soon and i think if it worked you would have a lot of ups and downs i think i would say i was wrong about the idea of it being a sustainable asset i dont think i was wrong about the currency and in fact most of my writing about bitcoin has always been around this question a bit as a currency and why it was not really well designed to do that and why it wasnt functioningcross the volatility of it makes it very hard to dosurowiecki volatility of it that the impulse to hoard the transaction issues and the rest i think the thing i got wrong was i assume that bitcoins value as an asset was going to be in some way tied to its use value in other words if bitcoin was not useful as a currency or was not being used widely as a currency then ultimately its value as an asset would therefore be somewhat ephemeral because people will be like why do i want to buy bitcoin as opposed to x y or z one of these other things i think what has happened i dont think we have a good explanation of why it happened but what i think has happened is that people have effectively collectively decided this is our gold basically and we are willing to put our money into this because we think other people will continue to respect it has value its possible that will blow up at some point but there probably is a point at which the fact that everyone says its so makes it so there probably is some point at which that happened and i can imagine it going back down to  or whatever but its not entirely obvious exactly what would do thatcross yeahsurowiecki we know what would do that if there was massive hacking and if that somehow were to happen i dont think it will but if it were i think that would obviously changed the dynamic people suddenly were like woah wait a minute i dont actually have this thing but in the absence of that i dont know thats why its strange to think about in terms of bubbles because with bubbles the one thing i would say is and this is i think one of the interesting things about it is that the paradox of stock market bubbles is that the fact that there is a fundamental value i think to companies actually makes it easier in the end for the bubble to pop the great example would be cisco nasdaqcsco when cisco got to i came at which market capital it was like  billion or something in  that maybe overstated but somewhere like that you could do the math and it was like there was no way cisco was ever going to be able to get to a  billion present value in generating free cash flow going forward it was almost like literally impossible theres always that something bringing it back to earth the paradoxes in bitcoins case there is nothing bringing it back to earth in a weird way that makes it harder to think of it as a bubble it doesnt make the ups and downs its easy to say ok its up to  because its whatever maybe well go back to  i dont know it feels like its arrived on some levelcross yeah well jim thanks so much for sharing your thoughts and well have to leave it there maybe we can come back and revisit in  years or when my daughters drivingsurowiecki  at  or whatever which is probably next weekcross well thanks so much for joining us on the bitcoin theme day here at the motley fool jim appreciate your thoughtssurowiecki thanks for having me on i appreciate it
