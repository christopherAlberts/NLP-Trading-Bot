the financial action task force fatf is the international body that coordinates the development of international standards on combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism and weapons proliferation fatf implements these standards through a series of recommendations to national governments who are ultimately responsible for their implementationon march   fatf published a draft of its upcoming revised guidance the draft guidance on the recommended riskbased approach applicable to entities engaging in activities involving virtual assets vas including traditional financial institutions as well as entities considered virtual asset service providers vasps the proposed revised recommendations in the draft guidance the va recommendations clarify fatf’s most current recommendations contained in the final guidance on vas and vasps which was published in june  the  guidance the draft guidance is currently open to public consultation and is expected to be published in final form in june the  guidance explicitly placed antimoney laundering and countering the financing of terrorism amlcft obligations on entities considered vasps however the definition of vasp in the  guidance was relatively narrow focusing on those entities such as centralised digital asset exchanges with a custodial relationship with vas on behalf of customers ie knowledge of the private keys needed to move the vas from one blockchain address to anotherit was also generally clear that providers of noncustodial software wallets ie software that allow a user to control their private keys and interact with others without reliance on a third party providers of multisig services ie where a third party may control a “ of n” private key to provide added security to a user software based “decentralised exchanges” ie platforms that allow for the atomic or instantaneous exchange of one va for another without the use of a third party and other noncustodial services were not considered vaspsthe draft guidance significantly expands on the  guidance in a number of ways includingproviding guidance on how the va recommendations apply to what fatf refer to as “socalled stablecoins” an intended swipe at the marketing of certain vasproviding additional guidance on the risks and potential risk mitigants for peertopeer transactionsproviding updated guidance on the licensing and registration of vaspsproviding additional guidance for the public and private sectors on the implementation of the travel ruleincluding principles of informationsharing and cooperation amongst vasp supervisorshowever the most important aspect of the draft guidance is likely that it broadens the definition of va and clarifies that the definition of vasp extends well beyond that suggested in the  guidance in particular the draft guidance clarifies that both of these definitions are intended to be read expansively by national amlkyc regulators and that there should not be a case under national financial regulations where a financial asset is not covered by the fatf standards either as a va or as a traditional financial assetdecentralised financesquarely in the sights of the draft guidance is the rapidly growing area of decentralised finance defi the term defi is used to refer to financial tools built on open permissionless blockchainbased networks most notably ethereum these tools utilise vas such as bitcoin ether and other digital assets compatible with the  standard and do not involve the “custodying” of these assets by any individual or business instead the relevant vas are sent to the address of a smart contract computer code stored on the relevant blockchain network where the vas will remain locked until a user or the relevant code sends the assets elsewheresee also interoperability a key challenge for central bank digital currenciesaccordingly scale in defi is usually measured by total value locked tvl – the total value usually expressed in terms of us dollars of all the vas locked in smart contracts at any given time as of a recent date almost  billion in vas were locked in defi smart contractsunsurprisingly defi platforms are generally promoted as being decentralised although what is meant by this term in this context is open to debate what can be said is that almost all defi products and services are automated meaning that once a transaction is initiated by a user smart contracts will carry out the transaction transparently and deterministically without the use of intermediary entities anyone with access to the internet can confirm the outcome of the transaction although parties are identified only pseudonymously through the blockchain addresses used to execute the transactionproponents of defi seek to create decentralised alternatives to nearly every traditional financial service including lending retail payments deposit and savings accounts swaps options and derivatives transactions insurance and asset trading exchange and managementhow does all this magic occur defi is able to function without intermediaries because of a number of unique features first all defi transactions are either prefunded by the user or overcollateralised by the borrower second due to the automation built into the various protocols remedial actions such as margin calls or default enforcement can occur without the use of any timeconsuming and costly legal process and of course without regard to any traditional rights parties may otherwise have under any bankruptcy reorganisation or similar lawsthird many different digital assets have developed extremely high levels of liquidity at least most of the time meaning that pledged assets can be disposed of automatically and almost instantaneously without needing to relay on human intervention to find a buyersee also coinbase ipo will be a turning pointmost importantly these platforms seek to distinguish between the smart contract code that is readily available to anyone interested to copy and perhaps improve upon and the individuals and legal entities they have formed to exploit and benefit from these various codebases the former it is argued are the equivalent of public utilities while the latter are legitimate businesses that seek to benefit from these utilities in the same way that any other business may choose to do complicating matters many defi platforms have issued digital assets known as governance tokens that allow the owner of the token to vote on certain governance matters and potentially receive a portion of the fees paid by users of the platform generally in the form of an inkind distribution of portions of the digital assets borrowed or traded on the platformfatf’s responsethings move very quickly in the world of blockchain when the  guidance was put in place defi was bare a blip on the radar most vas were transferred between centralised digital asset exchanges or in privately negotiated transactions from one wallet to another known as the otc market at that time financial regulators around the world seemed content to focus on ensuring that these centralised entities implemented rigorous kycaml compliance programs and left it therehowever things changed dramatically in the summer of  which came to be known as defi summer a confluence of factors led to an explosion in the use of these protocols and a virtuous cycle which some might call a bubble of demand for and interest in defi protocols these factors included the successful deployment and maturing of a number of defi protocols including compound which recently became the first defi protocol to exceed  billion in tvl uniswap and aave the introduction of rewards in the form of governance tokens and other new vas being distributed to those who made their existing vas available for liquidity for trading by others known as liquidity farming increasing prices of “base assets” bitcoin and ether allowing more investors to feel bullish about experimenting with defi and the  pandemic causing more people to find themselves indoors with time on their hands this activity fuelled acrosstheboard asset price increases and in turn only created greater enthusiasm among userssee also cryptocurrencies and us securities laws beyond bitcoin and etherthis rapid growth in va activity through the use of defi protocols without a readily identifiable intermediary to be subject to amlkyc compliance obligations may have caught fatf off guard defi protocols generally operate in as frictionless a manner as possible and very few of these protocols are programmed to provide any sort of automated kycaml compliance checks in fact it is the opposite – most of these protocols allow users to interact with the protocols without any checks or identification whatsoeverthis raised a critical question for fatf what would become of financial compliance if significant financial activity shifted to decentralised financethe draft guidance provides a simple answer there is no such thing as “decentralised finance” introducing fatf’s revised position the draft guidance states “where customers can access a financial service it stands to reason that some party has provided that financial service even if the act of providing it was temporary or shared among multiple parties” the draft guidance then expounds on this idea in greater detailthe determination of whether a service provider meets the definition of a vasp should take into account the lifecycle of products and services launching a service that will provide vasp services for instance does not relieve a provider of vasp obligations even if those functions will proceed automatically in the future especially but not exclusively if the provider will continue to collect fees or realize profits regardless of whether the profits are direct gains or indirect the use of an automated process such as a smart contract to carry out vasp functions does not relieve the controlling party of responsibility for vasp obligations for purposes of determining vasp status launching a selfpropelling infrastructure to offer vasp services is the same as offering them and similarly commissioning others to build the elements of an infrastructure is the same as building themthe fatf’s position here amounts to a very dramatic shot across the bow to the defi community if you are building the codebase for a defi protocol you intend to exploit or if you are otherwise directly or indirectly economically benefiting from that codebase then if the draft guidance is finalised in largely its current form and then adopted at the national level you likely will be considered a vasp once you are considered a vasp you would then be subject to the full range of compliance obligations that a centralised entity be it a traditional financial institution such as a bank or brokerdealer or a centralised digital asset exchange or custodian would havethis would mean that not only would an identifiable person or entity be required to conduct amlkyc checks on the person that controls each blockchain address that interacts with the defi protocol but also that sanctions checks – a notoriously tricky exercise that frequently produces false positives due to subtle differences in the spelling of individuals’ names – would also need to be conducteda determination would need to be made for each transaction as to whether a suspicious transaction report or the equivalent would need to be created and submitted to the appropriate authority a qualitative riskbased customer due diligence exercise would need to be conducted on the persons using the protocol and the protocol’s vasp would need to consider whether they are dealing with other vasps such that they have entered into the equivalent of a correspondent banking relationship with that vasp and then conduct a riskbased diligence exercise on that other vaspthe vasp for the defi protocol would also need to figure out how to implement the travel rule a requirement designed for wire transfers between traditional financial institutions where information about the sender and recipient is tracked by the financial institutions processing the transfer and available to law enforcement and financial intelligence units among others in the united states these new vasps would likely need to obtain money transmission licenses in a large number of statesalthough some of these requirements could in theory – at least to some extent – be provided in an automated manner consistent with the draft guidance there are at least three fundamental problems first large stores of personal data about the actual persons or businesses conducting the transactions will have to be stored somewhere opening up the possibility of a cure worse than the disease – a major breach of these data stores a particular risk if compliance is being implemented through the use of rapidly assembled automation platforms that haven’t been robustly tested second many of fatf’s recommendations being intended for centralised entities have judgmental elements that are simply not possible to implement with automation hence the apparent death knell for defisee also uk ban on cryptocurrency derivatives may stifle innovationfinally as the draft guidance is framed there could easily be multiple nonaffiliated persons or entities that would be considered a vasp with respect to any given defi protocol the draft guidance gives no clue about how these multiple vasps for the same protocol are meant to coordinate with each otherimpact on traditional and decentralised financeprior to the release of the draft guidance there was a reasonably clear correspondence between the responsibilities imposed on traditional financial institutions and those imposed on centralised businesses operating in the va space although there are not insignificant costs involved in developing and maintaining a compliance programme consistent with the national implementations of fatf’s recommendations there is no practical reason why the fatf recommendations could not be adopted by vasps that operate on a centralised basis likewise as traditional financial institutions increase their engagement with vas it will be relatively straightforward for these entities to complement their existing compliance programs with additional elements designed specifically for their dealing in vasthe same is not true for the new class of inadvertent vasps that would be created by implementation of the draft guidelines these are individuals or businesses that helped to create defi protocols who otherwise benefit economically or who effectively control these protocols often through the ownership of governance tokens whether an individual or a business these persons very likely do not have either the economic wherewithal or the needed technical expertise to fulfil the obligations of vaspsee also secs peirce says it is time to reconsider us crypto approachmoreover there are many practical questions that immediately arise when attempting to apply compliance requirements on these otherwise unsuspecting persons for example as noted above there could be more than one vasp for any given defi protocol for example any holder of governance tokens could be considered a vasp under the draft guidance how would the requirements apply to these multiple entities might one or more of these inadvertent vasps cease being a vasp with respect to the protocol at some point would selling your governance tokens mean that you were no longer a vasp if you bought some or all of the tokens back would you become a vasp again if so what does all this mean for recordkeeping and reporting by these inadvertent vaspsin addition fatf’s overall recommendations are clearly intended to apply to institutions that are able to employ a chief compliance officer among many other things how would a single individual comply what penalties would apply to an individual for failing to comply finally what about defi protocols that have already been created and are operational but not otherwise in compliance and unlikely to change that status – would these be grandfathered in some way or would there have to be a wave of lookback enforcement actionsone might initially expect that the net result of the above situation which might broadly be categorised under “it’s a mess” would be to discourage the creation and maintenance of new defi protocols full stop and ensure that most if not all activity with vas eventually takes place using centralized services this would of course address the fatf’s concerns about how to migrate their existing compliance framework originally designed for the fiat financial system into the world of vas this outcome would likely also suit traditional financial institutions many of which initially steered wide of permissionless blockchain networks and the digital assets they host and instead leaned into the much safer idea that the future of blockchain technology was in permissioned networks and distributed ledger technology dlt these institutions are now playing catchup as they explore how to provide services involving a wide range of digital assetshowever the defi genie may not head back into the traditional finance bottle quite so easily the availability of interoperable composable and transparently deterministic decentralised finance protocols has struck a major chord around the world the interest in defi extends well past “crypto” aficionados traders bankers and investors from the world of traditional finance are daily discovering defi and abandoning traditional roles to help be a part of the defi revolutioninstitutional funding is streaming into the space funding all manner of experimentation and research teams of only two or three skilled developers can create innovative and popular new protocols in a mere manner of months word of new protocols spreads virally among a devoted and wellinformed community without the need for traditional marketing budgets and external advertising agenciesrecognizing that defi is still in its infancy participants readily acknowledge the risks involved but maintain that more centralised regulation is not the answer instead proponents point to the remarkable level of transparency inherent in defi protocols as a major advantage over traditional financial services where regulators can watch the transactions occurring on defi protocols in real time as they occur supervision of traditional finance is frequently a matter of “closing barn doors” – regulators generally only get data after the underlying transactions have occurredmoreover one of most significant apparent drawbacks of defi – the fact that activity is extremely capital intensive due to the required overcollateralization of most activity especially when compared with the equivalent activity in traditional finance – has been addressed in a very defi way demand for credit in defi has led to the development of a vibrant onchain lending market in which participants in defi transactions can borrow through other defi protocols hedging platforms and even protocols that resemble insurance are rapidly coming onlinethe nft wildcardone almost completely unforeseen development over the last several months has been the exponential increase in the awareness of and interest in nonfungible tokens nfts popularity has grown significantly among the general public – so much so that the widely distributed us television programme saturday night live recently featured a skit on nftsnfts are unique blockchainbased digital assets that can reference artworks video content such as sports highlights music files magazine covers or virtually anything else nfts allow the owner to assert a special relationship with the underlying asset – much like having an autographed sports card however because nfts are built using composable smart contract code there is much more they can do including changing the underlying asset referenced upon transfer or reacting to the geolocation associated with the wallet address in which the nft is held although nfts are not inherently part of the defi landscape their compatibility with the many defi protocols already deployed and coming online means that they can be implemented in many ways recently the latest version of the uniswap digital asset exchange protocol known as  implemented nfts many other uses are anticipated over the coming monthsfatf nodded toward nfts in the draft guidance stating thatflexibility is particularly relevant in the context of vas and va activities which involve a range of products and services in a rapidlyevolving space some items—or tokens—that on their face do not appear to constitute vas may in fact be vas that enable the transfer or exchange of value or facilitate  secondary markets also exist in both the securities and commodities sectors for “goods and services” that are fungible and transferable for example users can develop and purchase certain virtual items that act as a store of value and in fact accrue value or worth and that can be sold for value in the va spacealthough this observation is not surprising – traditional artworks have acted as a readily transferable store of value for many years and have likewise been used as part of the financing illicit activities for equally long physical artworks must be handled by identifiable entities that may be subject to the fatf recommendations nfts are another matter altogether they are highly liquid and can be easily transferred without intermediaries demonstrating the challenges of attempting to import the traditional antimoney laundering framework into the realm of digital assetssee also middle east crypto industry faces obstaclesnfts move fluidly among owners or decentralised protocols transferring value at one moment looking like a simple collectible at another because of their programmability nfts can even shapeshift depending on the type of wallet in which they are stored imposing vasp status on anyone operating an nft platform simply because virtually all nfts have an inherent possibility of being used as a store of value may simply be a bridge too far for financial regulators in terms of achieving acceptance from the general public yet failing to do so exposes an obvious exploitable loophole to consistent financial regulatory policya way forwardmany fatf observers believe that regardless of the input received during the consultation period the final version of the vasp recommendations will likely closely resemble the draft guidance that will leave it to national financial sector regulators to determine how best to implement fatf’s recommendations in the context of their local regulatory frameworks in the united states that brings attention to the treasury department’s financial crimes enforcement network fincen the robust dialogue between the major participants in the centralised digital asset space in the us particularly digital asset exchanges and fincen will be joined by all those interested in maintaining a viable defi ecosystem it is harder to predict how these implementation discussions will play outthat said there is hope that many in the public sector will recognise the importance of allowing defi to grow and develop along with a potential for being used for illicit activities it also has advantages from a regulatory perspective over the traditional financial system which has suffered many “black eyes” over the past several years as a result of failing to prevent numerous significant cases of misuse in support of the financing of illicit activityat the same time many defi proponents recognise that wholly unfettered defi protocols are invitations to abusive use by bad actors the fact that little problematic activity in defi is known to have occurred at any significant scale so far may be attributed to the relative novelty of these protocols and the many practical risks still involved using them criminals probably don’t like losing money through poorly audited smart contract code either now is the time to find appropriate compromises – before a major amlcft incident on a defi platform occursone possibility is for fatf or national regulators to accept a more bifurcated approach to regulating the use of defi protocols this could mean recognition that companies that develop manage and benefit from centralised onramps websites providing userfriendly interfaces for defi protocol software will be treated as vasps or perhaps a slimmed down version of vasp in order to facilitate the wider use of defi protocols while still allowing cryptonative sophisticates who do not need a slick user interface experience to continue to access the command line smart contract code for defi protocols without engaging with intermediaries or otherwise being considered a vaspcritically in this approach fatf would also recognise that simply owning governance tokens for a defi platform would not cause each holder to potentially be considered a vasp with respect to the platform even if the governance token entitled the holder to a portion of the trading or other revenue or fees generated by the protocol at the same time defi protocol developers would be expected to implement the best available automated kyc software to limit the potential for misusein addition in this model individuals and businesses that are acting on behalf of themselves on a proprietary basis as opposed to investing thirdparty funds would not be subject to a penalty if they accessed the underlying command line smart contract code for defi protocols but anyone managing money or other value for others would be required to go through a vaspoperated onramplike most compromises such an outcome might not completely satisfy either financial regulators or diehard defi enthusiasts but it might just provide a possible alternative to the apparently untenable position currently found in the draft guidance©  euromoney institutional investor plc for help
