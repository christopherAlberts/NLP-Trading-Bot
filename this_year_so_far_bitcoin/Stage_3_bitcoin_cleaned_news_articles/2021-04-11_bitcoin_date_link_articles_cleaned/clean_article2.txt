bitcoin cryptobtc is by far the largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of about  trillion but many experts believe theres still a tremendous growth opportunity here in this fool live video clip recorded on march  aaron bush head of the motley fools extreme opportunities franchise asks dan morehead ceo of pantera capital just how big the bitcoin opportunity isaaron bush what is your view on bitcoin today and what do you think the opportunity is from here youve already teased order of magnitude but maybe to connect into this what do you think is still misunderstood about bitcoin today that lends itself to have that order of magnitudedan morehead well the thing i would say is i think its just not understood by enough people yet as i mentioned when i started investing in it there was maybe  people using maybe there are  million people now but theres still several billion people that dont have any exposure to bitcoin they dont really know about it what i found over the years of financializing this new asset class is there really isnt any wellwritten articulate paper that is negative on bitcoin and thats the holy grail i have been asking people for that for years is id love to see an intelligent person write a lengthy paper on why bitcoin is wrong or a failure and not a good investment thats really the punchline  there isnt that you occasionally get soundbites or something like that but no one actually ever writes a very long negative piece on that thats basically what happens is that the capture rate on people is so high that once someone actually spends a few days reads about it thinks about it they normally would end up buying some and thats whats been driving the pricing up for  yearswhat do i think about bitcoin now its been going up at a compound annual growth rate of  for  years again ive never seen an asset like that its just off the charts it does have some bubbles and it has had some crazy bear markets but if you graph the price exponentially over the last  years it looks pretty consistent again it occasionally gets ahead of itself it occasionally gets behind right now although its rallied a lot since the pandemic lows a year ago its still below its longterm trend line i think bitcoin is fairly valued its certainly not a bubble right now i think it can go up quite a bitwe have a bunch of things coming together at the same time the tax being built out for the last  years that story is on track its great but the two big things that happened recently is the monetary stimulus response to the virus is literally off the charts the us now prints more money every month than it did in the first  years of its existence that has to increase the price of things where quantity cant be eased it just thats the way it works if you print trillions of dollars of new pieces of paper money its going to take more money to buy things like gold or bitcoin or even the sp  that to my mind is the best proof of our thesis here that the unlimited printing of money is going to increase the price in that paper money of things that cant be increased the sp has had a huge to earnings because obviously the pandemic has caused enormous financial damage to companies but the price of the sp  is way up thats just because theres so much money sloshing around its driving up the price of bitcoin its driving up the price of ethereum cryptoeth and all the other blockchains right at the same time were making it much easier for both individuals and institutions to get exposure a long time ago it was really hard you had to take a selfie with your passport and send it to an exchange and wait for a week to get approved and all that stuff now paypal nasdaqpypl has just turned on  million people and they can buy bitcoin with a click so its just a lot easier to get exposure i think over the next six or eight months you can see major wall street firms turn on their wealth management platform to allow high net worth individuals to buy bitcoin all those things are going to drive the price up
