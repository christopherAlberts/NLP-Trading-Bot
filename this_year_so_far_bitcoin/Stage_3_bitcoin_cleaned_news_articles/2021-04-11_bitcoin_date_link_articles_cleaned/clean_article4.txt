bitcoin cryptobtc is the largest cryptocurrency in the market but with a total market value of about  billion secondlargest digital asset ethereum cryptoeth isnt exactly tiny itself while these are both forms of the same general asset class there are some major differences between the two in this fool live video clip recorded on march  senior analyst john rotonti and motley fool deutschland lead analyst bernd schmid discuss the key differences investors should be aware ofjohn rotonti there are other cryptocurrencies one of the ones that i hear the most about is ethereum what are the differences between bitcoin and ethereum or bitcoin and other cryptocurrenciesbernd schmid this is a great question and very difficult to answer nonetheless for me i am an engineer actually and even now im trying to frame it from an investment perspective ethereum is also based on a blockchain im not sure if you could call it the cryptocurrency if its a currency or not what is a currency ethereum was designed about six or seven years ago i think   if im not mistaken based on the idea bitcoin is great but i would like to make this programmable for example i would like to make an automatic program a code which is like you want to borrow me some bitcoin we have to orally agree and we have to sign an agreement or something like this the creator for ethereum was thinking hey why dont we just make this as a code on the blockchain when both people agree to borrow bitcoin that this will be recorded on the blockchain and the transfer happens automatically so the whole process will be automated i think this was the main idea behind ethereum and ethereum is actually more like a platform its a platform for building such kind of contract like i was just describing like lending contracts or you could build decentralized exchanges like completely automated like you have an exchange which is running just based on code on the ethereum blockchain so to say this is what ethereum was designed for you could theoretically do the same thing with bitcoin or these things could be delivered with bitcoin the bitcoin community the guys who run the notes right now at least they want to keep bitcoin basic they dont want to add functionality so bitcoin is just useful currently as buying it storing it and transferring it to somebody else you cannot do much more with it on the bitcoin network
