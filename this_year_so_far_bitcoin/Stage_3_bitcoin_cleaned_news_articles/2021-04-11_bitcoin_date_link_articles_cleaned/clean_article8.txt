when bitcoin was first introduced it had little to no value early adopters traded thousands of bitcoin for just a few dollars until the infamous “pizza day” incident when laszlo hanyecz paid  btc for two large pizzas setting in motion a chain of events that lead to bitcoin’s value growing from a few cents to nearly  in just over a decadebitcoin has come a long way since then with large corporate institutions spending years denying its value as an investable asset only to turn around and start investing in it themselves recently paypal introduced bitcoin as a payment method with millions of merchants that use its platform celebrities like paris hilton joined the community and it seems that bitcoin is poised for even more growthby analyzing bitcoin’s past performance it’s not impossible to get an idea of where its value is set to go next although many analysts and influencers alike have made bold predictions — like bitcoin growing to as much as  million — i thought it would be best to take a look for ourselves by analyzing each halving epoch that is bitcoin’s performance between each halving eventthe chart below explores bitcoin’s value over the last  years in four separate sections called the halving epochsthe chart was inspired by a similar one i recently came across which lacked any projections that i felt necessary to predict where bitcoin is heading next as mentioned on the chart each epoch is  times larger than the previous one and covers the times between each halving event when analyzing and comparing each epoch a clear trend emergesepoch  genesis block  to first halving in the first epoch bitcoin found its footing after first being released by satoshi nakamoto in  it took several months to see early adopters come on board and a dollarbased value be established with laszlo hanyecz’s  btc pizzas cementing its price during this time bitcoin saw its value rise from  to as high as  with early use limited to trading over forums and early limited exchangesepoch  first halving  to second halving in the second epoch bitcoin started to see further adoption although the infamous mt gox exchange was founded in  already and had seen some controversy in  with several hacks by  and early  it was handling as much as  percent of all bitcoin transactions before the infamous hack that saw it shut down and bitcoin seeing a large drop in value as thousands of bitcoins were stolen then there was the infamous silk road and silk road  platforms which led the media to associate bitcoin with illegal activities during the second epoch bitcoin’s value traded for as low as  to a high of epoch  third halving  to fourth halving by the third epoch bitcoin had seen its adoption grow to new highs the world’s largest investors and institutions were finally taking notice with many changing their opinions on bitcoin as a decent asset and good store of value bitcoin’s run from a low of  to its famous peak of  in late  was widely reported as was the subsequent plunge in value although it became clear that bitcoin trading was volatile asset managers and the average joe alike took notice of bitcoin as an assetepoch  fourth halving  to fifth halving second half of we currently find ourselves in the fourth epoch public companies such as microstrategy and tesla have added bitcoin to their balance sheets new highs are being reached almost monthly and reputable investors suggest it could go as high as  million sometime in the near future if bitcoin follows the same trajectory as the last epoch i predict that it may very well reach a high of over  before once again seeing an almost sudden plunge in value as investors try to reap as high a profit as possible if bitcoin does indeed follow this trajectory i believe we may see a massive new high before the end of the pattern and what the future holdsit is evident that each time a halving occurs in due time bitcoin sees a dramatic surge to a new alltime high beyond many expectations as soon as this peak arrives many start to sell their investments to reap the profits with bitcoin then seeing a plunge as dramatic as the surge that came before it bitcoin’s value sees regular pumps followed by regular dumps until it eventually stabilizes with a new bottom for some months it trades relatively sideways until a second surge begins it isn’t however as dramatic as the one before but it does push bitcoin’s value high enough to see it reach at least half its previous alltime high before the next halvingit is likely many of the large institutions and investors that have bought millions worth of bitcoin over the last few years will sell off their holdings once bitcoin reaches a high enough value the same can be said about miners who have started accumulating their newly mined coins instead of selling them in this case bitcoin should peak somewhere between  and  if we follow the same trend during this epoch as the last it could take months maybe even a year before bitcoin sees this new high but i believe we’re heading there sometime later this yearone concern that is quite evident is that more and more publicly traded companies are adding bitcoin to their balance sheet this is great in terms of adoption and legitimizing bitcoin as an asset however these companies have shareholders and it is very likely that a company like microstrategy that holds billions of dollars worth of bitcoin will see an activist shareholder or two jump on board and push it to sell off its holdings should it reach a massive new high as predicted abovelet’s continue to look at microstrategy as an example they hold over  bitcoin currently worth north of  billion with the company’s market cap being just over  billion should bitcoin reach a high of  it would value their bitcoin holdings over  billion and with blackrock morgan stanley and vanguard owning over  percent of the company’s shares they are likely to push them to sell as soon as possible and return value to shareholders that’s over  bitcoin that could flood the market the same could happen at many other public companies and threatens not just bitcoin’s price but trust in it as a storage of valuewhat remains clear looking at the chart above is that bitcoin has proved time and time again that it is a trustworthy asset and store of value it sees surges and plunges and it is likely to happen for several years to come bitcoin is by no means near its peak and even though it may take a few years bitcoin is poised for tremendous growth and will continue to see largescale adoption as it
