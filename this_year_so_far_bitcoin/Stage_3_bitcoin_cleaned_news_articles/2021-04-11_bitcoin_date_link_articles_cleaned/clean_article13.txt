showing that people are expecting this to continue that they’re not expecting rates to come down any time soon” griffiths said the container carriers “are going into this in a significant position of strength” he saidso snarled are the nation’s supply channels that they’ve caught the attention of federal reserve officials who are trying to set monetary policy based on the speed of the us recovery and the outlook for inflationwhile there are signs of solid factory activity in the coming months “reports of shortages in materials and labor as well as bottlenecks in transportation signaled some potential restraints on the pace of the manufacturing recovery” according to minutes released wednesday of the central bank’s federal open market committee meeting on march “we’re going to have a

thanks to the size of their orders smaller ones however are at the mercy of spot rates and price increases“especially if you’re not in a really big shipper that has a very sophisticated negotiating process and a lot of leverage you’re forced to accept these contracts” downes saidfor example price hikes and surcharges imposed on the smaller businesses that use spot rates can be attributed to anything from weather and ship congestion to the cost of fuel and raw materialskamler said clauses in his contracts have let the container carriers charge premiums during the peak season which he
