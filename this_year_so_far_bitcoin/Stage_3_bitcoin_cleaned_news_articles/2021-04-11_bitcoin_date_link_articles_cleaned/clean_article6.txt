the last year has been a wild one for growth investors two of the financial worlds biggest stories over the last  months have been bitcoins incredible rally and the success of cathie woods ark invest company and its growthfocused exchangetraded funds etfs the value of a single bitcoin has risen roughly  over the last year and is currently at  meanwhile the value of the ark innovation etf has risen roughly  across the same stretch a highly impressive performance in its own rightbitcoin has crushed it over the last year however three motley fool contributors have identified some stocks held within woods premier etf that look primed to outperform bitcoin read on to see why they think that sea limited nysese paypal nasdaqpypl and square nysesq have what it takes to outperform the markets leading cryptocurrencytapping into big growth trendskeith noonan sea limited bitcoins run over the last year has been nothing short of incredible and woods ark invest has taken bullish positions in the crypto space that have come to look prescient with hindsight its possible that bitcoin has more huge gains ahead and the coin has certainly far outperformed where i thought it would be over the last year however i generally stick to the peter lynch invest in what you know approach and the difficulty i have mapping out why bitcoin should go up or down means there are growth stocks held in ark funds that i find more appealingits not that i havent looked into bitcoin ive read and heard about its  million hard coin supply cap hash rates the lightning network and the related critiques of fiat currency that underpin many arguments for new digital assets my investing focus skews toward growth stocks that are riskier than the market at large but at the end of the day i just dont have a great case for why bitcoin should be worth more one year from now  particularly when there are other cryptocurrencies that offer superior functionality in many respectswhile im not super bullish on bitcoin or the arkfavored grayscale bitcoin trust otcgbtc there are stocks in the companys actively managed etfs that are right up my ally sea limited for example is the fifthlargest holding in the ark innovation etf and i plan on adding the stock to my portfolio in the near future the singaporebased tech company has posted stellar gains over the last year and it appears to be on track to deliver more big winssea operates at the intersection of two industries with huge longterm growth potential ecommerce and interactive entertainment its shopee platform has established a leadership position in southeast asias fastgrowing online retail industry and its garena free fire is one of the worlds topgrossing video gamessoutheast asia is a geographic market that looks poised for rapid development over the next decade and sea has established ecommerce and entertainment offerings that are primed to benefit from macroeconomic and category growth i wouldnt place bets against bitcoin but strong players in the ecommerce and gaming markets currently look like better buys to meactively managed leaves a lot of doors openjames brumley paypal look i know woods ark next generation internet etf nysemktarkw has a huge stake in grayscale bitcoin trust which is an easier way to trade the cryptocurrency than buying and selling bitcoin itself a few other ark funds hold a stake in the same trustfor a lot of investors though arks position in so much bitcoin is a bit misleadingsee ark funds are actively managed exchangetraded funds which by definition means wood and her fund managers will sell them when it looks like theres no upside left as such these stakes are more of a speculative trade and less of an actual commitment to the premise of cryptocurrency they only have value to any ark fund as long as theyre growing at an arbitrary price but instability is one of the last things you want in any currencythats not to suggest theres something wrong with a little speculating but if youre going to make serious investment bets it just makes so much more sense to start  and maybe even finish  with names you can make at least some sort of earningsbased and growthbased assessment oftake paypal as an example and an alternative woods ark fintech innovation etf nysemktarkf as well as the ark next generation internet etf sold off a bunch of paypal shares recently its still the fintech funds fourthbiggest holding though making it clear that wood and her management team see something in it i suspect this years and next years projected revenue growth of  is a key factor its a growth outlook that simply doesnt exist for bitcointhis fintech has multiple ways to windavid butler square wood focuses heavily on tech investing in her strategy definitely provides the speculation and big potential returns that those interested in cryptocurrencies covet so dearly overall the heavy focus on tech is a bit too concentrated for my tastes as a shift in sector trends could be significantly troublesome that being said wood has created some great gains in her ark innovation etf and there are lessons to be learned from itamong woods largest holdings i like square because of its strategic positioning within ecommerce because its services allow businesses to create online stores easily and link it all with their inventory and marketing square serves as a middle man for all kinds of different industries the companys suite of mobile payment software offers a great deal of utility to the customer annual revenue growth has been strong but  was certainly the biggest year for the company sales doubled to  billion with earnings more than doubling to  per diluted sharethe one catch of course is valuation as with most of these rapidly growing tech names square is not cheap trading at over  times last years earnings this one is all about the future and the big premiums are no different than investing in something as unbelievably speculative as bitcoin square offers utility what does bitcoin currently offer outside of serving as an artificial digital commodity
