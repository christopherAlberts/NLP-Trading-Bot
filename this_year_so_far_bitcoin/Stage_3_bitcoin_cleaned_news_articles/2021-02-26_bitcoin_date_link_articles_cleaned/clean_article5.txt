what role should bitcoin play in retirees’ and nearretirees’ portfoliosthere is no doubt that its allure is overwhelming the cryptocurrency has gained more than  just since the beginning of this year and is up more than  over the last  months returns like that would go a long way toward restoring underfunded retirement portfoliosin fact many retirees and nearretirees have already invested in bitcoin a recent poll conducted by devere group of clients over the age of  found that “ of those surveyed are already invested in digital currencies or are planning to do so this year”they need to tread carefully however—very carefully bitcoin’s price is so volatile that it is inappropriate for any portion of their retirement portfolios except that with which they are able to speculate with abandon—their play money in other wordsconsider the standard deviation of bitcoin’s monthly returns since the beginning of  it is an incredible  those of you who remember your statistics  will immediately realize what this means assuming the future is like the past you can expect  of its monthly returns to fall within a range that is two standard deviations above or below its mean—a range that is more than  percentage pointsnote carefully that this is the expected range for monthly returns unless you are addicted to risk you shouldn’t be trying to finance your basic living expenses in retirement with an asset this volatileto put bitcoin’s volatility in perspective consider that the standard deviation of gold’s monthly returns over the same period  that therefore means that assuming the future is like the past we can expect  of gold’s future monthly returns to fall within a range that is  percentage points above or below its monthly mean—a total range of  percentage points most of us would consider that to itself be risky but it seems like child’s play compared with bitcoin’scrash riskhuge volatility is not the only thing that retirees and nearretirees need to keep in mind when considering bitcoin for their retirement portfolios another is the notinsignificant chance that its price will crash within the next two yearsin making this prediction i am following the lead of an academic study entitled “bubbles for fama” which appeared several years ago in the journal of financial economics its authors were robin greenwood a finance and banking professor at harvard business school and chair of its behavioral finance and financial stability project andrei shleifer an economics professor at harvard university and yang you a phd candidate at that institutionthe researchers defined a crash as a  drop within a twoyear period they found that when an industry or sector beat the market by  or more over the trailing two years the odds of it crashing were  when the trailing twoyear return relative to the market rose to at least  that crash probability rose to  and when the trailing twoyear return rose to even more than that a crash became almost inevitablebitcoin’s trailing twoyear return is over ask yourself how much of your retirement financial security are you willing to bet on an asset for which there is a significant likelihood of crashing to all but those most addicted to risk that is an unacceptably high price to pay for the excitement of investing in bitcoinbitcoin’s ‘fair value’you might nevertheless be willing to incur bitcoin’s extraordinary volatility and crash risk so long as its longterm trend is strongly upward and many argue that it is but there also are good reasons for doubtconsider research conducted last year by claude erb a former commodities portfolio manager at tcw group he analyzed a number of different possible theories for estimating bitcoin’s fair value and found that the one that most closely fits the historical data is one that bases it on its socalled “network effect” such an effect would be related to what’s referred to as metcalfe’s law which holds that a network’s value grows according to the square of the number of usersthe predictions of this theory are plotted in the accompanying chart to construct it erb assumed that each bitcoin that has been mined represents one user in a bitcoin network its fair value at any given time is a function of the number of bitcoins that have been mined up to that point according to that theory bitcoin’s fair value right now is below erb’s model also allows us to calculate bitcoin’s future potential given that its underlying code stipulates that no more than  million of them will ever exist and this limit isn’t likely to be reached until  that translates to a bitcoin price of  relative to its current price that represents a  annualized return over the next  yearsretirement portfolio asset allocationdoes this discussion leave any room for bitcoin in your retirement portfolio the answer depends on whether that portfolio already provides a closetoguaranteed support for whatever minimum standard of living you have set for your retirement only insofar as your minimum needs have been met should you even consider something as risky as bitcointhis conclusion might seem harsh but it applies to all risky assets not just bitcoin as i argued a week ago in pointing out that risk grows with investment horizon “only after  basic needs are met  should  consider going further out on the risk spectrum”mark hulbert is a
