jim surowiecki calls it a failed currency aaron bush calls it the ultimate rule breaker who is right could it be both in this episode of rule breaker investing motley fool cofounder david gardner is joined by these two cryptoluminaries to talk about bitcointo catch full episodes of all the motley fools free podcasts check out our podcast center to get started investing check out our quickstart guide to investing in stocks a full transcript follows the videothis video was recorded on february  david gardner ive had lots of fans scripting the opens to my show for years now it started when guest star priya parker author of the art of gathering joined me on this podcast a few summers ago and reminded us to never start a funeral with logistics by which she meant that the moment at the start of a gathering or podcast and the moments at the end those are the real moments that matter and so put extra effort into them dont tell the people gathered at a memorial service at its very start dont lead off with someone left their lights on in level  of the parking garage and their license plate is blahdiblahdiblah dont do that youll lose such a key opportunity from that following weeks podcast onward for years now i have made a point of prescripting what i say to you upfront each week its what im doing right now well whats ahead this week i dont know that this weeks topic needs any further introduction than just its name bitcoin only on this weeks rule breaker investingwelcome back to rule breaker investing thinking back to that priya parker interview im reminded one week after we just brought you blast from the past that that was a wonderful blast from the past in fact i highly recommend googling rule breaker investing art of gathering and going back and listening to that blast from the past if you hadnt previously encountered it anyway that was then and this is now i am delighted this week to be joined by two of my favorite people helping me and you think about the future and maybe how it informs the present that were all living through if were talking of the present of bitcoin and the many things tied to it today the skyhigh price that it has achieved in the markets mind in recent weeks and months and all of the implications of that im delighted to be joined this week by my longtime friend jim surowiecki and my longtime coworker aaron bush they are my two guest stars to discuss bitcoin with you this week jim is the author of the book the wisdom of crowds he writes a business column for marker he blogs at surowieckimediumcom now you may not know how to spell surowiecki im going to do it for you right now because i think jims worth reading his last name is spelled suro thats the easy part wiecki so surowieckimediumcom where he blogs he wrote for many years the financial page for the new yorker and in an earlier life he was a motley fool employee helping us figure out the internet in early dayslongtime friend jim surowiecki is joining my friend aaron bush aaron is  on twitter he is an investor at large at the motley fool where hes been an analyst and friend for years now hes previously been on this podcast numerous times winning the market cap game show where helping us understand bitcoin hes also a founder of his own research effort in the world of video games and thats masterthemetacom i want to get these introductions out of the way so we can start our conversation i also want you to know having already done this conversation im taping this portion after it that the sound quality at points is not up to snuff for this podcast for a very understandable reason we were not operating with our normal technology in place aaron himself in texas anybody heard about the weather in texas this week his electricity came on literally five minutes before we started recording which made it awfully helpful to do a podcast together and jim also worked from his own home office while some of the sound quality and what youre going to experience together is maybe below the standard i think the thought quality is well above the standard this week for rule breaker investing i want to thank my guests for bringing their fool selves to share with you today as we discuss bitcoinaaron lets begin with you and the proverbial alien visiting from another planet question aaron im an alien from another planet take me to your leader but if you cant perhaps you can answer me this what are these cryptocurrencies ive been hearing about from you humans and what is bitcoinaaron bush well first of all if we have aliens visiting we probably have bigger problems on our hands  but if i were inclined to start talking about crypto i mean i guess i would start by saying its magic internet money thats probably the simplest way to put it but more seriously cryptocurrency is digital currency or just internet money in which transactions are verified and records are maintained in a decentralized way using cryptography instead of having some centralized authority typically a government in control of that system as we as a society become more digitally immersed the ways that we make and store and use money become increasingly digital as well cryptocurrency which on the internet is essentially programmable money its an evolution of money for our increasingly digital world it can be designed and used in multiple kinds of ways one kind of which is bitcoin which is the first and largest cryptocurrency still in its case the currency part of cryptocurrency might be a misnomer maybe we can talk a bit about that later and maybe its best compared to something like digital gold with other longterm optionality but of course there are other types of cryptocurrency not everything works exactly like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might serve other purposes or act as foundational platforms that others can build apps and services on top of i dont think we need to get too into the weeds on that right now but generally thats how i think about what cryptocurrency isgardner well again thank you as an alien to your planet i want you to know first of all i come in peace please dont make the assumption that im coming after your anything but i did read some of your species history and i understand that originally money was a form of receipt it was basically grain stored in granaries in sumer then somebody thought well rather than just be a store of value what if we started making it tradable so metals came in thats my understanding of your species and what youve been doing ever since then now it sounds like technology is now advanced to the point where its invisible and yet it still can function the same way but i remain a little confused im going to turn to my friend jim surowiecki in a second i remain a little confused as to whether these cryptocurrencies this bitcoin is supposed to be a currency that im spending or instead like grain in sumer thousands of years ago just a form of storage or receipt indeed jim surowiecki longtime friend and author of the venerated book the wisdom of crowds which by the way my nephew in college tells me is his assigned reading this term so youve already created a modern classic jim i say you wrote an article for marker last month i really enjoyed your article and your premise by the way im back to me now im no longer an alien your premise was that measured as a currency bitcoin you say has failed you went strong to the hoop with that word if currency jim by definition is a medium of exchange it seems it isnt used that way in any measurable manner in commercial transactions or consumer life today its been about a month since you wrote that article bitcoin has been volatile over that last month jim have your own thoughts been volatile or do you still believe what you wrote one month agojim surowiecki no i still believe what i wrote a month ago i dont know is it up to  today i think the piece i wrote came out right after it had gone to  then fallen back to  or something i think its up almost  since then just maybe more like  since then but no my opinion has not changed if anything the incredible volatility that we have seen and obviously its been good volatility for bitcoin holders in the sense that its gone up just confirms the basic premise of the article actually ive been writing about bitcoin it cracks me up ive written about bitcoin since gardner wowsurowiecki i always think to myself i wrote the first piece back it was called future of technology review i think it was  i always say to myself if i had just put  in  bitcoin then i mean literally if you think about it i mean its incredible how different my life would be but i didnt because even then i thought it was in a bubble and i dont even know what it was at the time but the bubble question is different this piece that i wrote was really about the fact that if you go back to the origins of bitcoin to the original white paper that was published the original design of it and maybe more importantly to the way people talked about it it was really talked about as something that people hoped would become a currency it would become a replacement for fiat money that is the governmentissued money and that you would use it to trade you would use it to buy and sell goods and services that was one of the big appeals of it from a conceptual point of view and it had a cyberpunk element to it i mean not in a bad way but in a historical sensei think what has happened over time is that its become very clear that thats not really what bitcoin is going to be used for i think mainly because of the way it was designed from the start but also because of the way its value has risen and fallen and risen and fallen its just way too volatile for people who use it to buy and sell goods and services both on the upside end and the downside i mean you dont want to buy something with bitcoin today if its going to be worth  more three weeks from now but alternatively you dont want to sell something with bitcoin if its going to be worth  less tomorrow maybe thats one of the reasons then i think theres also a reason we can get into if we want about the limited supply of bitcoin which was one of the greatest feels of it and i think it still is but that actually also made it very hard to work  in currency i think the combination of those things has turned it from a potential currency into and i think aarons phrase is right its essentially become a form of digital gold i think thats pretty much the way people see it when i wrote that piece i got a huge amount of pushback mainly because i think people thought i was saying bitcoin itself had failedgardner those headline writerssurowiecki yes definitely  but there was pushback and people were like no its still going to be used as a currency and i dont know i just dont see it i dont see itgardner jim im curious since youre one of the great intellectual live wires ive ever come across and i always enjoy hearing how your thought has progressed what would you say is the greatest similarity  years later to what you were thinking in  about bitcoin and what would you say is the greatest change in your thinkingsurowiecki i think back then i still was intrigued by the possibility of it becoming a true currency i was skeptical that was going to be easy and in fact the argument i made in that piece was paradoxically something i still believe which is that the only way for bitcoin to really become a currency was for it to essentially drop in value there are complicated arguments about whether thats true or not but the problem was as long as bitcoin kept escalating in value it was just going to be very hard for it to become a currency i still thought that was possible i dont think thats possible or likely at least anymore in terms of the basic similarities is that the design of bitcoin there are a limited number of bitcoins in  i cannot remember its going to reach its maximum number and no more bitcoins will ever be issued i think that creates an incredible incentive for people to hoard it rather than to spend it there are ways around that people have tried to find ways around it i think the core reality of bitcoin is that and so thats why i think it was always in some ways headed to where it has ended upgardner all right lets do a quick numerical accounting aaron im going to turn back to you now history will show that the rule breaker investing podcast last invited you on to talk about this subject on december   now that very weak bitcoin would jump from  to  that week one year later it was at  now it wouldnt get back to  again until wait for it literally december   that was exactly three years after i last had you on this podcast to talk about crypto and of course since then it has now risen in just the last few months from around  to around  which is where its priced today as we record the afternoon of february   aaron first of all this means i have a pension for having you on at times of extreme appreciation and pun intended and where things are a year later can sometimes be very different yet that dropped even from  to  of  back down to  seems possibly irrelevant now on the one hand now that with bitcoin at  but it was even a great buy at  if we think about it three years later even at its peak its almost a threebagger just over three years later aaron i believe when we caught up on this a few years ago you owned some bitcoinbush i still do i dont think i have spent it ive just been holding i wish i bought more at certain points but i have still been holding and it really is amazing to look back i think on one hand it was pretty bubbly at the time i do remember going to restaurants and listening to people  overhearing conversations david talking about crypto even i sometimes will be in those restaurants talking about crypto its part of my job and i would notice people listening in the tone of just individual investors was very much driven by fomo fear of missing out at the time i think it showed and the demand wasnt sustainable but i think over time we have seen that there actually is something to this bitcoin thing and it is a situation where some people would say that bitcoin doesnt have any intrinsic value but on the other hand its value is believed into existence over time and any type of value or i would even say any type of stability is an emergent property i think if you even look beyond just the threeyears ago that we talked about bitcoin you can almost see these cycles occur almost in a fractallike way when you zoom in you almost see the same chart that you do when you zoom out and these ups and downs have been recurringlooking forward it wouldnt surprise me again if we go through other depths i dont know if were there yet and i do think that the volatility will continue perhaps for decades from now its hard to say but i think what we have seen since then is more people believing that value into existence not just individual investors but also institutions now increasing the company i do think the narrative has changed a little bit from now until then plus just as cryptocurrency the whole ecosystem has started to mature a little bit more but it really is fascinating to look back and see how things have changed so quicklygardner well i want to talk some about storing value and i want to do it in the context of a stock a stock that i picked back in  rerecommended in  which had been a pretty perennial underperformer im sorry to say the ticker symbol mstr the company is microstrategy nasdaqmstr it is in the motley fool rule breakers service we had an unacceptable cost basis looked at from any eyes that were not in the last few months of about  a share in  it had gone up to  in  so i added to our winners but then it went sideways this business intelligence software company stock went sideways for years gentlemen i know your thought of the story but many others arent microstrategy not exactly a household name those two stock picks well the stock had settled around  by last fall ie i was down while the stock market has gone up over those five or six years now the stock has gone from about  to im seeing it at  here as we talk on tuesday afternoon this company has gone ballistic it is now a great winning stock pick for motley fool rule breaker members showing patiencenow why did this happen well this business intelligence software company has a maverick founder ceo michael saylor here in the greater dc area a wellknown and an increasingly wellknown guy he began to convert the balance sheet of his business intelligence software company the cash into bitcoins starting last summer i saw him tweeting out some and just talking about the importance of crypto oh my gosh if it isnt also the case jim surowiecki that i think the company has announced the secondary offering this week i think even today to issue more shares of microstrategy stock intended to be traded into bitcoin itself what is happening with microstrategysurowiecki well the funny thing i was thinking about as you were talking is i realized that i actually have no idea what microstrategys business has actually done over the last four years i remember michael saylor was a highprofile figure at the tailend of the internet bubble he was as you said a maverick and there was a lot of buzz around and then microstrategy went down there i cant imagine how low the stock got but he kept the company in business i have no idea what the actual business has done what i know is what you said that they invested in bitcoin i think as of today theyve made something like  billion on their investment in bitcoin so thats   dollarsgardner yeah well when you consider that the companys market cap as we speak is just shy of  billion considering that its up six times in a few months you can see that theyve made more money on their bitcoin investment than the market capital of the company four months agosurowiecki exactly thats been fascinating and obviously to some degree theres a fundamental response there there are responding fundamentals if you assume that investing in bitcoin can count as real money because he hasnt converted it back into dollars but lets assume that it is so there has been a response to the fundamentals but its also true that bitcoin has become a little bit of a magic word for investors or speculators depending on your perspective i dont know if you remember but there were those studies that were done of the late  that showed that companies that just added com to their name even if they didnt really have much to do with it got a bump automatically pretty much from investors at least temporarily and theres some of that theres some sense of if you talk about bitcoin and some people have said the same thing is true with tesla that if a company just decided it was going to invest its corporate shares in tesla it would immediately get a steep price theres some of that whats fascinating is what hes done today to say we are going to raise another  million and put more of it in its  now they can obviously invest it when they want but i think that suggests that hes serious about this on some level but it is a pretty extraordinary moment i mean theres nothing i can really think of thats similar to it in terms of companies using their corporate cash in this way its a fascinating experimentgardner i want to make it clear to everybody listening that im pretty neutral and just wanting to learn and to explore i think thats the tenor of our conversation from my standpoint aaron this is a stock pick ive made for rule breakers its a multiple recommendation for rule breaker members we have been beneficiaries of this aaron bush you own bitcoin yourself you are a beneficiary of this aaron should i recommend selling microstrategy sometime in the next month or so in cash in on our eightbagger or is this the start of something amazingbush i think the way i would think about it is should you sell microstrategy to buy bitcoin thats the question i would be asking whether in a vacuum whether to buy or sell microstrategy im honestly torn on this too because on one level it is  a business that is building technology and serving customers but its increasingly being hinged on bitcoin and its strange its hard for me to wrap my mind around a business being like this but i like the forward thinking about what bitcoin could represent and how they were able to get in early on it and for me as someone who is holding bitcoin id like to see that they are holding bitcoin too i dont know what i think about them raising money to buy more bitcoin and basically make themselves a bitcoin proxy of some sort that is strange to me but as a whole im intrigued by the experiment essentially thats going on over theresurowiecki aarons point is actually interesting in terms of why own microstrategy as opposed to why own bitcoin because there is something a little odd about it in a way you could argue that what microstrategy is doing is a little bit like what conglomerates did in the  when they would diversify away from their core businesses and come over to gulf oil whoever was bought montgomery ward or something the argument against that from a corporate finance point of view is always that investors can own montgomery ward if they want why should you buy it essentially with investor money its actually an inefficient form of diversification investors can diversify on their own and i think you could argue that here again i say that as someone who knows nothing about the status of microstrategys actual underlying business but you obviously thought it was good enough to tell people to invest in so maybe thats a way to do itbut i will say the other thing thats interesting about this from an investment point of view setting microstrategy a little bit aside although it gets into the diversification thing is one advantage that bitcoin has had over the last decade beyond the fact that it was the best performing asset class basically in the world is that it was almost completely uncorrelated with most other assets its movements essentially there was no correlation between them and what was happening in the stock market i dont know if thats changed over the last year or so but it evolved into where there was a diversification case for owning bitcoin which is odd and fascinating but i do think the idea of why do i want to own the stock that owns bitcoin rather than just owning it myself if we assume that microstrategy is relatively fairly valued and all these people are already reflecting it i think its actually a really interesting question maybe its an ease thing its easier to sell microstrategy than to well its not easier than to sell bitcoin so i dont know its an interesting questionbush i think what else is interesting about this is that there really isnt a good proxy for bitcoin unless you buy a bitcoin for example there is no bitcoin etf the sec has so far not allowed that i think thatll probably change in time there are a lot of people who might not want to figure out how to own bitcoin themselves but are interested in basically owning something in their same brokerage account that can be influenced the same way that bitcoin is and i think microstrategy has been clever in the sense of positioning themselves as a proxy it just reminds me of a term i think about occasionally which is reflexivity that just basically means that investors dont often base their decisions on reality but their perception of reality instead it boils down to what we think about reality especially when lots of people start piling it it actually affects reality itself in this case weve seen that  play out with microstrategy where by turning themselves into a bitcoin proxy theyre now able to raise  million more i dont know if theyre going to put all that into bitcoin or something else but the point of it is theyve allowed some reflexivity for themselves to get more flexibility to then reinvest in otherwise whether its bitcoin whether its acquiring something else or whether its reinvesting in their own business and helping them level up i think that is whats super interesting about this and that same reflexivity point can be applied to crypto at large in so many other wayssurowiecki i think microstrategy is down isnt microstrategy down  over the last week or month or something like that maybe im wronggardner yeah it hit a high of about  just a week or two ago again everything is volatile  having to do with bitcoin right now but as we speak the stock is right around  just short of  so jim its down  in the last  dayssurowiecki thats just interesting in the sense that its not moving completely in tandem with the price of bitcoin there is some separation there i dont know maybe it was insider selling in anticipation of this  million i dont know they shouldnt be doing that if thats what happened but it is interesting to wonder why theres been that disconnect i think the other thing that will be interesting will be if bitcoin well just say it goes back down to  where it was  three weeks ago or something like that how does microstrategys stock react to that i think that will be intriguing because on the one hand you think thatll be bad but if its going to spend  million it obviously wants the price to drop temporarily at leastgardner lets push microstrategy off to the side now for our conversation and just talk a little bit more you guys alluded to this earlier to some more of the institutional buy in that were seeing now the master of reflexivity of our time and its a concept that george soros has written a lot about i always think of soros aaron when i think of reflexivity but if you actually want to talk about the embodiment of it its elon musk somebody who can persuade people that an electric car can be real and then in so persuading he got the dollars to build it and then he made it real and then it changed the world it undermined the entire industry and it led to i think a better future and one of the greatest consumer products ive ever seen or ridden in thats reflexivitythe velveteen rabbit is loved into being if you love it it becomes real and its a real dynamic especially when it comes to microstrategy maybe the last time ill mention in this podcast is being able to do a secondary offering raising more money it couldnt have before or guys how about gamestop the prospect of another business where their stock ran up a lot because people wanted it to be real they also wanted to run the shorts out and i think they had a lot of fun although when youre having fun in real life with real companies it starts getting to be a more complex fun but whether were talking about running up a stock like gamestop which was real or electric cars which will become real or elon musk saying you can buy my electric car with bitcoin which made bitcoin more real for people were starting to see more of that institutional adoption so im just curious whether you guys expect that to continue jim if it does maybe all of a sudden this commodity jim bitcoin does start to correlate with more of the world if more of the world is adopting itsurowiecki yeah that last point is a really interesting one i think youve actually seen institutional investors like i could be wrong but  miller has talked about crypto there are bigger money managers who are now starting to think about it jpmorgan chase has talked about the potential value of adding it so i do think that youre seeing actual institutional investors saying this is something we want i assume the big case for beyond the light oh we can make  in a month is the diversification thing but beyond and last thing is fascinating because well i think there are a couple things one is  that it was fascinating to me that you talked about you can use bitcoin to buy a tesla when of course my whole thing is no ones going to do it to use bitcoin to buy tesla because no one wants to use it as currency but it still provides the kind of credibility for bitcoin musk lets face it he just had this weird magic touch its not even clear to me at this point whether its that people think elon musk knows where the future is going or whatever or its that everyone else thinks that elon musk knows where the future is going so if i buy   im sure its some weird mix of the two its illogical if you know everyones going to run you want to get there ahead of time so thats it but yeah he has always been a champion of the concept aaron i dont even know how to pronounce it how do you pronounce it is it dogecoin or is it dogecoinbush i think its dogecoin yeahsurowiecki dogecoin essentially a cryptocurrency invented even more than bitcoin out of almost thin air it felt like a joke when it happened you have lots of people going out there and buying aiding driving the price up mainly because elon musk cracked a joke about it i mean thats nearly a slight exaggeration but im not sure its that much of one its a fascinating investing phenomenon but its also a fascinating cultural phenomenon a fascinating phenomenon about reflexivity and about collective behavior i think the gamestop thing was as well i know ive moved on  but i dont know im interested in hearing aarons thoughts on muskbush yeah i think if you zoom out a bit more bitcoin its legitimacy is all about people believing it into existence over a span of decades it started out a decade ago literally on a discussion board in the corner of the internet where first it had to win over that crowd and help believe some value into existence with that crowd then it slowly emerged since finding likeminded people who believed in the ethos of what this cypherpunk community was trying to accomplish and then slowly that larger group believed more value into what bitcoin was doing of course along the silhouette of what i was talking about earlier we still saw the boom and bust over this long period of time slowly that group becomes larger then you start to see they win over the first institutions and now youre starting to see the first funds or the first money management shops or first even cryptooriented funds emerge that are trying to bring some legitimacy to investing in bitcoin or having it be some part of a portfolio as a wholethen now were at this new phase where were starting to see more and more institutions are starting to believe in this thing now were at the beginning of companies trying to jump on board and i do think in the same way that you have cash and cash equivalent more people might start to put bitcoin as a small part of that equivalent part of their balance sheet were still very early in that happening then after that if this was a video game and bitcoin were trying to level up i think there are still probably bigger bosses to overcome in terms of how do you now win over governments like who are you going to get on your side how do you win over the masses i think its right to think of bitcoin more akin to digital gold but because it is programmable money and there are still are lots of communities and teams who are trying to build things on top of it i do think that there probably is some optionality here to become slightly more than digital gold over time i think thats tbd but just that general trajectory of bitcoin trying to level up and beat these bosses and win over new crowds i think that is what happens and were still right in the middle of it because there is a long way left to gogardner what would be crazy is if bitcoin actually just went sideways for an entire year it became completely dull to look at and everybody it was dead money you know what it would all of a sudden ensconce itself more to our culture and into institutions because of its stability agreebush i agree i guess i would add one more thing i think youve talked about a couple of times before in other episodes david just the idea of antifragility how there are some investments some assets some companies that most probably they suffer from chaos and volatility but others at their core can benefit from volatility and chaos i think that is what has happened with the bitcoin community at large you can see these peaks and troughs really in those trough moments when youre really left with just the builders and just the people who believe that a lot of times is when you see the strength in the community come out where the people who still believe really double down on building what they think is going to make a difference so far its paid off in bigger and bigger ways so i still expect that to happen but i do think bitcoin is more antifragile than perhaps most people expectsurowiecki its interesting because im a completely bitcoin skeptic mainly because i think psychologically im riskaverse and my training mainly with you guys at the fool is really in fundamental investing and the value of a company is their present value of its future free cash flows and all this stuff so the lack of an intrinsic value in the case of bitcoin unnerves me because it does feel at any moment people could just feel like wait why are we spending our money why am i  willing to pay  for this thing but the interesting thing is that obviously you can say the exact same thing about gold and i feel the same way about gold so its no difference gold obviously has some industrial uses etc and it has a longer track record but ultimately the decision of people to be willing to accept gold in exchange for anything or to be willing to spend money to acquire gold and hold it is very akin to the bitcoin thing in principle i dont think theres any obvious reason why the same logic that is applied with gold that is to say it can be a store of value over time cant work in the case of bitcoin i do think that the fact that the supply is limited so you know theres not going to be any more of it that helps it in terms of as a selling point that helps it in terms of being constructed as a store of value so i think its going to be fascinating to see the fact that you said sideways is interesting to me because i am intrigued by what happens if it goes sideways for a year what happens does it just become a thing youre like okay great in a way that would seem to be better in terms of solidifying it but on the other hand maybe aarons right that the volatility is part of what makes it antifragile i dont know yeah its interestingbush i think it will turn sideways at some point i just think theres a ways to go i guess i would be the bull here im happy that i own bitcoin ill probably buy more before i sell any if you compare the market cap of bitcoin to gold i think bitcoin is something around  billion now which is an amazing achievement and gold i think is north of  trillion last i looked it might even be larger than that bitcoin has come a long way but there still is multibagger potential if you think that in an increasingly internetdriven society that store of value that bitcoin just has better characteristics than gold at carrying forward what a store value can be inside a digital world and so i think that still is interestinggardner thank you aaron guys lets widen the focus a little bit more now lets get away from just microstrategy or just bitcoin and lets think about the world ive got a lot of good listener questions coming in on this topic this ones from pablo  pablo writing in from spain says i love your podcast i listen to you every week thank you very much pablo pablo says in this world where institutions states and central banks have so much power is it really possible for bitcoin to unseat fiat currencies and official digital currencies that countries are themselves already developing in some cases thoughtssurowiecki my answer would be no in a way thats the point of the marker piece and i think even of our conversation right now although i think aarons right that there is some optionality built into it it could evolve in other directions actually there are other cryptocurrencies that potentially could become more commonly used just because of the way theyre designed having said that i think the idea that its going to unseat the dollar or replace the yen it was something people tossed around as an idea i dont know to me i say it doesnt seem like a realistic goal it doesnt even feel like its integral to the bitcoin mission anymore it doesnt feel like thats an essential part of what the bitcoin mission is about i mean the idea of having a store of value that is independent of central bank issued currency is but the idea that youre going to replace the dollar i dont know to me it no longer feels like a big part of the discoursebush yeah i intend to agree i dont think bitcoin is going to replace a governments currency anytime soon i wouldnt think that another cryptocurrency would do the same either i think its largely different use cases that said i do think bitcoin is the tip of the spear in some ways for opening up new possibilities maybe shifting the conversation a little bit to ethereum and we dont have to talk too much about this ethereum being the no  cryptocurrency it was built because the founders thought that bitcoin was too inflexible in what it was people were able to build on top of it there has been this whole movement its called  which is decentralized finance where people are attempting to essentially build financial infrastructure on the internet that is separate from the financial infrastructure of big banks that governments are associated with i think this is still very small and still mostly unproven but i think that there are interesting things going on again i dont necessarily think that anything going on here will replace the dollar for example but i do think that this whole digital world thats opening up is going to increasingly complement what is going on with how we think about currency today and how we use it but i think again that were just at the tip of the spear moment so theres still a lot left to be built and proven outsurowiecki the only thing i would say is i think one thing thats important to recognize is how much better the financial system is for consumers today than it was even a decade ago how much easier it is to transfer money at low cost i mean i have no idea if crypto played any role in pushing banks to do that stuff more quickly than they otherwise would have but if you think about  what a pain it was to try to send a money transfer transfer money between accounts or whatever it is its so much easier so much cheaper now in that sense youve actually seen the traditional banks take on some of the characteristics of a  its not exactly decentralized but certainly a digital finance world i think obviously that made it easier to see why the dollar might still be around because its so much easier to do transactions in it than it used to be but we like most consumers take things for granted as soon as we get them but im still amazed that using  like wait i can send money and it gets there and it costs me nothing that wasnt true even  years ago but i think the different use case idea is exactly right for how people are going to use cryptocurrencies going forward but yeah replacing the dollar i just dont see itgardner i was having fun online last night with friends playing a board game over the internet one of my friends pointed me to a new site i shouldve researched this more but were having a spontaneous fun conversation so here i am its something like basketball cards do you remember baseball cards i know you remember baseball cards this one is digital basketball cards and its not just a picture of an athlete like lebron its actually a clip its a video clip of an amazing dunk by lebron these are being created instantaneously and then purchased by people including my friend who then hope to sell them to somebody else at a higher value as a new currency is created now on the one hand it looks a little silly youre like well even basketball cards arent that big a business today after decades so why is this all of a sudden going to be big but at the same time ive seen other things pop up in my lifetime i will say as a magic the gathering card player of some vintage i was buying cards to play with  years ago and now theyre actually worth a fair amount in the real world this is getting to what is worth something in the real world thats the topic thats what i wanted to spend a few minutes oni can play my magic cards or i can sell them to somebody else theyre playing in realworld tournaments with sizable money  internationally so i can see the utility of that i can see the utility of buying shares in a company you are a partowner of that company all of its assets you own a small slice of thats what we do as investors jim surowiecki you and i talked offline beforehand about gamestop and just the phenomenon of gamestop you were tying it in a little bit to bitcoin i want you to speak to that in just a sec but whether were talking about speculative shares like gamestop or i would say more solid shares like my holding in apple these are all stores of value where were all agreeing theyre worth something some things have utility some things dont have any utility at all bitcoin i think the big volatility is based on whether this actually has realworld utility or not that feels like a speculation to me magic cards gold bitcoin shares of stock anything you or i want to put mutual value on and trade with each other i guess can reflectively have valuesurowiecki i mean the basketball card thing is fascinating i actually think the right analogy for the basketball card thing is probably art i think its actually similar to works of art that the value that those cards get in this way theyre different from the magic cards or baseball cards traditionally i could be wrong but i think theres only one card per highlight if you own the highlight you own that highlight now whats weird about it is its not like you have sole rights to reproduce that highlight other people can still go on youtube or the nba can continue to show that highlight or whatever its not like you have exclusive rights which is actually a little different from say a painting or something like that but i think its similar to art you want it because its the only example of it in existence and other people will therefore perhaps value it and its kind of cool i guess i have a friend whos bought one i think looking to trade it whos also somebody whos done a lot of bitcoin trading as well but it is interesting because you can also see even if you think about it in terms of art you can think like there would be certain highlights you might be willing to pay more for like vince carter dunking over whats his name the french guy i dont think the nba has rights to that because that was an olympics games but its the same idea or lebrons block in the finalsbut i do think its like art art clearly is a situation where value is constituted because we collectively decide its worth something that in turn depends in part on whether you think youd be able to resell it  i think that gamestop thing was interesting because in a sense some element of it was built on that idea that they could elevate the stock by an act of collective will the people at the subreddits wallstreetbets they got together they said we can make this thing go up now they were quite strategic it wasnt just a pure act of will because they also said if we do this shorts will have to cover the option sellers will have to buy shares because we bought all these options and that will drive the price up there was actually a quite clever strategic play there but i think the problem for gamestop and basically we saw it happen i think its problem is actually weirdly harder for them to solve than for bitcoin was that when it got to a certain point it wasnt clear what was going to keep it elevated once it got to  the question was what reason is there for me to hold the stock and not cash out because it was very hard to see there was no case there wasnt even a store value case really to think like its going to keep going up or it will hold its value over time because the core problem for gamestop was you had an underlying business and you knew what that underlying business was  relatively speaking  worthi have to think that it acted as a gravity pull ultimately bringing things down to earth i mean if you think about david your model of investing or any fundamental investor on some level the idea is eventually the market will realize to some degree the real value of this company that the fundamental value of the company will eventually be reflected in the stock price thats how you get rich by buying it before the market realizes it and then the market catches up in gamestops case i just think at some point it was like we did this it was a great magic trick okay now what the value was always going to be bringing it down rather than upgardner the fascinating comparison then jim and to extend it back to bitcoin gamestop we can all see the underlying business apart from the speculation in its shares microstrategy in a sense we can look at the underlying business separately but still tied to its balance sheet converted into bitcoin but bitcoin itself it remains very murky what its additional value that we can see beyond itself aaron thoughts on thatbush i think that even if it has failed as a currency it doesnt really matter it doesnt necessarily need to have lots of utility in order to hold lots of value in some ways thats the point i actually do think it will have more utility in time as more people build on top of it even just to backtrack a moment and just hit on i think you were talking about nba top shotgardner thats it thank you aaron yeahsurowiecki thats the name rightbush yeah the card collection digital thing thats going on its also made by dapper labs the same company that made cryptokitties back in the day its a comeback for them theyre actually working on some pretty interesting things but i guess they tie some of this together we havent even really mentioned the word blockchain yet but essentially all that allows you to do is to build scarcity in a digital environment and be able to hold accountability to who owns what in that sense it just enables digital collectibles those collectibles can do different things or they can just be themselves and bitcoin in that sense is the ultimate digital collectible but a lot of those other things that we mentioned like nba top shot or digital art or i would even say i call this the avatar economy what if your card games that youre playing you could actually own the cards and then be able to trade them and sell them as you see fit i think that theres this giant wave that is going on right now where its just what does a digital collectible mean now that we have new technology that can add scarcity to what people are allowed to truly own and not through a company like activision blizzard but truly own themselves how does that change the nature of digital art of video games online of all these different industriesi think right now a lot of that is being built on platforms like ethereum and some people are building their own token systems and such too i dont think bitcoin has a huge role to play in what people are building on top of that for this but i think it could in the future as teams are building new technology on top of bitcoin one of those that i would just call out is called the lightning network thats probably the most notable example of whats being built on top of bitcoin essentially that just allows you to set up a channel between two parties and allow them to transact backandforth really easily it happens quickly and lowcost its really just the beginning and end of that channel that is marked on the actual blockchain itself as a transaction there are really smart people out there who are finding ways to build efficiency and costeffectiveness into what is going on with bitcoin itself if i look at that in pair with a lot of whats going on with i guess the avatar economy and just these digital goods that people want some of it does stuff some of it just is what it is but really over time seeing those two worlds potentially unite is what strikes me as like another  trillion opportunity where bitcoin might help unlock some value either way that value will be unlocked whether its bitcoin or another cryptocurrency but whether bitcoin has a role to play in that is tbd but i think i would bet on it over a long period of timesurowiecki the one thing thats interesting to me is the idea that actually bitcoins relative lack of utility at the moment lets say  lets put it differently the fact that its not obvious what bitcoins intrinsic value is actually in some ways makes it easier to use aarons phrase for it to be believed into existence because it doesnt have that thing pulling it down which gamestops  million a quarter of losses were it doesnt have that so it actually in some ways makes it easier for people to say look this is what we have chosen to invest our money in to go back to the gold analogy gold has certain utilities but that is not why gold became as valuable as it became it did not become as valuable as it did because of its industrial uses it was in a sense a collective act of maybe because its beautiful or whatever it was initially i actually think there is a paradox that the relative lack of utility may be partly whats making it such a good store valuegardner such a provocative point jim thank you for that actually before we go to final statements which were about to go to i would be so remiss if i have the wisdom of crowds author on and i dont ask him if he sees any wisdom in this particular crowd right nowsurowiecki it makes me incredibly nervous to see bitcoin trading this high on the other hand i actually think in some sense it really doesnt fit that well into a lot of the models in the wisdom of crowds or even the madness of crowds i was always interested in  how do groups make good or bad decisions collectively not by necessarily talking to each other but the way they do in the stock market were in like i do feel like bitcoin the core element of it is a little bit closer to a decision to in a sense elevate this thing into being rather than a classic judgment in the same way that you are going to decide about the value of amazon stock or something like that part of the madness of crowds that i think you do see in bitcoin is just the bubbling state sends it up to  whenever weve decided that they need to do it and it drops back down but what can i say i mean ive been wrong about bitcoin maybe thats my statement so ill just leave it at that gardner good well thank you for pushing us into final statements and ill say final statements for now because i know this topic is going to come back and i predict this is not my final statement i predict we will not wait another three years before broaching this one again on rule breaker investing final statements and im going to go first because i have a lame one but it is my final statement so im sticking with it i have never bought bitcoin i have not bought any cryptocurrencies i didnt personally speculate in most of these speculative stocks that people have been running up these kinds of things its just not how i am i think everybody knows that about me if you see something of me in yourself be comfortable with that were doing well were doing well investing in common stocks some of those common stocks even have bitcoin built in them whether its very obvious like microstrategy or maybe a little bit more subtle like perhaps tesla if this boom continues and if its all real i dont even think you have to own it directly and outright because it really is that big and that systemic then it underlies the creation of value across numerous contexts my final statement guys for anybody who might have a fear of missing out or be bewildered by all this i say dont fear it youre fine being bewildered you can do really well in this world without feeling like you need to be right or wrong right now about bitcoin all right thats it from a fool let me turn to another fool aaron bush youre up next final statement sirbush i dont know whats going to happen to bitcoin next but i do think and ill say this because this is the rule breakers podcast i do think bitcoin is the quintessential rule breaker if you look at the six signs of a rule breaker and ill just run through them really quickly feel free to correct me if im saying this gardner you go aaron you gobush no  top dog and first mover in an important emerging industry that is bitcoin it is the top dog and first mover in an important emerging industry no  sustainable advantage gained through business momentum patent protection visionary leadership for an eps competitor obviously its not a business so you have to think a little bit differently about this but bitcoins network effect advantage and brand advantage is really strong and i think gives them a sustainable advantage at least at being that store value no  strong past price appreciation weve seen that for a decade now  no  good management and smart backing again bitcoin doesnt add management instead its founder who is pseudonymous actually has been silent and left the project which for a decentralized system and entity actually is probably the best thing that could have happened for it i would actually give that a check even though its counterintuitive no  strong consumer appeal again i do think we are starting to see some type of consumer appeal with people liking what bitcoin stands for and has become as a brand then no  grossly overvalued according to the financial media  i think that is also a big check every time i hear people write about it or talk about it on cnbc or something and start talking about bitcoins energy or bitcoin is bad as a currency or just all of these things it hits me that theyre just not thinking about it exactly the right way and therefore think its overvalued when maybe it shouldnt be i personally although youve got to make some little tweaks because bitcoin is a cryptocurrency its not a business i would actually put a check mark besides every sign of a rule breaker and i think it is a quintessential rule breakergardner youre opening up some eyes right there aaron bush thank you jim surowiecki my good friend youve got the last words final statement for this cryptopodcastsurowiecki i think my final statement is that you can understand something and be right about it in some ways and still be completely wrong that has really been my experience about bitcoin ive been writing about it for nine years just off and on i think i would go back to  and say yeah that was accurate but it was completely wrong about bitcoin as an investment i think two things one is dont ever listen to me about whats going to happen to bitcoin  in fact you might want to do the opposite of what i suggest but the other thing i would say is just dont chase you just have to be willing to accept where you are youre going to make mistakes as an investor and what you dont want to do is end up chasing just because it feels like everyone else is doing thatgardner thats where we left it again thank you to jim surowiecki and to aaron bush i really loved both of their final statements my hope for this podcast i think was fulfilled it was to get you and me selfishly me too to get us to think smarter about the world in this case the world of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies the world that were living into as we watch the volatility of a very disruptive potential rule breaker in the form of bitcoin the past at this point is but prologue even this present is prologue lets see what happens going forward speaking of going forward next week is your rule breaker investing mailbag yep its the final wednesday in this case february  if you find yourself interested provoked or inspired by anything that youve heard not just in this weeks podcast but by my blast from the past volume  last week or the touch off to this month horse of a different color that would be the joy i had having my friend reiner knizia the famous german board game designer joining us in the first week of this month well id love to hear from you the email address is rbifoolcom we read every note sent to us because many notes are sent to us we cant share them all but i always try to give you the best in the meantime i hope you have a great week fool on
