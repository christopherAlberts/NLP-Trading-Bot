sending crypto from wallet to wallet and closing business deals in between panels and speeches the novelty of taking part in a largely indoor event free of covid restrictions contributed to the

social network built on the blockchain technology that underpins most cryptocurrencies the afterparties took over rooftops across the city with at least one featuring fire dancers the oasis one of the biggest nightclubs in miami was nonstop crypto there isnt a way to quantify the level that an event like this boosts business said mati greenspan portfolio manager and founder of quantum economics who

masse – or at least opening additional offices mayor francis suarez has portrayed himself as bitcoinfriendly – suarez announced in february that miami plans to accept tax payments in bitcoin and let employees draw their salary in the cryptocurrency though the timing of the rollout is unclear the city is also exploring holding bitcoin on its balance sheet now the entire city seems to be getting on board from waiters to uber drivers a bouncer at the nightclub and even a lady selling tchotchkes at the mall most locals i met on the ground seemed to be somewhat familiar with cryptocurrencies and many of them are hodling said greenspan of the few days he spent in miami carter himself is considering the move virtually everyone ive talked to is super bullish on texas and florida and pretty bearish on on new york san francisco and boston he said i left this thinking that im going to make that transition myselfbitcoin fixes everythinga common refrain from some of the biggest names on stage was that bitcoin fixes everything which pretty much sums up the general sentiment at the conference we say bitcoin is hope bitcoin fixes everything said saylor that certainly was the case with our stock dorsey also doubled down on his commitment to the cryptocurrency if i were not at square or twitter id be working on bitcoin if it needed more help than square and twitter i would leave them for bitcoin said dorseythe undertone of widespread support for bitcoin carried with it a spirit of rebellion against the existing financial system we dont need the banks anymore continued dorsey we dont need the financial institutions that we have today cameron winklevoss wore a tshirt with a picture of the federal reserve building with a caption reading rage against the machine a reference to how bitcoin is not controlled by a central bank as one panel mc put it we are going to put the fed out of business which speaks to how people at bitcoin  generally regarded the monetary system and fiat money with bitcoin seen as the solutiontyler winklevoss and cameron winklevoss lr creators of crypto exchange gemini trust co on stage at the bitcoin  convention a cryptocurrency conference held at the mana convention center in wynwood on june   in miami florida joe raedle  getty imagesbut a repudiation of the status quo doesnt mean anarchy in many of my conversations with attendees the narrative was far from an advocation of societal collapse or dissolution the whole point of bitcoin is that its apeaceful protest against a monetary system that people want no part of said carter i dont think the fed has a lot to fear from bitcoin you dont have to take to the streets to promote bitcoin the conference drew participants from countries with high inflation or other currency troubles – places like venezuela cuba turkey nigeria lebanon and iran – who perhaps best understand the use case for a cryptocurrency like bitcoin there are hundreds of people in these places and you dont have to explain bitcoin to them they understand it intuitively explained carter that was one of the best parts of the conference for me meeting people who felt the realworld impact of currency collapse and seeing how they use bitcoin one consistent theme of the conference was the maturity of the lightning network a payments platform built on bitcoin which enables instant transactions virtually every booth at the conference was accepting lightning transactions even square and twitter ceo jack dorsey completed one during his main stage talk with alex gladstein of the human rights foundation thats a real success story said carter its taken four or five years for lightning to be built on top of bitcoin but its working nowthe shadow of elon
