its been nearly four months since i took a look at two of the more popular ways for investors to get some skin in the bitcoin cryptobtc game through traditional stock brokerages im not talking about bitcoin miners crypto exchanges and the many other companies that stand to benefit from wider adoption of digital currencies as either investments or transaction settlersgrayscale bitcoin trust otcgbtc and osprey bitcoin trust otcobtc are two us exchangetraded trusts that only own bitcoin grayscale bitcoin trust is much larger entering this new week with  billion in assets under management ospreys entry hit the market in midfebruary and it currently manages nearly  million in assets lets kick the tires to see which one  if any  is worth buying right nowtoken of your affectioncomparing a pair of exchangetraded funds often leads one to pit one investment over the other in terms of management and performance but these are passive investments concentrated in a single cryptocurrency the bigger sticking points in this debate should be fees and discounts to net asset value or navwhen it comes to fees osprey bitcoin trust is the clear winner it charges an annual fee of   less than a fourth of grayscales  bite these fees are taken out over the course of the year from the assets so the actual bitcoin per share owned by grayscale bitcoin trust investors is shrinking four times as fast as osprey bitcoin trustif both funds were trading at nav this would seem to be a fairly easy decision there are economies of scale that may benefit the larger grayscale in terms of management grayscale is a pioneer in crypto but its not as if osprey is green in this space it is backed by experts who have invested in bitcoin since  launching more than  exchangetraded products to datehowever the reason crypto exposureseeking investors will want to choose grayscale bitcoin trust today is that it offers far more bang for your buck than the alternative grayscale bitcoin trust once traded at a lofty premium to its stash of crypto but it has been largely trading at a discount since february shares of the trust may have closed out last week at  but that was a  discount to the  in bitcoin represented by every shareosprey bitcoin trust hit the market in february when cryptocurrency mania was raging near the end of that month  when i was initially pitting one against the other  it was trading at a  premium in other words investors were paying nearly  a share for a trust that owned a little more than  in cryptothe math is kinder these days as investor enthusiasm has waned for bitcoin weve seen the premium for ospreys trust decline sharply it closed at  on friday just a  premium to its  in navchoosing grayscale over osprey back in late february was the right call bitcoin would go on to climb for a few weeks before correcting sharply since april but the discount in the former helped it weather the selloff better than the latter with a ridiculous premium grayscales  decline in that time isnt pleasant but its a far better fate than the  plunge for osprey bitcoin trust investorsim no longer bearish on osprey bitcoin trust exposure to the worlds most valuable denomination for cryptocurrency in a vehicle with just  in annual fees is better than the  commission that many of the leading platforms to buy tokens directly will charge you for the purchase if the premium continues to narrow i may even turn bullish its a nobrainer if it reaches a discount however right now grayscale bitcoin trust at a  discount is the better buy a difference of  basis points in annual fees is huge but thats no match for a roughly  gap in basis points between the discounts and premiums of the two vehicles if youre looking to invest in cryptocurrency  and want to go through your traditional stock broker  grayscale bitcoin trust is a smart way to do it at its current discount
