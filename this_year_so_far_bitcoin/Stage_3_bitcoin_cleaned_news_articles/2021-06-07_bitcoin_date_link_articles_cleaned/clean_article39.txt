there has been recent speculation that banks are about to enter the cryptocurrency markets this makes a lot of commercial sense there clearly is customer demand for banks to offer services similar to those they offer for other financial assetsbut cryptocurrencies including perhaps the most famous example – bitcoin – are not like other financial assets they are highly volatile and raise significant questions of proper risk management custody and use while banks generally have broad powers to engage in custody trust and financial intermediation activities on behalf of their customers their ability to engage in investment and trading activities for their own account is much more limited as a result when considering the degree to which banks may engage with cryptocurrencies one fundamental question is whether banks may own or trade bitcoin on a principal basis david m solomon chief executive officer of goldman sachs does not think so given his comments from the recent goldman sachs earnings callof course we need to operate within the current regulatory guidelines for example we cannot own bitcoin or trade it as we think we know why solomon said this cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are commodities and banks have limited authority to own or trade certain commodities as  in federal banking law parlance these activities may be physical commodities the trading of which requires special  why does this matter certain authorities permit banks to commence new activities immediately while others require the prior approval of the board of governors of the federal reserve the federal reserve and can take a significant amount of time and expensebelow we analyze these restrictions and how they may affect the ability of banks to own and trade bitcoinbitcoin is a commoditybitcoin is a virtual currency created in  many of its salient characteristics – among others a reliance on publickey cryptography a distributed ledger maintained by a decentralized peertopeer network of computers and a consensus mechanism allowing that decentralized network to agree on the contents of the ledger – form the foundation of many digital assets that exist today another key characteristic of bitcoin is that it is intangible it exists only as strings of data and as a result it and other digital assets raise the existential question of how one should classify them for regulatory purposes in  the commodity futures trading commission the cftc determined that certain virtual currencies including bitcoin are commodities subject to regulation and enforcement under the commodity exchange act the while bitcoin has been around for more than a decade its emergence as an asset with a market sizable enough to attract the attention of institutional investors and global banks is fairly recent we previously began investigating the ability of banks to engage with virtual currencies in a number of contexts that implicated the volcker  but many issues remain to be analyzed below we consider whether bank holding companies bhcs may engage in the spot trading of virtual currencies under the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhc what commodities activities may bhcs engage insection  of the bhc act and the regulation y laundry listsection  of the bhc act prohibits bhcs from engaging directly or indirectly in any nonbanking activities unless an exemption from the general prohibition is  commodities activities are generally characterized as nonbanking activities and are therefore subject to this general prohibition absent an exemption these exemptions generally referred to as authorities are available for a wide range of investments and activities one such authority section  of the bhc act permits bhcs to engage in nonbanking activities that are closely related to banking as that term has been defined by the federal  pursuant to the federal reserves regulation  bhcs may engage in investing and trading activities as principal with respect to the followingb forward contracts options futures options on futures swaps and similar contracts whether traded on exchanges or not based on any rate price financial asset including gold silver platinum palladium copper or any other metal approved by the  nonfinancial asset or group of assets other than a bankineligible  ifa state member bank is authorized to invest in the asset underlying the contract the contract requires cash settlement the contract allows for assignment termination or offset prior to delivery or expiration and the company— makes every reasonable effort to avoid taking or making delivery of the asset underlying the contract or receives and instantaneously transfers title to the underlying asset by operation of contract and without taking or making physical delivery of the asset or the contract does not allow for assignment termination or offset prior to delivery or expiration and is based on an asset for which futures contracts or options on futures contracts have been approved for trading on a us contract market by the commodity futures trading commission and the company— makes every reasonable effort to avoid taking or making delivery of the asset underlying the contract or receives and instantaneously transfers title to the underlying asset by operation of contract and without taking or making physical delivery of the assetc forward contracts  futures options on futures swaps and similar contracts whether traded on exchanges or not based on an index of a rate a price or the value of any financial asset nonfinancial asset or group of assets if the contract requires cash settlementcommodities derivatives activities that bhcs conduct pursuant to the foregoing provisions of regulation y are subject to a number of restrictions designed to curtail the risks associated with commercial commodities activities specifically with respect to derivatives on commodities that banks cannot own directly which are most commodities other than certain precious metals bhcs are required to make every reasonable effort to avoid physical delivery of the underlying commodities or to take physical delivery only on an instantaneous passthrough basis if a bhc already is engaging in these activities with respect to other commodities it should be able to begin such services with bitcoin without further approval from the federal reserve a bhc beginning such commodities activities de novo generally can gain approval to do so from the federal reserve within  days of providing a shortform notice to the federal according to regulation y it seems likely that bhcs may invest in and trade bitcoin but only as long as they do not take the bitcoin on their balance sheets as principal while this provision will allow bhcs to engage with their clients in many clientdriven trades and financings it does not permit the bhcs to take bitcoin as principal on their balance sheets in almost any key to this conclusion is a determination that a bhc engaging as principal with bitcoin does not take physical delivery of the bitcoin as bitcoin is a digital asset that does not appear in physical form the application of this standard is unclear however as the term physical in this context refers to accepting delivery of a commodity as opposed to the nature of the commodity we believe that any transaction that results in a bhc taking title to or control over bitcoin will meet the definition of physical commodities the glb act and section  of the bhc actin  the glb act added section  to the bhc act the glb act authorized an additional set of powers for certain bhcs bhcs that are among other things wellcapitalized and wellmanaged may elect to be treated as financial holding companies fhcs among other provisions in the glb act section  permits the federal reserve to determine upon an application that an fhc may engage in activities that are complementary to a financial  the glb act did not define what constitutes a complementary activity nor did the legislative history provide guidancehowever the federal reserve has since issued a number of orders to individual fhcs allowing those fhcs to engage in trading activities with respect to certain physical commodities including both spot transactions and derivatives transactions that require the fhc to take physical possession of the commodities in question the federal reserve determined that section  complementary authority was intended to allow the  to permit fhcs to engage in a limited basis in an activity that appears to be commercial rather than financial in nature but that is meaningfully connected to a financial activity such that it complements the financial  given these precedents we believe that the federal reserve could permit an fhc upon approval by the federal reserve to use its complementary authority to engage in spot transactions as principal with respect to bitcoin subject to other separate restrictions in the glb act and other applicable what is the history of the federal reserve permitting physical commodities trading for bhcsthe federal reserve first addressed physical commodities activities by bhcs in approving citigroups application to retain phibro as part of the acquisition of citicorp by  the federal reserve stated that trading activities at phibro flow from the existing financial activities of fhcs in that they would provide fhcs with an alternative method of fulfilling their contractual obligations under other activities that they may engage in pursuant to regulation y for example if warranted by market conditions an fhc would be able to use physical settlement rather than terminating assigning offsetting or otherwise cashsettling a contract as the inability to settle transactions physically would otherwise place fhcs at a competitive disadvantage the federal reserve concluded that permitting the physical commodities trading activities did not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generallythe physical commodities trading activities were not being carried out by citigroups depository institutions and citigroup committed that i the market value of commodities held as a result of the activities would at no time exceed five percent of citigroups consolidated tier  capital and ii citigroup would notify its supervising federal reserve bank if the market value of commodities held by citigroup as a result of its physical commodities trading activities exceeded four percent of its tier  capital citigroup could make and take delivery only of physical commodities for which derivatives had been approved for trading on a us futures exchange by the cftc unless the federal reserve permitted otherwise this requirement was designed to prevent citigroup from dealing in items that lacked the fungibility and liquidity of exchange traded instrumentsthe federal reserve also imposed conditions on the conduct of the activities to minimize storage risk transportation risk and legal and environmental risks citigroup would not be permitted to own operate or invest in facilities for the extraction transportation storage or distribution of commodities or to process refine or otherwise alter commodities citigroup committed to using storage and transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties and to take additional measures with respect to environmentally sensitive products such as oil and gas finally the activities would remain subject to general securities commodities and energy rules and regulationsthe federal reserve ordersfollowing the citigroup approval a string of other domestic and foreign fhcs received approval to engage in physical commodities trading activities from  to  subsequent federal reserve orders permitting the activities for particular fhcs imposed conditions highly similar to those imposed on citigroup collectively the the orders interpretation of the term complementary in section  of the bhc act is also consistent with the citigroup order the orders used similar language defining complementary as allow the  to permit fhcs to engage in a limited basis in an activity that appears to be commercial rather than financial in nature but that is meaningfully connected to a financial activity such that it complements the financial activitythe principal nonfinancial risks related to physical commodities trading activities have not changed since  they are the risks associated with commodities that may trade on markets that lack sufficient liquidity and price transparency with respect to commodities such as oil and gas there are also considerations with respect to storage transportation environmental and other similar risks the conditions that the federal reserve imposed upon physical commodities activities in its previous orders directly targeted those risks and there has been no evidence that permitting such activities has translated into a substantial risk to the financial system generallyfinally in approving the physical commodities trading activities in the orders the federal reserve found that the conduct of such activities by fhcs could reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweighed any potential adverse effects as of  any order that has not been explicitly retracted by the federal reserve remains in placeunlike commodities activities that a bhc engages in pursuant to section  of the bhc act an application to engage in physical commodities trading must be made pursuant to section  of the bhc  while regulation y generally provides defined time periods within which the federal reserve will act upon an application requests for approval of a complementary activity can take a significant amount of time given that the federal reserve has not approved an application to engage in complementary activities since  it seems likely that a request for complementary authority to engage in physical commodities trading with respect to a previously unapproved product such as bitcoin would likely face a lengthy approval processconclusionthe swift rise in price and continued development of an ecosystem surrounding bitcoin has created demand by many bank clients for banks to offer financial services related to bitcoin there are numerous prudential hurdles related to offering such services including the creation of systems to safely custody and manage the risks associated with dealing with a volatile asset as a result banks should carefully consider all of the regulatory implications associated with engaging in activities related to bitcoin to the extent an fhc would like to purchase trade or hold bitcoin as principal the classification of bitcoin as a commodity means that the fhc would likely be required to obtain approval from the federal reserve to engage in physical commodities activities on the basis that they are complementary to a financial activityappendix goldman sachs group inc gs   earnings call transcript  the motley fool notwithstanding solomon’s assertion it is interesting to note that goldman sachs is one of the two financial holding companies that benefit from the grandfather authority provided under section  of bank holding company act of  as amended this authority added by the grammleachbliley act of  glb act allows companies that were engaged in commodities activities but were not bank holding companies as of november   to continue to engage in activities related to the trading sale or investment in commodities and underlying physical properties if they should later become financial holding companies goldman sachs and morgan stanley both meet this criteria and as a result they enjoy a much broader range of commodities powers than other financial holding companies see report to the congress and the financial stability oversight council pursuant to section  of the doddfrank act federalreservegov therefore goldman sachs is arguably not prohibited from owning or trading bitcoin under the commodities restrictions discussed herein there may also be statebased restrictions a cftc primer on virtual
