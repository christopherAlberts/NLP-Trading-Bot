bitfinex one of the largest centralized crypto exchanges is now a shareholder in a decentralized exchange dex that doesn’t conduct knowyourcustomer kyc checksthe british virgin islandsbased exchange has purchased a stake in hodl hodl a dex that provides lending and private transaction services“when it comes to genuine support of the bitcoin ecosystem bitfinex is about action rather than just words” said paolo ardoino cto at bitfinex in a statement shared with coindesk “our investment in hodl hodl will help grow its amazing community and support the wider digital token ecosystem”subscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policya move might seem a bit unorthodox for bitfinex the sixthlargest spot exchange in the world and a sister firm of the major stablecoin issuer tether centralized exchanges have been closely watching the fledgling decentralized finance defi industry since last year’s boom and some like binance and ftx are dipping their toes in the sector by launching binance dex and serumbitfinex in fact was one of the first to launch its own dex ethfinex back in  the exchange later spun off of bitfinex and was rebranded as diversifihowever major exchanges haven’t invested in outside defi vehicles so far and in addition to being the first bitfinex also made a somewhat unexpected choice of partner unlike most dexs hodl hodl runs on the bitcoin blockchain the firm has also recently launched a peertopeer lending platform lend allowing users to borrow stablecoins including tether directly from other users for bitcoin collateraland here is where bitfinex comes into play“bitfinex will provide us more liquidity for lending” hodl hodl ceo max keidun told coindesk pointing out that tether which shares executives and corporate ownership with bitfinex is the issuer of usdt the most popular stablecoin to date“the demand for lending is growing and sometimes we don’t have enough liquidity on the platform” keidun added “so we need an institutional provider and soon some more institutions will join  as well”he said that since the lending platform launched over seven months ago more than  loans have been issued worth over  million in totalcexdex integrationin addition to the extra liquidity the hodl hodl and bitfinex alliance will bring some more bonuses keidun said both exchanges are users of liquid a permissioned settlement layer for exchanges run by blockstream the two exchanges have been thinking of releasing some new features on liquid together keidun saidanother opportunity is a potential integration of hodl hodl with bitfinex’s api which would help hodl hodl users to automatically convert bitcoin into stablecoins through bitfinex keidun saidon lend lenders and borrowers open two out of three multisignature wallets in which borrowers lock their bitcoin collateral to receive stablecoins from lenders stablecoin transactions happen outside of the platformwhen the loan expires or if the price fluctuates too much and the collateral doesn’t sufficiently cover the loan anymore the bitcoin collateral gets liquidated part of it equal to the amount of borrowed stablecoins goes to the lender and the rest goes back to the borrower as the loans are normally overcollateralizedso if a lender doesn’t want bitcoin instead of the stablecoin they provided earlier they can immediately exit back into stablecoins via bitfinex with a proper integration keidun saidat the moment the hodl hodl team around  people holds around  of the company keidun said and the rest is in the hands of a handful of investors including lemniscap venture fund and bitcoin advocate stefan jespersthese numbers will not change after bitfinex enters the scene it has bought an undisclosed amount of shares from another investor on the secondary market keidun said bitfinex will be a significant shareholder but it won’t make hodl hodl dependent on its partner he adds“every decision at hodl hodl is made by the team we’re fully autonomous and independent from our shareholders” keidun said adding “of course we consult with our investors and don’t make important strategic shifts without talking to them but in general we’re independent and autonomous”regulatory concernsanother interesting point in this new alliance are potential regulatory ramifications as hodl hodl is by design a kycfree crypto business bitfinex only recently recovered from a court battle with the new york attorney general which alleged bitfinex covered a  million hole in its budget with the funds from tether’s reserves the case ended with a settlement and now tether is obliged to provide the breakdown of its reserves on a monthly basishodl hodl is one of the very few places allowing bitcoin purchases for fiat with no know your customerantimoney laundering checks as hodl hodl’s team says the exchange’s noncustodial approach allows it to be “exempt” from the kycaml requirements for crypto which has been increasingly spreading across the world under the auspices of the financial action task force fatfbut hodl hodl which runs on multisignature bitcoin contracts doesn’t custody users’ fiat or crypto ceo keidun said which makes it “exempt” from the kyc requirements all the deals are executed automatically directly between users’ personal bitcoin and fiat accounts except for the disputes when the hodl hodl team weighs in with its own private key for a multisig and releases funds to whatever party is considered rightthis makes hodl hodl closer to the defi enterprises like uniswap than to centralized exchanges like bitfinex however such dexs running on ethereum or other blockchain smart contracts normally don’t allow you to buy crypto for fiat – for that you need to go to a centralized exchange which accepts your fiat and requests a kyc verificationthis combination of a fiat onramp and noncustodial approach makes hodl hodl a somewhat exotic creature on the current crypto landscape and a rare exception from the prevalent attitude towards more compliance and regulationasked if this worries investors at all keidun said that talks about kyc happen “quite rarely” from time to time however some investors would ask “what if new regulations get introduced”“if kyc requirements get introduced for noncustodial services we have plans for how we structure our business for different scenarios playing out” keidun saidasked if hodl hodl’s nokyc policy is of any concern for bitfinex the company’s senior pr manager joe morgan declined to comment on the matter saying that “this is really a question for hodl hodl as bitfinex is merely collaborating with them”
