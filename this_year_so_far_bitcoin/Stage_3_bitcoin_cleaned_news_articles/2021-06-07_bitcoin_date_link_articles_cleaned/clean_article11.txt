crypto investing pioneer and former hedge fund manager mike novogratz has stacked up billions of dollars by making bold bets on digital assetshe’s built up his crypto ecosystem company galaxy digital brphf into something akin to a crypto berkshire hathaway if there were such an equivalent in crypto through investments in promising blockchain projects and his recent record setting  billion acquisition of custody giant bitgoand similar to the way equity investors turn to berkshire’s warren buffett novogratz has established himself as one voice crypto investors often look to for the next great call “well i am the oldest guy in crypto” he joked in an exclusive interview with yahoo finance at the sold out bitcoin  conference in miami over the weekendin explaining the  selloff that hit bitcoin in may to officially rank as the worst month for bitcoin in a decade novogratz first dialed in on what he says drove the big run up to kick off the year institutional buyersgalaxy digital founder and ceo mike novogratz  joined yahoo finances zack guzman for an exclusive conversation about bitcoin at bitcoin  in miami“institutional money is wildly important let me give you some numbers — total crypto market cap thats bitcoin and everything else is about a trillion and a half dollars” he said “thats  basis points of total global wealth —  basis points — nothing for that to shift to   which im fundamentally of the belief that it will you need institutions they own all the money”as novogratz contends a lot of institutional players and hedge funds piled in around the  level back when hedge fund manager paul tudor jones first laid out his investing thesis and advocated bitcoin’s digital gold use case in may “a year later it’s at  and the urge to ring the cash register is such a deepseated human urge that that’s what happened” he said “and so we see these kind of step function moves and then well see a long period of consolidation  and youre waiting for the new narrative to arrive that brings the next wave of money and i think were in one of those periods right now”story continuesone catalyst that novogratz lists as a potential narrative shift is the securities and exchange commission sec finally approving a bitcoin etf there are currently more than  applications pending approval one of which is from galaxy digital itself novogratz previously told yahoo finance he was thrilled that gary gensler was appointed sec chairman and predicted he would approve a bitcoin etf by the end of the year“the big wealth in america is  to  they typically work through rias registered investment advisors theyre slower to buy in — that trend has started — the etf just makes it easier” he said “and so yes if we had an etf tomorrow the price would go higher”elsewhere the explosion of options to earn yield on crypto assets like bitcoin either through centralized digital asset platforms like blockfi which galaxy is invested in or decentralized finance applications is also drawing in capital that’s caught unused in a low interest rate environment blockfi advertises  apy on bitcoin while other decentralized applications like thorchain offer yield over  as entities that loan out assets they take in they could become sec targets novogratz predicted but he also shared a belief that genslers understanding of crypto would lead him to act appropriatelyi dont think all regulation is terrible i think we need good regulation gary gensler is a smart guy i trust that hes going to come out with smart regulation novogratz said adding that it could help attract more capital into the defi decentralized finance space i actually think one of the big surprises of the next five years is just how fast defi takes offof course that could bode less well for traditional banks and lending institutions as jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon lamented in his shareholder letter earlier this year nonbank competitors have been able to operate more nimbly without added regulatory hoops to jump through if more of that is allowed to continue defis explosion is unlikely to subside total value locked in all defi protocols like thorchain have risen nearly  from  billion in december to almost  billion at the peak in may according to numbers from defillama“ are going to lobby like crazy — less against bitcoin more against defi — but bitcoin is the trojan horse to get everything in  and so revolutions don’t happen without a little bloodshed novogratz said someone is losing when someone is winning”zack guzman is an anchor for yahoo finance live as well as a senior writer covering
