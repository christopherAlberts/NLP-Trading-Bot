 bitcoin block rewards from  moved today mystery miner spent  million in btc since black thursdayon saturday february   newsbitcoincom reported on the great number of  and  block rewards being spent this year in that report it was said that the mysterious whale entity we’ve been hunting “did not move a major string of bitcoin’s” since january  following the publishing of that study on sunday the oldschool whale miner moved another  block rewards from  as  bitcoins that sat idle for well over a decade were spent decadeold bitcoins spent since march  since midmarch newsbitcoincom has been on the trail for an oldschool bitcoin btc miner that has been spending large strings of  block rewards a block reward is an incentive a bitcoin miner gets for finding a block on the bitcoin blockchain and before  all rewards were  btc per block further the technical term “spend” or “spent” simply means the owner moved the coins but it doesn’t necessarily mean the bitcoins were “sold” to another ownerour report on saturday had shown that there were  block rewards from  that were spent this year interestingly  block rewards from the  days also got spent in  as well on sunday february   following our last report the whale miner once again spent another  block rewards from  at block height  it’s assumed the mystery miner is seeking attentionour last study also mentioned the megawhale or group of whales that have been spending these  blocks in strings of  blocks per transfer since midmarch our team alongside researchers from btcparsercom and the russian blockchain researcher issak shvarts have discovered a total of  spending strings from all of the strings use the same exact pattern of spending in concessions of  consecutive decadeold blocks  block reward string spends from  happened on march   october  november  november  december  january   bitcoin’s anniversary january  january  and today sunday february   as wellthat’s a total of  block rewards and each and every one of them contained  btc per block the persons always consolidates the bitcoins into a single btc address and then the coins are dispersed thereafter in fractions usually all the strings of spent blocks stem from july  up until november  and the coinbase dates are always the same monthsthe block explorer oxtme also shows the  whale’s pattern of spending habits are always the same one researcher discussing the subject with our newsdesk yesterday said “maybe they have some special application a script which is not really flexible and may get only  private keys at a time but a list of receiving addresses”either spending solutions are not flexible or the whale is flexing and wants attentionblockchair’s privacyometer shows the mystery miner’s first spends are always susceptible to heuristics and transaction tracing tools the  string spends always have a “rare fingerprint” “cospending” “same address in inputs” and “sweep” techniquesafter the first consolidation the transactions ‘go dark’ from here and privacy is increased from  to  points according to blockchair stats issak shvarts believes that numerous  strings that have followed this exact same spending pattern have likely been sold to the san franciscobased exchange coinbasemoreover except for the one specific midmarch  decadeold string spend the mysterious miner or miners always spend the corresponding bitcoin cash bch as well furthermore the mining entity never moves the corresponding bitcoinsv bsv except for the one time on march whatever the case may be the oldschool whale or whales spending the strings of  block rewards seem to want attention unless the whale is forced to use a nonflexible spending script or weird spending habit our deduction so far is that the whale is a showoff and definitely wants the public’s attentionit is quite a coincidence that after our newsdesk writes “so far this particular entity or entities have not moved a major string of bitcoins since then” yesterday and then the whale spends another string of  block rewards from   btc we also know on october  the entity or entities did send  btc  worth at the time to the free software foundation and another  btc to the american institute for economic research aierthe whale has spent roughly  decadeold block rewards todate adding up to approximately  btc that’s over  million worth of bitcoin using exchange rates on sunday
