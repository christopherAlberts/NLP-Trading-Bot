after a dramatic week in which the crypto industry’s eyes were on coinbase’s nasdaq debut it’s time to step back and reflect plenty of pixels and airtime have already been beamed plenty of analysis has been performed about the valuation and growth outlook but not enough has been said about what i think is the long gamesome have wondered if brian armstrong coinbase’s ceo and cofounder is “selling out” by going public a business that was built around an asset group created to eliminate the need for centralized gatekeepers ends up joining the centralized system how could heyou’re reading crypto long  short a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets authored by coindesk’s head of research noelle acheson it goes out every sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view you can subscribe herei don’t think coinbase going public is contradictory at all look deeper and you see a strategic move to influence the system from withinnew rulesby joining the ranks of listed companies coinbase is now part of the traditional financial establishment only it’s not reallyit still is a business premised on assets that do not function like traditional assets and that permit a level and speed of innovation unlike any before in the financial industry it is still through and through a crypto businessthis is more farreaching than it sounds it’s not just about providing a platform for the buying and selling of crypto tokens that’s significant and currently accounts for  of coinbase’s net revenue but it’s “just” the onramp it provides a relatively easy way for new investors to take their first steps into crypto – but it won’t change traditional marketscoinbase’s commitment to capital markets reform can be seen in a couple of recent announcements earlier this month coinbase joined forces with fidelity square and others to form the crypto council for innovation which will lobby policy makers to support the growing crypto asset industry a couple of days later coinbase announced that it was joining the defi alliance an organization that supports decentralized finance defi startups with guidance around regulations and market operationsinstitutions are increasingly recognizing that defi could impact established processes but they generally regard it as being too “out there” to be a meaningful threat imagine a large cap company actively promoting defi services showing off their advantages and convincing other large cap companies that the operational benefit is worth the risk and the costnew incentivessince money speaks louder than words let’s look at some of coinbase’s recent investmentsin january coinbase acquired bison trails a startup focused on staking services to expand into the infrastructureasaservice segment this isn’t just any type of infrastructure though staking is based on a new type of consensus protocol in which the stakeholders of a network those that hold the assets vote on transaction validation and other governance issues in exchange for locking up their ether holdings stakers earn a yield in the case of the beacon chain ethereum’s beta transition towards a full proofofstake blockchain this yield can be as much as  annuallythe bison trails acquisition is said to be one of coinbase’s largest to date which suggests that they will be looking to leverage this beyond simply offering clients access to yield opportunities staking exists as an incentive to actively participate in a network’s governance the key word here is “incentive” we saw this week how the median ceo pay in the us jumped  to  million at a time when gdp slumped and unemployment soared the main reason is that top executive compensation is increasingly linked to stock market performance which can skew strategic decisions by moving focus to shortterm results and superficial investorappeasing press releasesimagine the impact of a toptier listed company showing stakeholders in other industries alternative incentive mechanisms with more balanced rewards and greater involvement in the communitynew types of assetanother area to keep an eye on is coinbase’s actual and potential investments in tokenized securities in the  filing the company said my emphasis“shortly following the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part our board of directors will be authorized subject to limitations prescribed by delaware law to issue common stock in one or more series … in the form of blockchainbased tokens” this is a powerful and somewhat overlooked statement the board of directors can do this “without further vote or action” by the company’s stockholders and bear in mind the company has stakes in several security token platforms and issuers through its venture capital arm coinbase venturescoinbase is not registered as a brokerdealer or alternative trading system ats so it cannot legally trade securities of any type on its main platform its subsidiary coinbase capital markets is an secregistered brokerdealer however and coinbase securities is an secregistered ats so blockchainbased securities trading could well be on the horizonjust think of the market buzz if one of nasdaq’s largestcap companies issued security tokens that could trade on its own platform nasdaq would effectively be hosting the emergence of a parallel securities market that could end up being significant competition talk about changing capital markets from withinnew beginningsand this is the main point coinbase did not “sell out” it took the “revolution” to the castle on the way it got its early investors an exit gave its shareholders liquidity and set the stage for easier and cheaper capital raises going forwardthe main takeaway though is that crypto market businesses are now in the big leagues they now have a seat at the traditional capital markets table this is where the real impact on today’s systems startschain linksthe senate approved by a  vote the nomination of gary gensler as the new chair of the us securities and exchange commission sec takeaway it’s now official and this is good news as chairman gensler understands the crypto industry he has taught courses on it at mit and i have personally heard him speak thoughtfully and knowledgeably about some of its more complicated aspects there will no doubt be many of these piling up in his intray by the time he first sits at his new deskchicagobased rothschild investment corporation recently bought  shares of the grayscale ethereum trust ethe and added just under  shares to its previous grayscale bitcoin trust gbtc holding of  shares at current prices its gbtc holding is worth almost  million while its ethe holding is at  million takeaway it’s not often we come across institutional asset managers that are more heavily invested in ether than in bitcoin but i wouldn’t be surprised to see more of this going forward for an overview of the different investment cases for bitcoin and ether download our recent report “bitcoin  ether an investor’s perspective”purpose investments and ci global asset management both received approval to launch an ether etf on the toronto stock exchange tsx takeaway in early march evolve also filed for an eth etf so we could soon see a third if this happens soon this would make three btc and three eth etfs in north america – just not in the us the world’s largest etf market galaxy digital has filed with the sec for a bitcoin etf takeaway for those keeping score this makes seven bitcoin etf applications in front of the sec with only two currently under active review vaneck and wisdomtreedigital asset manager grayscale investments a subsidiary of dcg also parent of coindesk has taken an equity stake in etf issuer clearshares takeaway details are scarce for instance it’s not clear if grayscale has a minority or a majority stake but this seems to confirm grayscale’s commitment to issuing other types of products last week it issued a statement expressing its intention to convert its flagship fund to an etf when that becomes legally possibleswissbased metaco whose clients include several large banks is building an offering of decentralized finance and staking services for its institutional clients takeaway this is one of several signs we have started seeing recently of growing traditional finance in defi beyond the potential profit in holding the relevant tokens decentralized finance may seem like the antithesis of the centralized financial services banks offer but it appears that some appreciate the potential market expansion and cost reduction enabled by some of these new platforms furthermore we are likely to see a growing interest from banks in staking the equivalent of mining on proofofstake blockchains as it offers a yield unavailable in mainstream markets
