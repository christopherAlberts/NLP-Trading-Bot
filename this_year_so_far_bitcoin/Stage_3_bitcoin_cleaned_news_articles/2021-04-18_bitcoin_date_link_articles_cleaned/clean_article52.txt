the  playing at the love shack in the video for their eponymous  hitlovesac versus love shackin their  hit love shack the  sangthe love shack is a little old place where we can get togetherthe love shack was probably closed during the covid lockdowns last year like much else with most americans forced to stay home most of the time they poured money into home improvement one of the beneficiaries of that has been the lovesac company love they make couches called sactionals which feature customizable modular design and machine washable covers they also sell premium beanbagtype chairs called sacslovesac leading the packthe lockdowns have been a boon for the home furniture in general with ethan allen eth bassett furniture bset and dorel industries diibf all up triple digits over the past year but lovesack is up more than  since then outpacing even bitcoinwhat next for lovesacwall streets sellside analysts have been very bullish on the companychart via seeking alphaits worth remembering though that sellside firms are also in the business of selling stock and if lovesac is going to raise additional capital in the future they would want to be part of that and a company looking to do a secondary offering might be more likely to pick an investment bank thats been bullish on its stockour system estimates an  return for lovesac over the next  months so were perhaps not as bullish as wall street on this stock our modest potential return estimate is based mainly on our gauges of options market sentiment on love as of fridays close in the event were still too bullish and love ends up tanking over the next six months lets look at how longs can add some downside protection heredownside protection for lovesacwe usually hedge against  declines in these examples for two reasons its a large enough decline that the cost of hedging against one greater than that usually isnt too high and its a small enough decline that its not inconceivable your stock can eventually recover from it it only takes a  rally to recover from a  decline for example while youd need a  rally to recover from a  decline so hedging against  declines often makes sense assuming it fits your risk toleranceuncapped upside â€“ unavailablein the case of lovesac on friday it was too expensive to hedge against a  decline using optimal or leastexpensive put options over the next six months if you tried to scan for them you got this error messagethis and subsequent screen captures are via the portfolio armor appbasically the cost of protecting against a  decline in love with puts would have cost more than  of position value so it wouldnt have been optimalcapped upside negative costif you were willing to cap your possible upside at  over the same time frame this was the optimal collar to hedge against a  decline in love over the next six monthswith this hedge the net cost was negative meaning you would have collected a net credit of  or  of position value when opening it thats assuming to be conservative that you placed both trades at the worst ends of their respective spreads buying the puts at the ask and selling the calls at the bid in practice you can often buy and sell options at some price between the bid and askmight be worth considering in case the lovesac deflates over the next several monthsbenzingas related links
