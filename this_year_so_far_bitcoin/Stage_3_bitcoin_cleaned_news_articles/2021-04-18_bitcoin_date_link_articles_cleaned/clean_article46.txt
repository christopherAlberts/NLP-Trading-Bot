last year it recently hit a new peak of over  usd for a single btc rising by  in the first quarter of  aloneundoubtedly one of the main causes of this incredible bull run is that the pandemic has weakened traditional currencies and driven many to look at alternatives to help see them through the storm this has resulted in crypto investment by global financial institutions and major

termif you already own bitcoin you want to ensure that you don’t lose all your money if the price crashes again and you also want to put your profits to work on your behalf so they aren’t just sitting idle the safest and most profitable way to achieve this is with crypto arbitragewhat makes crypto arbitrage such a smart strategythere are a number of factors that make crypto arbitrage an attractive investment strategy let’s take a closer look at a few of the major benefitslow riskcrypto arbitrage is commonly used by institutional and retail investors alike because it is widely acknowledged to be one of the lowestrisk forms of investing the reason for this is that it does not leave you vulnerable to crypto market volatility instead you make a profit by exploiting temporary crypto exchange price inefficiencies these are instances where for a few minutes only a cryptocurrency will be available on different exchanges at different prices at the same time during that brief window you can buy the cryptocurrency on the exchange where it is offered at the lowest price and then instantly sell it on the exchange offering the highest available price before the market adjusts to compensate and the inefficiency resolves itselfminimal effortto find and take advantage of crypto arbitrage opportunities you would need to be able to track hundreds of coins on multiple exchanges at once and have splitsecond reaction times this is why investors use crypto arbitrage algorithmic trading software to do their trading for themto get a better idea of how it works let’s use arbismart  a popular eu licensed automated crypto arbitrage platform as an examplearbismart is connected to  different exchanges which it scans  hours a day to identify crypto arbitrage opportunities on multiple coins it

huge returns with arbismart offering annual profits that start at  and reach as high as  depending on the amount depositedfor example an investment of  btc which is currently equivalent to around  usd will have more than tripled in just three and a half years exceeding  usd in fact this calculation is extremely conservative for a few reasons firstly in addition to your profits from crypto arbitrage you will be making compound interest on those earnings also you will be earning capital gains on the rising value of rbis the platform’s native token which has already gone up by  in the two years since it was introducedwhen you sign up with arbismart your funds are automatically swapped into rbis for use in crypto arbitrage trading though they can be withdrawn in euro or btc at any time those who joined arbismart in early  have now more than tripled their profits from the growing value of the token and the coin is on track to rise far higher in  firstly the company has a number of new products and services set for launch in the second half of  including an interestbearing wallet adding new utilities for the token secondly rbis is in the process of becoming listed so in the coming months the token will be tradable on the exchanges which is likely to drive the price higher lastly the company’s crypto arbitrage platform is growing at a steady rate of  a year leading to greater demand for the token which has a limited supplywhat about the risks of entering the crypto spacehowever lowrisk your investment strategy any time you step into the crypto arena you are exposing
