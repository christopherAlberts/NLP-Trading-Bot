new york cnn business its been a weird year for seth meyers  in fact its been a weird year for all of late night tv not to mention the rest of uslike others in the late night world the host of nbcs  late night  had to adjust to the pandemic by working from home — an attic to be precise — when the pandemic first hit last springhes since moved back into his studio at rockefeller center but its still awkward since theres no audience there to laugh at his jokescnn business caught up with meyers to find out what hes learned doing a year of shows during a pandemic what he hopes itll be like when studio audiences return and if he ever took care of his attics wasp problem from last springthis interview has been edited and condensedlast time we spoke you were doing your show from what looked like an attic in either a stephen king novel or john carpenter filmmore king than carpenterdo you ever miss the atticno but when i go to the attic now which serves only as an actual attic and not a tv studio i do feel a sense of accomplishment and a fair bit of awe that we managed to do a show in those circumstancesyoure back in the studio without an audience what do you think the first show will be like when you have a studio audience againthat will probably be a far more jarring transition than anything weve gone through yet coming back to the studio was nothing but just what weve been doing so much easier because we were surrounded by professional staff againi thought oh my god going back to the studio is going to be so weird it was just delightful whereas when an audience gets back the show will just by necessity have a different rhythm to it that well have to relearn after so much time away from iton wednesday  gayle king asked you how youre doing without an audience you smirked and said youre so happy it seems like youre really enjoying being in a studio with just your crewi am really enjoying it now dont get me wrong i think i will love having an audience back but for right now and for this very impermanent time — knock on wood — that were living in its been really fun to do the show for  people every night knowing that at large youre doing it for a great many more people than thatbut having that same  people has creatively been pretty exhilaratingwhy is thati think its impossible to not have an ear for how things are working for the  people that are there night in and night out with that not being part of the equation you can sort of turn off the thing that any comedian has which is judging in real time how the materials goingif you work just as hard on the material as you always have and you are definitely writing and doing things that you personally think are funny and it seems as though people at home also still think its funny you just have more freedom to try things you dont have to worry about how  people on any given night might react to itdo you think youre the same host you were before the pandemicno but i would like to think i wasnt the same host a year before the pandemic started either i think ultimately to do these jobs the only way it works is if you can sort of evolve — and ideally not because of worldwide pandemics — but just because of the fact that over the course of any given year you should change some waysit was fun to make crazy choices that the audience understood because it was a time where we were all going crazy you know i think that if i had started talking to a sea captain painting in normal times that would have been when the phone would have rang from nbc asking can you just talk us through this joke whereas you do it during a pandemic and everybodys like yeah man ive been talking to paintings toowhat do you think the purpose of late night tv has been during this pandemici think its sort of the same purpose in that we try every night to fill people in on what happened its just that what happened became a little bit more universal because it was affecting everybodywhen youre a talk show host and not just me but my colleagues as well people really feel like they know you and through this year they felt like they knew us even more than before because they were seeing us in our homes they were seeing our children they were seeing our spouses and so if there is such a thing as a connection with a tv show i think that probably got strengthened this yearlast year you said that the attic had a wasp problem did you ever take care of thatwe did take care of it and then we got out just in time as the squirrels were arriving thats really the problem with an attic is you get rid of one nuisance and another one just arrives so im very happy that nobody had to watch late night with attic squirrels in the hot summer months
