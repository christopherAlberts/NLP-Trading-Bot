the global hysteria over bitcoin has caused concern about the connections between mining cryptocurrency and climate change as china has become a leading miner in the world recent research by chinese scientists was published to remind the cost of mining bitcoin on chinas carbon reduction efforts while some local governments have acted to tackle the mines in order to reduce the use of power in this fledgling industrybitcoin mining has exploded as the value of the virtual coins has surpassed  as of press time and some optimistic investors are expecting it to surpass  soonthere has also been a fever of mining bitcoin in china and with capitals joining in and bitcoin mining factories emerging china has become the worlds largest miner  research found that more than  percent of bitcoin mining happens in chinarecent research published earlier this month in the scientific journal nature communications has demonstrated the fact that bitcoin mining could potentially undermine the emission reduction effort in chinainside a bitcoin mining factory photo afpcooling the crazethe annual energy consumption of the bitcoin blockchain in china is expected to peak in  at  twh and generate  million metric tons of carbon emission correspondingly according to the research which was jointly made by researchers from the chinese academy of sciences cas and tsinghua universitychina announced its projection to reach its carbon peak in  and hit carbon neutrality by  researchers noted that this emission output would exceed the total annualized greenhouse gas emission output of some smaller countries such as the czech republic and qatarthe research drew international attention after being published some media outlets doubted whether the bitcoin mining industry might finally shake chinas targets on carbon peak and neutrality bitcoins soaring popularity could have a longlasting negative effect on the environment said cnnbut researchers reached by the global times said that the aim of doing such a study was to remind the world that a new industry as bitcoin blockchain could bring huge risks to the environment but they have faith in chinas wills to fulfill the goals on carbon issuesevery bit of energy is precious said guan dabo an expert of climate change economics at the department of earth system science tsinghua university told the global times guan is an author of the researchthough the industry remains a grey zone in many aspects the chinese government does not turn a blind eye to it and some local regions have begun to act north chinas inner mongolia autonomous region has announced to clear up all the bitcoin mines before may previously the region was the major hub for bitcoin mining due to the cheap electricitythe mines might relocate to other regions of china chasing low cost on electricitydalad banner a rarely heard of name for a small town with a population of  in inner mongolia had been bitcoin mining sacred land a large bitcoin mine here could make  yield of the worlds bitcoin mining every day in  banner belongs to ordos inner mongolia the region has a small population but is rich in energy in the past years wealthchasers poured into the citya cambridge study said that inner mongolia could account for  percent of the global bitcoin yield even higher than the us at  percent at the peak time there were  mining machines in ordos working nonstop and the electricity would amount to more than  million yuan  million a yearmoreover mining could barely contribute to the local economy some mining factories even applied for subsidies and electricity discounts some favorable government policies offered to hightech industries in the name of big data analysis the china youth daily reporteda photovoltaic power station in dalad banner ordos of north chinas inner mongolia autonomous region photo ica game of moneyas early as  inner mongolia has ordered its local governments to check and clear bitcoin minesand recently the region published a plan to completely close the mining projects of virtual currencies at the end of april and will strictly ban new similar projects it targets to reduce  percent of energy per gdp in the  fiveyear plan period  said that many mines in inner mongolia have moved to other parts of china  northwest chinas gansu province and xinjiang uygur autonomous region as well as southwest chinas sichuan provincethe relocation has shown its effect sichuan rich in hydropower is expected to see a  percent increase in electricity use in  as its bitcoin mining could use  billion kwh of electricity this year the local electricity trade department notedhowever though hydropower is considered as clean energy it does not mean china has spare electricity to power such a huge amount of bitcoin mining guan noted this past winter due to huge pressure from heating and postpandemic economic rehabilitation some parts of china experienced limited use of electricityauthors of the research noted that even though bitcoin mining is new it has to have a green attribution they also demonstrated suggestions for policymakers for better management of the industrybitcoin mining relies on secondary energy the industry itself can hardly lift its carbon reduction demand guan said noting that the industry is driven by capital its a game of money the miners are unable to think about environmental issues only profitsguan noted that bitcoin could help explore technology and practice digital currency in china but the current crazy situation has brought negative effectsbitcoin mining is a newlyfounded industry without any thought of low carbon it is currently developing on the route of pollute first manage later like many other industries in the past we would like to show people this guan saidwhat is behind bitcoin mining is blockchain technology which is widely regarded as one of the most promising and attractive technologies for a variety of industries such as supply chain finance production operation management logistics management the first author of the paper jiang shangrong a phd candidate at the school of economics and management university of chinese academy of sciences told the global timesjiang believes more vigilance is needed to better regulate this fieldphoto icstruggling for spacechina is determined to develop the blockchain industry vigorously how to make the industry develop toward a more sustainable and green direction is the problem this study wants to solve jiang notedthey considered three bitcoin regulation policies the first one is to ban inefficient profitmaking miners from chinas bitcoin mining market the second is to persuade mines in coalbased energy regions to move away to hydrobased energy regions and use hydropower to mine during sufficient water seasons the third is to double carbon tax and severely penalize high carbon emissions from bitcoin miningthe study found that the second policy for bitcoin miners are the most effective way to reduce carbon emissionsbut for now the storm in inner mongolia failed to shake gold diggersbitcoin is still appreciating and investors are increasing an anonymous bitcoin mining machine retailer told the global times local regions need to sell their electricity they wont totally close measures against big mining pools inadvertently brought extra opportunities for individual miners peter living in south chinas guangdong province said that the small miners like him might have higher income if the bigger miners are withdrawn by the countryeven mining machine manufacturers are making promisesthe industry should work together to promote a greener mining industry and work with local governments to achieve a winwin situation only in this way can the process of mining compliance be really promoted canaan one of chinas three largest mining machine suppliers and also the secondlargest global mining manufacturer saidaccording to canaan china has been occupying a leading position in the global bitcoin mining development three chinese mining machine manufacturers can supply the vast majority of the whole network computing powerbut some bitcoin experts believe the direction of these policies as well as the principle of bitcoins development could lead to another resulta worker checks on bitcoin mining equipment at a facility in the garze tibetan autonomous prefecture southwest chinas sichuan province file photo vcgin the context of chinas carbonneutral goal it can be said that the development space of the bitcoin mining industry is very small domestically as facing stricter environmental supervision energy costs and mining equipments operating costs will increase relative reduction of mining profits will limit the industrys development chen bo director of the digital finance research center at the central university of finance and economics told the global times on mondayat present it is difficult to successfully apply for a license to operate a bitcoin mining machine as chen learnedhowever the bitcoin mining industry itself has always been a highrisk highyield gray area in china as long as there are still profits to chase there will be people doing it chen believes that the energyguzzling industry will not disappear entirely and mines would be moved to areas where clean energy is cheaperaccording to chen many bitcoin mines have indeed been moved from inner mongolia to the yunnanguizhousichuan area in the past yearhowever as china deepens its transition to a lowcarbon economy and more industries increasingly demand for clean energy such as hydropower there wont be much hydropower left for the gray industry of bitcoin miningon the whole no provinces or cities are likely to welcome bitcoin mines for tax purposes anymore chen noted
