bitcoin has posted its biggest oneday drop in almost two months amid warnings that novice investors could suffer heavy losses from speculating in crypto assets such as “meme coin” dogecoinbitcoin tumbled more than  on sunday dropping from about  £ to  – its lowest level since the end of march last week the cryptocurrency had hit fresh record highs at nearly various reasons for the drop were cited which followed a strong rally last week bitcoin had already weakened on friday after turkey’s central bank banned the use of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets for purchases citing the risks of possible “irreparable” lossesdata website coinmarketcap also reported the blackout in china’s xinjiang region which reportedly powers a lot of bitcoin mining for the selloffthere were also unsubstantiated reports that the us treasury could be planning a crackdown on money laundering carried out through digital assets pointed out bloombergdespite the decline bitcoin was still up over

meme into a cryptocurrencythere is no cap to its supply unlike bitcoin which has a hardwired limit of about  coinsnigel green the chief executive and founder of the devere group financial consultancy compared dogecoin’s rally to the gamestop mania that gripped markets in january when retail investors organised on reddit launched a short squeeze on hedge fundsqa what is shorting or the shortselling of shares show the conventional way to make money from shares is to buy at a low price then sell at a high price it is called going long shorting is the opposite buying high and selling low the approach of hedge funds is to target a share they believe is heading for a fall but the only way to make a profit is by not really owning those shares in the first place rather “borrowing” them typically the hedge fund borrows them at a small fee from a pension fund that is holding them for the long term the investor speculator is probably a better word borrows say  bp shares and promises to return them at a fixed time – let’s say in a month the speculator instantly sells the bp shares at the going market price – say  giving them £ in a month’s time when they have to return the shares to the pension fund the shares have fallen to say  so the speculator goes into the market buys  shares for £ and hands them back making a profit of £ along the way but if the shares have risen to  they will make a loss of £ the reality is rather more sophisticated than this – speculators rarely take actual delivery of shares and use other methods such as cfds contracts for difference and short etfs exchange traded funds – but the principle is the same in january  the struggling texasbased video game store chain gamestop became the focal point of a battle between an army of small investors – using online chatrooms such as reddits wallstreetbets – who piled into the shares driving them skyhigh and wall street hedge funds which had been shorting the stock and made big losses other stocks and silver were also caught up in the trading frenzypatrick collinson and julia kollewe was this helpful thank you for your feedback“in the same way that the gamestop frenzy was pitched as a battleplay of ‘wall street versus the little guy’ dogecoin is being pitched as a battleplay against the wellestablished crypto giants like bitcoin” said green“we can expect many novice retail investors – who may not have the financial resilience needed – to get burned in the dogecoin frenzy in the same way they did with the gamestop one” green addeddemand for dogecoin briefly overwhelmed

added that traders should resist the “hysteria” driven by social media and look at the fundamentals of the different cryptocurrencies“it’s very hard to compare dogecoin with the likes of bitcoin which runs on groundbreaking tech and has a limited supply giving it scarcity value amongst other valuable attributes and ethereum which is solving realworld issues and providing indemand business solutions for these reasons amongst others they are attracting huge institutional investment” green said
