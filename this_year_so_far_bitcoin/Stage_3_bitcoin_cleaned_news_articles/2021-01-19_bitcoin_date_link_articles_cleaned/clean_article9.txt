bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have risen dramatically over the past year or so and many investors are wondering if they should put some of their money into these digital assetswhile there are clearly some investors who believe very strongly in bitcoins longterm potential were not so sure in this jan  fool live video clip foolcom contributor matt frankel cfp explains to intry focus financials host jason moser the three reasons he wont invest any of his own money in bitcoin especially at the current elevated pricejason moser well matt speaking of fintech and banking of the future and all that jazz weve seen over the past  hours we dont get into bitcoin very often on this show its not really what we cover here but by the same token weve seen bitcoin pull back considerably here over the last  hours i think its down somewhere in the neighborhood of about  here you have some opinions on the matter why dont you elaborate a little bit for usmatt frankel now youre going to make me be the bad guy againmoser well i mean ive got thoughts too but im going to go ahead and let you start frankel well for one well bitcoin is still several times more than it was at this time last year so its taking one of the greatest falls bitcoin hit over  a coin last week and has since pulled back a little bit over the past  hours alone its down about  right around  right before we started recording this regardless of your opinions of bitcoin this volatility first makes me tell you to be careful its a volatile asset there are three arguments that i often hear in favor of bitcoin i know i personally dont own any bitcoin ive mined bitcoin i actually mined about  coins in total back in  time framemoser wowfrankel i wish i still had them  maybe thats a little bitterness coming throughmoser possiblefrankel i understand the concept i understand how it works i understand the utility of it theres three main arguments that i always hear when people tell me i should own bitcoin one is that its scarce it has a limited amount and you cant make anymore my colleague sean williams has an article on foolcom right now that points out it would just take a majority of the bitcoin community to agree to raise that you could make more bitcoin i mean a majority consensus is why we have things like bitcoin cash the offshoot cryptocurrency not only that i checked right before we came on here there are  different cryptocurrencies that are officially recognized right now  of those  billion of cryptocurrency value is not bitcoin if bitcoin is getting too expensive and still valuable people can just use a different onemoser surefrankel theres a reason that theres over  billion in the second largest cryptocurrency i mean the scarcity argument i dont totally buy no  of the argument that its a store of value like gold for one forget about the scarcity thing where you cant make more gold but potentially there could be more bitcoin made forget about that i dont want a store of value that can fluctuate by  in a day thats not a stored valuemoser yeah i agree i mean im not interested in thatfrankel my savings account is a stored value because its value doesnt fluctuate i mean you could say that inflation over time it will fluctuate but not by  in a daymoser yeahfrankel this is why people i think it was venezuela that had a hyperinflation if im not mistakenmoser yeah i believe youre rightfrankel thats why people were storing value in that currency because it was very volatile and unpredictable at that pointmoser makes sensefrankel the stored value i think i dont really buy it at the moment its a volatile day when the us dollar moves by  in either direction against say the euromoser yeahfrankel if bitcoin got to that level of stability i might buy the stored value argument a little bit more but for the time being its not a stored value argument  that i get and this is the one thats going to be people really mad is that there is no real use case for it okay so let me give you one statistic you can spend bitcoin at about  merchants right now  different retailers that sounds impressive rightmoser i guess but out of a total number of whatfrankel if you just look at businesses that have at least one employee there are  million small businesses in americamoser yeah i was thinking thats where we are goingfrankel thats not a lot of penetration into the marketmoser nofrankel bitcoins been around for a decade now its been pretty well known everyone has at least know the term bitcoin since about  it hasnt proven as a useful currency over the us dollar especially with all these fintech innovations that were talking about with contactless payments i can pay by just tapping my phone on something i dont need actual us dollars to pay in us dollars anymore its become easy to transact in foreign currenciesmoser yeah absolutelyfrankel which one of the biggest use case for bitcoin as a currency is that it could be a worldwide universal currency now its easier than ever to switch from one currency to another i dont buy the use case for bitcoin i dont see widespread adoption happening i mean you could make the argument that paypal nasdaqpypl and square nysesq are onboard with bitcoin and paypal has said that it wants to make bitcoin usable at its merchants but i still dont see the benefit to converting my us dollars to bitcoin to be able to use them on paypal when i can just take my us dollars and use them on paypal i dont see the use case thats going to appeal to main street i get the early adopters who loved the technology and things like that i get why they see a big use case at it i really do but i dont see it translating to widespread mainstream adoption anytime in the next decade or moremoser just a reminder for all of our bitcoin bull listeners you can reach matt on twitter tmfmathguy thats tmf frankel i thought you were about to give out my address or somethingmoser i was just kidding no i wont do that listen just like i said we dont cover a lot of bitcoin on this show because it stands on its own it probably deserves its own hour i think you make a lot of good points there and im sure there are folks out there who would take the other side of the coin so to speak im with you im not saying there is not a use case im not saying its not special maybe it is you know what i dont care thats what it boils down to is i just dont care my time is better spent doing something else focusing on what i dofrankel yeahmoser i know what i dont know i just dont know enough about bitcoin to really even care i just leave it at thatfrankel like i said id make all those points with all due respect to the bitcoin fans people who love the technology i get it ive mined bitcoin ive used bitcoin i lived off bitcoin for a day just to see if it was possible  i get it but i just dont see the mainstream case for it at this pointmoser yeahfrankel i say it with all due respect
