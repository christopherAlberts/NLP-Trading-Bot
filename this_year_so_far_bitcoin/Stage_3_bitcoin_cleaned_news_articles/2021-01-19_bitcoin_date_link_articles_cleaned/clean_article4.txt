the incoming administration of joe biden has an opportunity to take the global lead in green mining for digital assets it is no secret that there is a geopolitical struggle brewing over new forms of cryptocurrencies – both statebacked and private – and the best location for new capital formation and technological advancements to win this global competition the new us government must ensure more regulatory clarity for digital assets while also ensuring that the mining process a tremendous drain on energy resources and a contributor to global warming is done in an environmentally sensitive waysome of the new administration’s leaders should work together to make policies to encourage development in this burgeoning industry the expected ascension of gary gensler a former chairman of the commodity futures trading commission to lead the securities and exchange commission augurs well for a more enlightened and proactive approach by regulators concerning digital assets after all he just finished teaching a course on blockchain at mit sees the technology as a “catalyst for change” and is viewed as a threat to the legacy financial system that’s all good for the disruptive financial technologiesjames cooper is a professor of law and associate dean of experiential learning at california western school of law he is moderating a panel for digital davos on jan  on ethics and technologies in developing countriesalso the naming of former secretary of state john kerry to a cabinetlevel position as special presidential envoy for climate is a signal of the new administration’s commitment to tackling global climate change he understands the importance of cryptocurrency at the world economic forum three years ago this week kerry was quoted as saying cryptocurrency has “got value” together these two appointees can ensure the country leads fintech development while preventing crypto mining from contributing to more greenhouse gasessubscribe to  by signing up you will

for the united states in  bitfury set up mining centers in paraguay home to south america’s biggest hydroelectric project – the itaipu dam – the world’s largest generator of renewable clean energy the government in asunción has backed the commons foundation’s golden goose project in its attempt to establish the region as the world’s largest crypto mining center but there is a challenge to keep the paraguay project itself from contributing to greenhouse gases given the intense heat that the tropical country faces year round it would be counterproductive to use a lot of energy to cool the computers even if the energy was being produced by renewable sourcessee also jeff bandman – what crypto can expect from gary gensler at the seccosteffective mining centers based on renewable energy have also been established in russia’s frozen lands of siberia the city of norilsk is home to the mineral mining behemoth norilsk nickel but increasingly bitcoin mining is becoming an important economic driver with temperatures in winter bottoming out at minus  degrees celsius which is roughly minus  degrees fahrenheit this is a perfect climate by which to keep computing machines cool it’s a lot cooler than paraguay for surenor should we forget about china the home to over half the bitcoin miners in the world the majority of whom are situated in sichuan due to low energy costs powered by hydroelectric facilities that the area has recently suffered some of the worst flooding in  years largely due to climate change shows that irony is as much at play here as hash rates poolin which controls the majority of btc hash rate has had trouble with consistent energy supplies and some of its mining farms have been inundated by monsoon floods even with the province’s vast hydroelectric capabilities the authorities in the people’s republic of china have generally banned the digital asset industry – shuttering mining exchanges and industry conferencesa more secure and geographically proximate project is rolling out near the churchill falls hydroelectric plant in labrador a remote part of eastern canada powre a montrealbased company with investors from asia is taking advantage of the stranded energy that nl hydro generates this hydroelectric facility is long past emitting mercury traces so the project meets many environmental protection and sustainable development goals the temperature rarely exceeds  degrees fahrenheit in the summer ensuring that the machines stay cool the only source of waste is heat – which is a luxury in the subarctic region where they are miningthe united states has much to learn from such foreign green mining projects there are some new initiatives to encourage bitcoin mining stateside including a new legislative bill in kentucky to provide state tax incentives but many of these are not green and may contribute to the earth’s warming coalfired power plants supply  of kentucky’s electrical generation for example dulling the greenness of that project ’s mining project in texas by contrast is prized for its environmental performanceand while bountiful and clean electricity are critical to providing hash rates that are cost effective and have little environmental impact so are champions in major policymaking positions the combination of gensler and kerry in the biden administration can help position the united states at the forefront of green mining president biden promised to “build back better” green mining is one such way private companies are getting in on this opportunity too square crypto recently announced a  million fund to promote projects that use green energy for bitcoin mining
