bitcoin energy consumption is far more efficient and greener than todays banking systemwhile bitcoin and a variety of digital currencies have swelled in value a number of critics have spread fear uncertainty and doubt fud in regard to the energy consumption proofofwork pow cryptocurrencies leverage to produce new units of currency just recently the software engineer stephen diehl expressed his dissatisfaction over the environmental cost of bitcoin however cryptocurrency supporters believe diehl failed to mention the amount of renewable energy used by a great number of mining facilities alongside the insurmountable cost to operate today’s banking systembitcoin’s waste of energy argument is a fool’s errandthe latest hot topic within the cryptocurrency industry is the topic of bitcoin’s proofofwork pow energy consumption and whether or not the consumption is efficient the conversation was sparked by a number of articles published during the last year alongside software engineer stephen diehl’s recent critique of the network’s power consumptionbesides the fact that diehl considers the crypto asset to be “a giant smoldering chernobyl” he also said that “bitcoin economics  a pyramidshaped investment scheme backed by the collective delusion that value can  created out of nothing by convincing greater fools to buy it after you do”diehl’s criticism toward bitcoin’s energy consumption is filled with obvious fallacies but he also doesn’t realize how satoshi’s cryptocurrency network is more energyefficient than most think diehl and many others also fail to recognize the cost to maintain today’s banking system which consists of a great number of terawatts dedicated to servers branches and automated teller machines bitcoin’s energy consumption is not “wasteful” – it is much more efficient than existing financial systems– no one has the moral authority to tell you what is a good or bad use of energy ex watching the kardashians lets debunk this fud👇 — dan held danheld january  bitcoin electricity consumption index discrepanciesmost of the consumption data stemming from the btc network is derived from the cambridge bitcoin electricity consumption index cbeci interestingly enough analysts and mainstream media reporters also reference the digiconomistnet bitcoin energy consumption index as well unfortunately both cbeci and digiconomistnet’s annualized consumption of terawatt per hour twh data has a very large discrepancythe digiconomistnet stats show the btc network captures  twh while cbeci indicates the network is  twh that is a huge variance  difference when attempting to estimate the data consumption of the crypto asset’s network yet these are the most leveraged sources used by bitcoin naysayers who say btc’s electrical consumption is a ‘waste’ without any shamefurther we don’t even know how accurate the cbeci data is because a team member from the cambridge centre for alternative finance ccaf recently explained to newsbitcoincom that the cbeci map is not uptodate and will be updated in  this has led to numerous reports stating that china captures  of the bitcoin mining hashrate which may be entirely inaccurate in july  a hashrate report written by bitooda said china was steadily losing its concentration of bitcoin hashpower and the country dropped to it is far more likely that cbeci’s theoretical lower bound estimate for the btc network’s energy consumption is more accurate this theoretical lower bound estimate is around  gigawatts or  twh annualized on january   moreover there are countless rebuttals and data points that show people complaining about bitcoin’s energy consumption are overreactingwe had the exact same debates about the perceived costliness of the gold standard i would direct the energy crew to go read those rebuttals instead of boring us with  yrold arguments — nic carter niccarter january  studies show over  of cryptocurrency miners leverage renewable energy sourcesfor instance the antibitcoin environmentalists do not weigh the fact that much of the pow mining industry uses renewable energy sources like hydropower wind solar and geothermal energy there are a number of reports that show over  of crypto miners use a mix of renewable energy to power facilities across the world there is also abundant efforts dedicated to energy cogeneration as wellthe  third global cryptoasset benchmarking study by the university of cambridge also indicates that  of digital currency miners use renewable power sources backing up this data is a report from deutsche bank research the chinese national energy agency morgan stanley and coinshares the report from these four organizations highlights that “ of bitcoin’s electricity usage is from renewables”there are countless reminders and realworld examples of bitcoin miners using a far more efficient means of electric use than all of the financial systems on the planet two years ago bill tai an investor and board director of bitfury detailed that satoshi is smiling because of the green energy use bitcoin miners use today“it’s been clear to me for years now that mining of bitcoin and other ‘proofofwork’ based cryptocurrencies are driving positive change in the underlying infrastructure of energy production — at an accelerating rate” tai explained at the time the investor is also the chairman of ’s board and he said the company has a “policy to ‘be green’ as we build” tai detailed that the most efficient sources of electrical power are not fossil fuelbased in order to scale but the marginal costs of water solar and windbased energy tai stresseddelivery trucks servers branches atms and the insurmountable cost of the modern banking systemthen ultimately there’s the cost of the modern banking system something that bitcoin naysayers never account for when they criticize the crypto’s energy consumption there is a great number of articles and statistics that indicate the current banking system uses well over  twh a year in one study katrina kellypitou a researcher who “studies clean energy technology specifically the transition toward decarbonized energy systems” says the energy conversation surrounding bitcoin is “oversimplified”furthermore the researcher stressed that “bitcoin’s energy consumption isn’t as bad as you think” then the hacker noon contributor carlos domingo called the comparison of bitcoin’s electrical usage to visa’s a complete “fallacy”domingo saidstop complaining about bitcoin and start complaining about xmas lightsdespite the fact that ‘the cost of bitcoin mining has never really increased’ cancel culture pundits want to ‘criminalize bitcoin’this past october the researchers yoder song and tomaso aste published a report which highlights that the cost of bitcoin mining “has never really increased” in the paper aste and song detail that the bitcoin network consumes a lot of energy but the researchers still manage to estimate the “lower bound for the global mining energy cost for a period of  years from  to ”“despite a  increase in hashing activity and a  increase in total energy consumption we find the cost relative to the volume of transactions has not increased nor decreased since ” the paper notesthe researchers addthis is consistent with the perspective that in order to keep the blockchain system secure from doublespending attacks the proof of work must cost a sizable fraction of the value that can be transferred through the network we estimate that in the bitcoin network this fraction is of the order of it is clear that the bitcoin mining industry is not as wasteful as the current banking system filled with not only servers atms and branches but it is also free of rampant fraud and manipulation as well despite this members of today’s woke crowd and cancel culture want to “criminalize bitcoin” because it is allegedly “grotesquely damaging to the environment” as usual these critics are filled with emotional opinions and weak virtue signals without a whole lot of facts to back them upwhat do you think about the recent critique toward bitcoin’s energy consumption let us know what you think about this
