cryptocurrencytaurus exchange which claimed to be canada’s first zerocommission bitcoin exchange bitcoin in a box coinfresh and vfs ventures and securities a cryptocurrency incubator were all founded – and later folded – in vancouver over the last decadebitcoinrelated businesses going dark can affect investors to varying degrees an extreme example is quadrigacx which a review by the ontario securities commission described as “oldfashioned fraud wrapped in modern technology” investors who used quadriga which had offices in vancouver collectively lost at least  million because of the fraudulent conduct of the company’s cofounderin bc einstein exchange was shut down after the bc securities commission bcsc began investigating complaints from investors who could not access their assets the company had less than  in cash and cryptocurrency but owed approximately  million to its customers according to the bcscwhile quadriga and einstein exchange are not representative examples of canada’s cryptoasset trading landscape the lessons for investors are clear know where you are investing your assets and how they will be kept safe“i think anybody who thinks about stepping into this forum and purchasing bitcoin as an investment – and i personally sort of hesitate when i think of the word investment and bitcoin a little bit at this point in time – they really should do their due diligence to understand who it is they’re dealing with what it is they’re actually purchasing and understand that there’s a significant amount of volatility in cryptoassets these days” said mark wang director of capital markets regulation at bcscthe regulation of how securities and derivatives are traded in british columbia falls under the jurisdiction of the bcsc that may include cryptoassets such as bitcoin depending on their characteristics and how those assets are bought and soldgenerally speaking wang said that if investors buy and receive bitcoin it is considered a commodity transaction and outside of the bcsc’s jurisdiction if however a customer buys the right to bitcoin that is held by a trading platform securities legislation applies in other instances where cryptoassets are considered securities or derivatives legislation applies regardlessthe ability to sell securities in bc comes with a host of obligations – including insurance and disclosure requirements – that in turn afford investors greater transparency“the very first thing that somebody should be looking at is whether  is regulated by the relevant securities regulatory authority” said zach masum bcsc’s manager of legal services in capital markets regulation and head of the commission’s fintech and innovation team adding that cryptoasset trading platforms may be subject to other regulations such as those that deal with money launderingto evaluate a trading platform masum recommends that investors do their due diligence by evaluating the platform’s principals their history the platform’s operations and its structure“in other words if you’re buying bitcoin on that platform and it’s safekeeping that for you you want to be sure that that’s an entity that you trust in order to keep your assets safe” he saidadam soltys creator of the opensource crypto wallet coinos and a member of vancouver’s now largely defunct bitcoin coop acknowledges the risks of owning a digital asset that is kept by someone elseit’s common he said for investors to keep their bitcoin stored on an exchange or on another server but doing so makes those assets vulnerable to a hack or a “big exit scam” by people who shut down access and take the assets for themselves“that’s happened many times over the years” soltys said “i always recommend people to get a paper wallet or hardware wallet make sure that you’re storing it yourself and you’re not trusting someone else to store them for you”despite the risks soltys is a firm believer in the benefits of bitcoin“it is going to be a good investment for people because it is immune to inflation and i think over time we’re just going to see more and more moneyprinting from our governments” said soltys pointing out that the amount of bitcoin is fixed – capped at  million according to bitcoinorgit is also portable secure in and of itself easily divisible down to  of a bitcoin and difficult to counterfeit“bitcoin is like the ideal form of money it has these unique properties that make it good for doing payments and for storing your wealth” soltys saidafter soltys spoke with biv an anonymous account exploited bugs in the coinos server code and withdrew  bitcoin worth nearly  as of january “there are still enough funds to cover everyone’s balances and i hope to return to service within a couple of days” soltys wrote in a message to the hundredplus unique users of the coinos wallet“what doesn’t kill us only makes us stronger”hwoodinbivcomhayleywoodin
