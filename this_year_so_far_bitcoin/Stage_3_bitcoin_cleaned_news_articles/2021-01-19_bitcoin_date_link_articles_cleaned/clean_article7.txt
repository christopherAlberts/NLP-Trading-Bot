a constantly changing narrative is a telltale sign that something is a bad investment the argument for bitcoin a few years ago was that it would replace fiat currencies like the us dollar it didnt and it probably never will no ones going to use a currency that wildly gyrates in value and isnt backed by anything at allnow bitcoin is apparently digital gold a store of value that can protect investors from inflation like real gold theres a finite quantity of bitcoin that can ever exist but unlike real gold there are an infinite number of potential competitors cryptocurrencies are a dime a dozen and theres really nothing special about bitcoin other than its name recognitionthe price of bitcoin has soared over the past year up from less than  at the beginning of  to nearly  today i would wager that most people buying bitcoin are doing so because the price is going up not because they actually believe in its utility thats what happens during a bubble  the rising price becomes the narrative the fear of missing out overwhelms rational thought and people concoct all sorts of post hoc justifications for investing in things with little to no substancetheres no telling how high bitcoin will soar before the bubble finally bursts plenty of people will make a lot of real money but many more will be badly burned you could ride the frenzy and hope to get out in time or you could invest in a leading company using the blockchain technology that underlies cryptocurrencies like bitcoin for realworld applications one such company is international business machines nyseibmthe blockchain leaderthe global market for blockchainrelated products and services is expected to grow from a mere  billion last year to nearly  billion in  according to projections from marketsandmarkets that estimate could be way off base but explosive growth is certainly a possibility the banking and financial services industries are expected to account for the largest portion of this spending over the next five years as blockchain technology is used to secure transactionsibm is an early leader in the blockchain space an analysis from everest group research performed at the end of  put ibm at the top of the pack in terms of market adoption and just behind microsoft in terms of ease of useibm has worked on over  blockchain projects so far notable projects includetradelens a blockchain platform that aims to digitize the global shipping industry tradelens had over  members using the platform as of march  including more than  ports and terminals more than  ocean carriers and intermodal providers and more than  government authoritiesfood trust a blockchain platform that tracks food throughout the supply chain the system aims to among other things greatly speed up the process of tracking down the source of foodborne illnesses companies using food trust include megaretailer walmart and nestle and  world wire a blockchain platform for moving money across borders world wire is capable of clearing and settling crossborder payments in seconds using cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a realworld currencywith the financial services industry expected to be a big customer for blockchain services ibms existing relationships with financial companies give the company a major advantage one example ibms mainframe systems handled nearly  of all credit card transactions as of  and the systems processed close to  trillion worth of payments annuallyshares of ibm have not performed well over the past few years as the company worked to shift its focus to growth areas like hybrid cloud computing artificial intelligence and blockchain that transformation is ongoing and the companys financial results havent been particularly impressive as of latebut ibm is positioned at the center of what could be an explosive growth market over the next five years if blockchain really does take off ibm will one of the biggest beneficiaries
