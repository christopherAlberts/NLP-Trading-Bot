state senator kevin s parker d new york joins the yahoo finance live panel to discuss the bill that he introduced to halt bitcoin mining in nyvideo transcriptakiko fujita climate concerns have accelerated the closures of coalfired power plants but some are finding new life in bitcoin mining thats only added to concerns about the environmental impact the industry is having one state senator in new york introducing a bill calling for a full review of the industrys impact on the environmentlets bring in that senator state senator kevin parker joining us today senator its good to talk to you today i guess its important to provide some context on this because there is one specific power plant greenwich generation in the finger lakes region thats been converted into a bitcoin mining facility it used to be a coalpowered plant now theyve said they use natural gas how much of the bill that youve introduced is to target specifically that project or to try and halt the other projects that could comekevin parker none of what weve actually put forward is about targeting any particular plan but the real context is that we have a climate change crisis not just in the state of new york or the country but in the world and the state of new york has actually passed the most audacious climate change goals literally in the country trying to reduce our carbon footprint by  by  and by  by  and so the clcpa the climate leadership and community protection act is really the context in which all of us operate in and what crypto mining is doing now really runs in violation of thatakiko fujita so the bill may not be targeting a specific project but there is an interesting dynamic at play here because a lot of these coalfired power plants have been threatened a lot of them have been forced to close and are now looking at a new way to continue operating how much of that is picking up steam beyond this specific project were talking about are you seeing more and more of these power plants trying to get into miningstory continueskevin parker well people are focusing on the moratorium part of this legislation and although thats important the real critical part of the legislation im putting forward with assembly member anna kelles is really a bill that provides a study around how crypto mining can be done within the context of our climate leadership goalsand so were not saying that were against crypto mining we would like to have crypto mining in the state of new york but it needs to happen in a way thats environmentally friendly and goes and operates in conjunction with our climate goals and our environmental aims for the statezack guzman well with all due respect i mean it does kind of sound like you are against it if you want to put a moratorium on it while the research is done there because it does sound like i mean the pushback that you hear from bitcoin miners all the time is that it matters what energy source is being used and if it is natural gas obviously the emissions is far better than coal there obviously itd be even better if it was solar or renewable powered energykevin parker thats rightzack guzman then why put the moratorium on ahead of the research there since it seems like it matters more about the energy source thats being used rather than it being bitcoin miningkevin parker because its not about the energy source this is really more about carbon and certain energy sources produce more carbon and we know that fossil fuels are dirtying our planet dirtying our atmosphere and creating a dynamic in which the planet is going to be uninhabitableand so what were saying is lets take a little time lets not manage anymore of these facilities operating on you know fossil fuels again which is in direct contravention of what were trying to do in terms of our climate change goals and lets look at you know how we can do more solar how do we do more wind turbines how do we do tidal power how do we do cogeneration and use other means that are cleaner in order to do this important workakiko fujita theres a number of estimates that are out there in terms of the energy that is consumed in bitcoin mining you had numbers out from the university of cambridge that said essentially when you look at the global mining number the energy usage has surpassed the usage in a country like sweden when you look specifically in new york how significant is that carbon footprint right now do you have a numberkevin parker again like what youre seeing globally were seeing different sets of numbers but we certainly all agree that the numbers are astronomical and it also is saying it also raising the level and the price of energy in those areas but i think that those kind of pricing issues we can kind of figure out more easily than the longterm impact of producing this level of carbonthese crypto miners have come in and taken over dirty peaker plants and these are plants that sometimes will be running for a couple of hours over the course of a month and are now running them  hours a day  days a week and not just dirtying the air but using the water in the great lakes to cool the plants and then pouring that water back into the lakes at over  degrees and so we certainly cant continue to allow this ecological disaster to befall the state of new york endanger our great lakes and endanger everybody in the stateakiko fujita i want to follow up on the question that zack asked about what the energy source should be and i realize this bill is about conducting the study first when you look at what the climate goals of the state are do you see a scenario where bitcoin mining can continue to run on natural gas or does it have to be all renewable energy because at the end of the day natural gas may be cleaner but theres still emissionskevin parker yeah look as the chair of the energy and telecommunications committee in new york state senate i certainly see natural gas as a bridge fuel to how we get to all  and  goals and so i think in the meantime there can be some limited natural gas done but we certainly want a longterm solution and we certainly want these plants that come in with longterm plans to have as sustainable energy sources as possible and again battery storage solar wind water are all great alternatives and we want to work with these crypto miners to do what is right both for their business but also for the people the great state of new yorkakiko fujita state senator kevin parker appreciate you joining us today
