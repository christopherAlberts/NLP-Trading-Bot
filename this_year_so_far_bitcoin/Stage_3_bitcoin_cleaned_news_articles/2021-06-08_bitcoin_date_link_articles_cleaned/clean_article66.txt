news brief jan  report recovering bitcoin ransom alzheimers drugsenators release new details of the us capitol attack the fbi recovers millions in ransom paid to end a cyberattack on colonial pipeline the fda approves a drug to treat alzheimers diseaseleila fadel hosta bipartisan group of senators is out with new details on the january  attack on the us capitolrachel martin hosttwo committees worked together to look into what happened but democratic senator gary peters the chairman of the homeland security committee says the scope was narrowgary peters it was focused on the facts and its focused on recommendations that can be implemented as quickly as possible but all of us know that theres more work that needs to be donemartin how that work will happen is still up in the air last month senate republicans blocked an effort to launch a bipartisan commission to investigate furtherfadel npr congressional reporter claudia grisales is following this and joins us now hi claudiaclaudia grisales byline good morning leilafadel so what are these new details what did the committees discovergrisales they found that capitol police and other agencies were in possession of even more alarming clues to the attack that were ultimately ignored among those a website touting a reelection win for former president donald trump and it included comments that quote this is do or die bring your guns and to be prepared to drag down police and they also said they could enter the capitol like a militia group and quote certify the trump electors a capitol police official had also shared an online tip received by the fbi national threat operation center of a significant uptick in new visitors to a website called washingtontunnelscom but ultimately that information didnt get to top leaders of the agencyfinally we heard more extensively from defense department officials interviewed behind closed doors this includes the thenacting defense secretary chris miller and the chair of the joint chiefs of staff general mark milley and they asked if the permits for the thousands of demonstrators that day could be revoked ahead of january  and if dc could be locked down but those proposals were not pursued furtherfadel wow i understand the senators didnt get all the information though that they had requested during their investigationgrisales thats right federal agencies such as the justice department and homeland security only shared partial answers to all of the committees inquiries and the panels leaders such as senator gary peters expressed disappointment and also the house sergeantatarms  this is a top security official in that chamber  was reluctant to participate and this could be tied to the fact that this was a senate probe and the chambers are working on separate tracks so its a reminder of the obstacles that these congressional probes still face and some say its an argument for the need for a  commission or committee that can subpoena these witnesses but as we know the senate fell a few votes short last month to get legislation going to create one of these commissionsfadel right so after this investigation what are the committees recommendationsgrisales they laid out  of those recommendations and one of those requires a legislative fix to allow capitol police to allow its chief to unilaterally call for emergency backup and not face delays as a result of seeking approvals from the agencys oversight board like we saw that day senate rules committee chair amy klobuchar and the ranking republican roy blunt plan to introduce that bill also this report could provide the foundation for a senate proposal on a supplemental security funding bill heres senator rob portmanrob portman it will be very helpful to have this report out there to  you know a factbased way and a bipartisan way to lay out what the needs are so that the appropriations is appropriate on equipment on training on recruitment on other thingsgrisales and this comes after the house passed a  billion version of that plan so this could trigger talks with the senate and also comes as house speaker nancy pelosi is considering whether to move forward to some type of select committee to investigate the attack or additional probes in the housefadel nprs claudia grisales thank yougrisales thanks for having mesoundbite of musicfadel the fbi has recovered millions in ransom paid to end a cyberattack on one of the nations largest fuel pipelinesmartin right so colonial pipeline paid about  million worth of bitcoin to end the attack last month us officials say they recovered most of that from a virtual walletfadel npr justice correspondent ryan lucas joins us now with more hey ryanryan lucas byline good morningfadel so how did investigators track down this money and get it backlucas well us officials say a criminal hacker group called darkside was behind this ransomware attack against colonial last month darkside is based in russia and the group provides ransomware to criminal actors who use it to take control of the victims computer system and demand a ransom to unlock it and darkside then gets a share of the proceeds from that the fbi says that it has been investigating darkside since last year and based on that investigation the fbi identified a digital wallet that darkside used to collect and hold the ransom payment from colonial and the fbi then got a warrant to seize those funds in this case it was  million in bitcoin deputy attorney general lisa monaco said the department had turned the tables on darkside and she applauded colonial for quickly contacting the governmentsoundbite of archived recordinglisa monaco the message we are sending today is that if you come forward and work with law enforcement we may be able to take the type of action that we took today to deprive the criminal actors of what theyre going after here which is the proceedsfadel so has colonial said anything about the recovery of most of their ransom moneylucas well the companys president put out a statement in which he thanked the fbi for its work he said that right after this ransomware attack happened colonial behind the scenes kind of quietly and quickly contacted the fbi in atlanta and san francisco and he said the feds were instrumental in helping the company understand the hackers and what the hackers were up to and what their tactics werefadel so it seems like were talking about ransomware a lot these days so what else is the justice department doing to try to get a handle on this type of cyberattacklucas there have been absolutely a lot of highprofile ransomware attacks as of late right after the colonial pipeline one the worlds largest meat processing company jbs was hit with a ransomware attack heres lisa monaco againsoundbite of archived recordingmonaco ransomware attacks have increased in both scope and sophistication in the last year targeting our critical infrastructure businesses of all types whole cities and even law enforcementlucas now that law enforcement reference there at the end hits close to home because the washington dc police department was the target of a recent ransomware attack so this is a growing menace monaco described it as a national security and economic security issue the justice department recently created a ransomware task force to focus on this problem to investigate and prosecute the cybercriminals behind these sorts of attacks this colonial ransom recovery operation was actually the task forces first operation of this kind but the biden administration writ large is also focused on this issue officials say a lot of these groups operate out of russia with sort of a  the tacit approval from the government there president biden plans to raise this issue with russian president vladimir putin when the two meet next week in geneva so this is an issue that is very much front and center right nowfadel nprs ryan lucas thank you ryanlucas thank yousoundbite of musicfadel the fda has approved the first new drug to treat alzheimers disease in nearly  yearsmartin which sounds like great news right but the price tag of this drug is expected to be about  a year thats about the yearly salary for an experienced teacher in columbus ohio or the annual pay for a rookie cop in san antonio texas and the cost isnt the only thing that has raised some concern some doctors and scientists say the research just isnt there yet to prove that this drug actually worksfadel so here to talk about the controversy is npr science correspondent jon hamilton hey jonjon hamilton byline heyfadel so tell us about this drug what does it actually dohamilton well the drug is called aduhelm and it is the first approved drug that does more than just relieve the symptoms of alzheimers this drug actually affects the underlying disease process by reducing the amount of sticky amyloid plaque that builds up in the brain the catch is that removing this plaque may not help patients avoid memory loss so one big study showed that it did another showed that it didnt and an advisory panel to the fda actually voted against approving this drug so theres been a lot of public debate about the decisionfadel so two studies coming to two different conclusions the advisory panel saying dont approve it so why did the fda decide to ignore that advicehamilton the agency published a pretty detailed explanation of their thinking which is unusual and it was remarkable for what it did not do it never tries to argue that aduhelm actually works to preserve someones thinking or memory instead it focuses on what has been shown which is that the drug can remove plaque from the brain and they argue that a drug that can remove plaque is reasonably likely to slow down the disease even though the studies so far havent confirmed that the other point the fda made was that there is no other treatment for this disabling fatal disease that affects about  million people in the us so they said that justifies giving aduhelm something called accelerated approval which means the drugs makers have to conduct another study after the product is already on the marketfadel so whats been the reaction so farhamilton theres been a lot of love theres been a lot of hate and theres been some celebration among investors who think aduhelm is going to make a lot of money i spoke to dr richard hodes the director of the national institute on aging he did not directly question the fdas decision but he did suggest that drugs to remove amyloid drugs like this one may be the wrong approach to stopping alzheimersrichard hodes people who work in the field regard amyloid as one component of the pathology underlying disease but not the only one of the niasupported clinical trials its only a minority in fact that are currently targeting amyloidhamilton another reason the nih is looking elsewhere is that there have been large clinical trials of a couple of dozen amyloid drugs over the past  years or so and they all failed to help patientsfadel now there must be some people who feel hopeful who support the fdas decision righthamilton theres been a lot of support from doctors who treat alzheimers patients and from patient groups i talked with harry johns the ceo of the alzheimers association he told me they see aduhelm as a small first step you know much like the first drugs for some other diseasesharry johns hypertension hivaids  not perfect treatments but have stimulated other investments that then become so important to advancing the cause so part of what hes arguing there is that approving a drug like aduhelm might encourage the development of other drugsfadel all right nprs jon hamilton thanks jonhamilton thank youcopyright ©  npr all
