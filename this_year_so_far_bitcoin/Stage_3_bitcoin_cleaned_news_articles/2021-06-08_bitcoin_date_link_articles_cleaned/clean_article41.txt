greetings from an overcast z√ºrich where i will be taking part ‚Äì in person ‚Äì on a panel ‚Äúwhat the media thinks about digital assets  blockchain‚Äù which is obviously a wideranging topic where i can underscore the importance of remaining agnostic in our nascent industryfor those of you following my recent and rather challenging travel exploits it was a miracle i actually made it i‚Äôd also like to thank my friend jimmy nguyen of the bitcoin association for the invitation to take part and for respecting my independent views now i have to run to get some trousers as being a right donald i forgot to pack anyto watch this conference online you can register here ‚Äì my panel will be on thursday  june at  csetcrypto at a glanceyesterday we spoke of a sense of ‚Äòcalm before the storm‚Äô in the crypto markets it seems that sense was indeed correct though the simple joy of being right is somewhat negated by the double digit drops across the boardbitcoin has again found strong support at just above  this morning after dropping  per cent over the last  hours while ethereum eth has also again managed to again bounce back at  following a similar fall in price will they be able to sustain another recoveryit feels like a long time ago that bitcoin was trading at around  though it was actually less than a month ago now but while recent price crashes have been defined by the surrounding fud this is somewhat remarkable in that it comes enveloped in rousing adoption news for bitcoin and bullish fundamentals for ethereumthe president of el salvador‚Äôs announcement over the weekend that

the laser eyes meme is supposed to be an endorsement of the leading cryptocurrency sparking rumour that more countries will follow el salvador‚Äôs lead can the bombastic tweets of a wannabe space mogul really move the market more than adoption by a sovereign nationyesterday also saw more bullishness when former us president donald trump gave a backhanded endorsement of bitcoin giving it apparently accidental credibility by describing his fears that it was a ‚Äúcurrency‚Äù that could rival the us dollarthe latest dip took the overall market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined below
