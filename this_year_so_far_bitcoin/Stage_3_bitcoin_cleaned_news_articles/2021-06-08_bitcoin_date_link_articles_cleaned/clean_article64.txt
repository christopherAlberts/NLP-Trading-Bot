mike novogratz galaxy digital founder and ceo joins yahoo finances zack guzman at the  bitcoin conference to discuss the latest in the cryptocurrency industryvideo transcriptmike novogratz well listen first of all sustainability is a big issue for the whole planet not just for the crypto industry or the bitcoin mining industry and when we look at it in context i think our community needs to do something just like every other community does traditional bankingyoutube uses  and  percent of all electricity thats a crazy statistic youtube were not going to ban youtube youtube is awesome i will literally bow down at the altar of youtube theres unbelievable utility from ittheres also unreal utility from the bitcoin blockchain it cost a lot to mine it uses a lot of electricity because it was designed that way if we want something to secure trillions of dollars of wealth you dont want a guy with a popgun right you want a robust systemand so i think its inherent on the communities the community to be responsible to move our industry like all industries towards a greener future and i think youre going to see all kinds of initiatives come out soonzack guzman all weekend ive been hyping you up as the warren buffett of crypto which is ironic because we all know his take on crypto but youre involved in so many different areas i dont know if its a fair comparisonmike novogratz well i am the oldest guy in crypto and so maybe warren is maybe the oldest guy in traditionally well charlie munger listen we decided at galaxy that we wanted to be an ecosystem company and the thesis was lets take our own money it started as my family office and its now a public companyour own money invested in the coolest projects the cutting edge technologies in coins in custody solutions you name it were trying to invest in it and we want to take the understanding we learn and then transmit that to our clients our clients from the investment banking division our asset management division our sales and trading clientsstory continuesand so what i found is everybody enters this space goes on a similar journey they start with bitcoin whoa this is pretty cool and they might have different opinions is it going to be digital gold or decentralized moneyand then theyre like whoa whats that ethereum thing and as they go down this path of understanding how this ecosystem lays out we couldnt have any nft without satoshi a lot of the artists dont think theyre bitcoiners they are everyones a bitcoiner in this whole ecosystem because satoshis white paper gave us this brilliant of onesentence takeaway it was the first digital signature you couldnt counterfeitzack guzman yeah it was the spark that kind of lit the whole fire there and its an onramp for a lot of different technologies but you similarly i guess have built galaxy as the onramp for a lot of institutions and youre also kind of in the way that this billiondollar deal more than  billion deal with bitgo really increases your guys connections with some of those more established investorsi mean talk to me about how that changes the landscape because some people might say that we got to  in bitcoin or above it because of institutional money coming in how important is itmike novogratz institutional money is wildly important so let me give you some numbers total crypto market cap thats bitcoin and everything else is about a trillion and a half dollars thats  basis points of total global wealth  basis points nothinglisten for that to shift to   which im fundamentally of the belief that it will you need institutions they own all the money and so bitcoin is still a  retaildominated ecosystem maybe a little less maybe  but as institutions are slowly moving inthey take time they dont wake up one night and say hey buy me yards of bitcoin i mean unless theyre elon right they put a little in they do the same thing everyone else has done on this thingthey put something on the board so they start understanding it more then they get more confidence and what youll see is youll see higher prices when we get more people entering the marketzack guzman yeah it sounds like were kind of stuck now in this  range when it comes to that and some people might point to the esg concerns that institutional investors have as maybe a problem to get back to where we were before i mean do you see that playing out or how big of an issue is itmike novogratz so what happens in markets is you get a new group of investors that come in they get excited and then they push the market higher so if you think about when paul tudor jones bought bitcoin and he famously published that paper i think bitcoin was about  or a lot of hedge funds got in at that zone well a year later its at  the urge to ring the cash register is such a deepseated human urge that thats what happens people made a lot of money in something they sell some they sell some to buy a house to buy their girlfriend a ring to diversify their portfolio so theyre not  bitcoin rightand so we see these kind of step function moves and then well see a long period of consolidation and what happens there youre turning over old guys selling new guys buying and youre waiting for the new narrative to arrive that brings the next wave of money in and i think were in one of those periods right nowzack guzman when we look beyond bitcoin to obviously theres a lot of enthusiasm in defi and some other chains i know you guys have invested in a lot of very cool projects tare is one that weve discussed to you before i mean how important is that maybe i dont want to say its stealing the attention away from bitcoin but maybe the enthusiasm there for what the future looks like in attracting capitalmike novogratz listen the way markets work is when energy pushes them up supply responses happen what happened in  is everyone thought everything was bitcoin litecoin was the poor mans bitcoin right ethereum was the better bitcoin floyd mayweather coin was the boxing bitcoin and so you had this giant supply response which collapsed pricesthis time around weve learned some but not enough right you can differentiate the type coins right there are store of value coins i put bitcoin in that but id also put litecoin and dogecoin and i think those things pull away from bitcoin
