safehaven assetis bitcoin the digital goldshould you invest in gold or bitcoingold the safehaven assetgold has been around for centuries people value gold because its a source of security that has been tested over time while bitcoin hasnt been around during a major financial crisis like the great recessiongold is a wellregarded asset widely used by investment professionals central banks major governmental institutions pension funds and astute family offices will always have an allocation to gold says edward karr founder at us gold corp ticker usausome investors like to think of gold as insurance for their money if there is a concern about a nations currency or if theres an economic collapse people usually flock to gold because it benefits in times of crisisfor gold it has over  years of history on its side and isnt going anywhere which means it is super safe says john carter ceo and founder of simpler tradingwhile gold prices have experienced volatility similar to stocks in the short term over time the precious metals value has remained stable since were living during a time with a lot of market volatility it can make sense to have a portion of your portfolio allocated toward goldgold prices can benefit from inflation which makes it a great inflation hedge when prices rise the value of fiat currencies decreases and golds value rises because investors put their money into the precious metal to protect their purchasing powerbut since gold doesnt pay interest or dividends some may wonder if the commodity is worth the investmentgold does not provide any sort of recurring income compared to other asset classes like real estate income from rental properties or stocks income from dividends says ricardo pina founder and ceo at the modest walletthere are other downsides to consider costs of storing large quantities of the precious metal can be quite high low liquidity creates large spreads and in some cases it can be hard to verify the purity and legitimacy of the gold source pina sayswhile this may be seen as a disadvantage the point of gold isnt income carter says it is to preserve wealth during times of uncertaintyultimately experts say if youre looking for a safehaven asset that is negatively correlated to other assets gold has an important role in the stability of your portfolio as a buy and hold investment it also acts as a diversifier inflation hedge and capital preserver all of these benefits can result in positive returns over timethere are several ways to purchase gold investors have the option of buying physical gold bullion or gold coins which usually have a higher barrier of entry or you can purchase gold equities or exchangetraded fundsbitcoin digital goldbitcoin is the worlds largest cryptocurrency by market capitalizationunlike the stock market which is open for trading during the week from  am to  pm est the cryptocurrency markets allow users to trade bitcoin and other digital assets  hours a day seven days a weekone of the key features of bitcoin is that it has a fixed supply which means there will only ever be a maximum of  million bitcoins in circulation given the fixed volume of the asset if there is continued demand for the cryptocurrency the value of bitcoin will theoretically increase â€“ but there is still no guarantee for thatsimilar to gold and other precious metals bitcoin derives much of its value from its limited supply and growing consumer demand says edmund mccormack founder and ceo at dchainedthat said the reality is that bitcoin prices have experienced extreme volatility within the past month alone bitcoins price has fallen from nearly  in the beginning of may to about  in early junefurthermore bitcoin hasnt been widely adopted yet which has investors wondering what degree digital currencies will be accepted in the future as a result there is speculation about where bitcoins price is goingbitcoin has been a tremendous speculative asset and its longterm correlation to other portfolio asset classes still needs more time to work out due to bitcoins high volatility karr says noting the cryptocurrency is an emerging asset class thats only about  years old given bitcoins short time in the market the asset doesnt have a long performance track record as gold doesas a volatile and risky asset bitcoins massive price swings may be difficult for the everyday investor to take this volatility stems from a range of events from chinas crackdown on cryptocurrencies to elon musks tweets on the digital asset despite these setbacks experts say bitcoin could play an important role in your portfoliocoupled with its low correlation against gold and the us dollar bitcoin creates an opportunity to add further diversification and upside exposure in todays market mccormack saysanother popular feature of bitcoin is the blockchain technology that powers it this revolutionary technology is changing the way we transact with one another blockchain acts as an intermediary of monetary exchange between individuals eliminating the middleman like banks and other financial institutions and empowering a decentralized marketfor investors intrigued by this new asset class its decentralization and transformative technology you can join crypto exchanges like coinbase coin binance cash app and others to invest in bitcoinshould you invest in gold or bitcoinas we move toward a cashless society and digital currencies become more prevalent its reasonable to consider whether a new asset class like bitcoin is worth investing inid personally prefer to use bitcoin as opposed to gold in my portfolio as bitcoin is truly decentralized there is a finite supply and i can use bitcoin to transact with anyone from anywhere in the world pina saysbut its also important to consider the proven merits of gold because gold is more of a pricestable asset you dont need to transact with it unless you decide to change your investment strategy bitcoin on the other hand may require a different investment approachsince bitcoin is a volatile asset investors may want to have an entry and exit strategy if the price fluctuations become a risk in the case where the value of bitcoin moves to your advantage investors will also need to decide when and if to take some profitsif youre wondering which asset to choose gold or bitcoin carter says it depends on your investment goals the case for bitcoin is speculative given that it doesnt have much utility yet
