the properties inherent to bitcoin are deterministic not probabilistic and rely on the natural laws which make up our worldeverything in the observable universe is ultimately governed by the laws of physics this includes everything from observable phenomena at the cellular and molecular level to what we can observe in the most distant of galaxies at its most simplistic level this centers around energy and energy as a state of matter something that cannot be created or destroyed only transferred between entities first law of thermodynamicsone of the least thought of ways that energy is present in our world today until the advent of proofofwork in bitcoin is how the concept of energy applies to money despite this monetary energy is arguably the single most important practical implementation of energy transfer in the world today because it’s the signal of all of the work that people individually and collectively output transferred from our physical selves into the world as a practical example — to build a bridge it takes work from the people that are building that bridge as they are transferring energy in the form of physical labor to build that bridge and are expecting energy in return in the form of getting paidthe distinct problem that we have today is that the monetary energy in the world is fundamentally distorted to the point where the signal is completely broken central banks have routinely bailed out cantillon insiders and distorted the real cost of capital through interest rate manipulation this has caused all understanding of monetary value to be lost monetary energy can only function optimally in a totally free uninhibited market the further distorted the markets become the less “real” signal the monetary energy produces and therefore real productivity becomes more distorted from that signalpractically what this means is that monetary energy can no longer be transferred across time in a reliable manner salability of energy is a key factor in not distorting the monetary energy because i need to know that my purchasing power is going to be worth relatively the same today as it will tomorrow otherwise it will naturally force me up the risk curve to try to preserve my monetary energyhow do these ideas circle back to physics as mentioned above one of the key concepts of physics is thermodynamics the third law of thermodynamics states that a system’s entropy naturally approaches a constant value as it approaches absolute zero that is the lowest limit of the thermodynamic scale randomness in systems tends toward the thing that can create order out of disorder for monetary energy this would mean seeking the highest signal out of the noisebitcoin combines the first and third law of thermodynamics it is an entirely emergent system borne out of maximum disorder this isn’t just theoretically true it’s practically true as evidenced by the state of the fiat worldultimately bitcoin will absorb the majority of the store of value energy on the planet because it has the hardest monetary properties salability fungibility censorship resistance and proofof work proofofwork being the most important of these because it satisfies the first law of thermodynamics and therefore guarantees that the third law of thermodynamics brings the majority of the monetary energy existent into the networkbitcoin isn’t a perfect monetary system it’s simply the best monetary system the world has ever seen this is why on a long enough time scale the majority of the world’s monetary energy will be stored on the bitcoin network it’s simply the natural laws of the universe that make this inevitablethe shortterm exchange rate will fluctuate often dramatically as the world assigns various probabilities to the ultimate accrual of monetary energy by the hardest monetary network ever created but bitcoin doesn’t work based on a probabilistic function it works based on a deterministic one the shortterm exchange rate represents the discounting that the world’s population is collectively placing on the laws of thermodynamics playing out however anyone that understands these fundamental truths knows that the conclusion is built into the protocol and the emergent systems that develop around the protocolwhile hodlers wait on the world to get caught up they can rest easy knowing that bitcoin succeeding isn’t a human question it’s a question of energy transfer of entropy and the laws that we know emerge from those guarantee its ultimate successthis is a guest post by mindmatter opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of btc inc or bitcoin magazinethe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc
