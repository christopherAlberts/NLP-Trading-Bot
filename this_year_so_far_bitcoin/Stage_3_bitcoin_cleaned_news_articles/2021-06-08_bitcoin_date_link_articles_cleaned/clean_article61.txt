silencethere was no baseball on monday night at least not for new york fans hence more time to read more time to spend with my charts a stillness almostmy brain craves something it does not see there are no puzzle pieces that fit neatly together sure the nasdaq composite has put together two consecutive winning sessions after not doing so for nearly a month and on higher trading volume than the day before thats constructive the sp  the dow industrials and the dow transports were all slightly lower by days end those transports have now followed four consecutive winning sessions with four consecutive losing sessions and now must retest monthold support thats potentially less than constructive note that the bottom four performing sectors of  on monday were all cyclical typesi dont think well find what we seek through the study of largecap equities at least not at the moment major market moves await clarity on the future of the still upintheair infrastructure non deal specifically and the future of us fiscal policy more broadly until then the action is in the us treasury market domestic smallcaps and in cryptocurrency markets lets explainfirst up demand for securities out at the longer end of the us treasury yield curve has ratcheted up since the bureau of labor statistics reported weakerthanhoped employment data for a second consecutive month i have tried to explain this as i do not see the data being nearly as awful as most economists apparently do readers need to probably already do understand that my opinion is not mainstream on this i am apparently an outlierthe us  note went out on monday night paying just  and has flirted with  here on tuesday morning which is where that yield bottomed on friday keep in mind that the us treasury goes to auction with  billion of new  paper tomorrow wednesday afternoon hopefully indirect bidders ignore janet yellen tomorrow as much as traders in the secondary market did on mondaythe other two financial arenas gathering attention are doing so perhaps for reasons certainly tradeable but perhaps less investable over the long term smallcaps have been hot as the russell  is the domain of the meme stocks that have captured the imagination of both retail traders and the highfrequency algorithmic traders that prosper when that group is provoked not to mention takeover target us concrete uscr  this is where youll find the likes of amc entertainment amc  gamestop gme and bed bath  beyond bbby  among otherslastly is the bitcoincryptocurrency story evolving perhaps more quickly than many innocent investorsspeculators may be ready for lets discuss that right nowpeekabooi see you hmm readers may recall that i had often written on the likelihood that globally central banks and national treasury departments would eventually crack down hard on cryptos we have seen this in china not so aggressively as of yet elsewhere i had also expressed some surprise at the muted reaction of the federal reserve bank and us treasury department clearly with the most to lose in terms of power should a shadow economy evolve outside of the us monetary base thus stripping any global advantage wielded through sustained reserve currency statusgiven that cryptocurrency demand had along with legitimate or innocent investorstradersspeculators become the domain of hackersdrug dealersterroristsmoney launderers and the like readers will recall that i suggested some time ago that perhaps the only reason that us authorities had not yet cracked down on cryptocurrencies was because the us had learned or was learning how to track and maybe even identify those involved and that intelligence was considered more valuable for now than any gains made by heavily regulating a financial arena that was thought to be anonymous thought to be untraceableon monday deputy fbi director paul abbate in a justice department briefing communicated that the us had recovered  bitcoin of the  bitcoin ransom that colonial pipeline had been forced to pay in may in response to demands made by darkside a cybercrime group thought to be operating out of russia abbate announced that us authorities had identified a virtual wallet and without going into great detail said the funds had been recovered unfortunately for colonial the bitcoin recovered is obviously worth less than it was at the time the ransom was paid abatte also said the investigation revealed that more than  companies had been victimized just by this one group of hackers alonethis is precisely what i was trying to tell readers earlier this year the fact that the country with perhaps the most to lose should the world find a way to go around fiat has not taken action had to mean that they were uncloaking what had been invisible and tracking what had previously left no tracks to follow in other words the good guys had started to figure out how to trace and follow blockchain technologydoes this mean that cryptocurrency valuations will soon go straight to zero no for one while even if a transaction might be traceable and a portion of the funds recoverable there are still no consequences without international cooperation that however will evolve over time i thinkreaders will note that bitcoin in us dollar terms has bounced off of support at roughly  twice since peaking in midapril this just happens to be a  retracement of the julythroughapril rally once again our favorite  century italian mathematician has made his presence felt this should not really surprise given that technicals are the only way to trade an unproductive asset with absolutely no fundamental value whatsoeverdoes this mean that precious metals specifically gold will reclaim the title as the lead alternative exmoney supply investment vehicle thats hard to say while it is clear that price not value is simply based on broad public belief much as it is for fiat currency itself gold or any precious metal is or can be physical it can be stored it can be worn an actual productive use it hurts if you drop a large enough amount of it on your foot and it is still there the day the lights go outthe value of bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency in my opinion is that it eventually will either fall to the level of legitimate noncriminal demand or rise to the level of broad acceptance as legitimate noncriminal use as global and legal tender now understand that as we talk of a digital yuan and the federal reserve and european central bank discuss such an idea the truth is that most fiat currency has already long been virtual in nature i have no idea how long it has been since my hands have touched an actual us dollar or us coin i remember going to an atm when we started to think that the virus spreading in wuhan china might spread beyond i think its about a year and four month since i have touched paper fiatwhat difference would it make to the average us consumer with the exception of those reliant upon the cash economy whether their virtual savings are tracked the way they are now or on blockchain technology could be a big change for the bankingfinancial system but for the average joe or jane the change should be imperceptible yes the us dollar and all other reserve and my nonreserve currencies will go crypto as this will make all transactions taxable which is likely the ultimate goal across nations herei could be wrong i often am i do not see a happy ending for longterm or large investors in current independent cryptocurrencies as long as civilization stands on that note cryptos wont be worth anything should civilization fall either on that horrible day you will wish that you had stored clean water and canned food as well as gold and silver coinsare you sure about thisnews broke on monday that enterprise mobile and security software firm microstrategy inc mstr will sell  million of debt to institutional investors and use the proceeds to add to an existing long position in bitcoin that is believed to

question for a company that trades at a threefigure forward pricetoearnings pe ratio runs with a total debt balance that simply dwarfs its cash balance owns a negative levered free cash flow and a current ratio not just below  but below  are you sure about this actually the question might be for the buyers who will hold such debt securities just how much of a discount is necessary to make the

entertainment amc ceo adam aron has shown the way when gifted with higher market prices for corporate equity that is not supported by the fundamental realities of the business the man has recapitalized the balance sheet and funded corporate operations not only has aron taken advantage of this unexpected reality but he has even warned small investors that maybe they should stay away
