bitcoin’s taproot upgrade is basically a shoein as bitcoin stakeholders figure out the best way to bring it onlinedigital signatures are created from the private keys that control bitcoin wallets and are required to approve transactions taproot addresses will use schnorr signatures rather than bitcoin’s current signature algorithm the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm or ecdsa for shortin terms of data and processing schnorr signatures are smaller and faster than ecdsa signatures and also have the added benefit of being “linear” which means schnorrbased smart contracts can be optimized for functions that ecdsa signatures cannotthese differences have made taproot a highly anticipated upgrade because it will give bitcoin a boost to transaction privacy and allow for more lightweight and complex “smart contracts” an encoded contract with selfexecuting rulesthe tooling and coding improvements taproot brings will be largely under the hood and will be a boon to developers regular bitcoin users however will also benefit from usability performance and privacy improvements to multisignature multisig technology privacy software and even scaling tech like the lightning networkwithout taproot applying the following upgrades to these softwares would either not be possible or not be as viable boosting privacy and efficiency of multisig transactionsbitcoin development hub blockstream is developing a new multisig software  which will make multisig transactions more efficient cheaper and more privateunlike usual bitcoin wallets which only require a single signature from a private key multisig wallets require at least two or more signatures from different private keys to approve a transaction the idea is to distribute the risk of a wallet among multiple keys and if needed multiple partiesunder the current design with ecdsa contracts multisig transactions record the signature of each multisig participant individually schnorr signatures would allow each signature to be recorded as one signature on the blockchain making the transactions more lightweight in data and thus cheapersubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policy“ benefits multisig wallets such as blockstream green because using  is cheaper and more private than current multisig setups” blockstream researcher and applied cryptographer jonas nick told coindeskthe bitcoin upgrade will also raise the limit on signers a multisig wallet allows from  to a “much higher number” said bitcoin developer chris belcherschnorrsignature based transactions are more private because thanks to socalled scriptless scripts all taproot transactions have the same digital footprint that means a single signature transaction and a multisig transaction look the same on the blockchain under taproot’s rulesthis privacy improvement spills over into other areas of bitcoin’s development too“ also improves efficiency of multiparty contracts such as lightning channels coinswaps or discrete log contracts and improves the privacy of routing in the lightning network by enabling ‘scriptless scripts’ this also means that the anonymity set of regular transactions would become larger because for a blockchain observer it could just as well be part of a multiparty contract or multisig wallet” nick saidcoinswap disguising mixed coin transactionsall of the softwares nick referenced rely on multisig wallets to bind market participants in cryptographically reinforced rules of engagement called smart contractsone of these the privacy protocol coinswap is widely considered to be the best successor to coinjoin currently the most popular software for “mixing” bitcoins to obscure their transaction historyone shortcoming of coinswap’s precursors including coinjoin is such transactions show up as distinctly different from normal ones this makes it easier for blockchain analysis to pinpoint coinjoins onchain thwarting any privacy benefitsaccording to belcher bitcoin’s taproot upgrade will fix this problem“a good benefit of taproot is also that it allows scriptless scripts as you may know protocols like lightning network and coinswap depend on socalled hash time locked contracts currently these contracts are visible on the blockchain the thing that scriptless scripts allows is for those contracts to also look exactly the same as a taproot singlesig transaction”point time lock contracts making lightning more privateas belcher points out bitcoin’s lightning network uses hash time locked contracts htlcs to facilitate transactions but schnorr signatures would pave the way for point time lock contracts ptlcs an improvement on htlcs that allow for more private and efficient smart contracts for lightningthe privacy gain comes from a modification to how lightning network nodes “route” transactions lightning transactions must be sent directly and peertopeer on what are called “payment channels” otherwise lacking this direct connection payments must be routed through peers to which both the sender and receiver are connectedlightning network nodes route transactions by passing on a hash of the payment to each node on that payment’s path ptlcs alter this hash by adding random info at each hop to make the payment less traceable to any party conducting blockchain surveillanceadditionally ptlcs will enable more complex smart contract logic to facilitate unprecedented blockchain escrow conditions and to improve oracles since a blockchain can’t process data outside of its network an oracle feeds this data to it“technically  could be done today with ecdsa but it doesn’t have the same proven security and if it was implemented it would have to be redone once we get taproot” ben carman a developer at suredbits told coindeskother taproot improvementscarman and his colleagues at suredbits have been working on discrete log contracts dlcs a fairly new smart contract logic for bitcoin that while working today will be more flexible and easier to use when bitcoin’s taproot upgrade kicks inbelcher told coindesk that schnorr signatures will also enable “batched validation” wherein a bitcoin full node could “validate  taproot signatures in nearly the same time it takes to validate one  signature” this scaling solution would significantly speed the time it takes a node to verify all signatures in a blockadditionally taproot could use “ring signatures” to give users the ability to prove they own certain coins without having to reveal the public key associated with those coins“that means someone could prove that they own a certain coin without revealing which exact coin for example it would be possible to prove you own at least  btc or any amount by doing a ring signature over all the taproot  worth more than  btc and yet it doesn’t actually reveal which is yours” belcher said
