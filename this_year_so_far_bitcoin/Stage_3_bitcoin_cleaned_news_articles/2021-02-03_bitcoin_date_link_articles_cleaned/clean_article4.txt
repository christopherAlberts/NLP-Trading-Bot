bitcoin svs bsv scaling test network stn hit a new record last week the network processed over  transactions per second tps at one point on jan  beating its previous record of approximately  in december blockchain explained in plain english understanding how blockchain works and identifying myths about its powers are the first steps to developing blockchain technologies read morethe stn is a project by the bitcoin association which is operated by nchain and is aimed at enterprise scalability the project uses stn nodes in two ways for mining and listening around the globeit does this to match realworld operations as closely as possible to ensure that the transaction numbers seen are from a globally distributed networkthis stn is purely a testing network it allows anyone who wishes to build a solution to test it using bitcoin sv to see how the solution can scale or test it at levels expected to be seen on the mainnet in the futurethe mainnet is the production blockchain network that is used for projects to run on after they have completed testing on the test networkthe goal of the stn is to reflect the mainnet as closely as possible on a larger scale the mainnet already has this capacity but currently does not have the transaction volume demandthe recent beta and upcoming full release of bitcoin sv node software  have had a lot of development work to allow long chainslong chains  the most requested limit removal  have the greatest proof of work invested in them and generally mining nodes will always adopt a longer chain over a shorter onethe work done improving the software has in internal testing shown large improvements to the handling time of longchained transactionsbitcounscalingiostn operations manager brad kristensen told coingeek that his team thinks that over  is sustainable on the stn recently the team observed an average of around    over an eighthour periodstn statistics can be monitored by anyone at this site and the numbers achieved by the stn certainly do look impressivecurrently the btc bitcoin core network limits its block sizes to  which results in a maximum of seven transactions per second it can cost over  to send a single btc transaction of any amountthe stn is still early into testing version  with respect to chain lengths so expectations are still being formed but the work so far indicates that there are definitely raw performance improvementsthe current peak record was set with very few chained transactions in the blocks which formed the recordthe sustained tps record breaks were achieved with chain lengths between  and  which appears to show the longterm endurance of the network under load the next round of tests will start with chains of  increasing as the days roll onit does seem likely that this potential for transaction scalability will become very attractive for enterprises wishing to process large data throughput  without transaction bottlenecks and delaysif bitcoin sv can continue to offer micropayments for transactions and increase the length of chains then the sky certainly seems to be the limit for performance and scale  across the bsv mainnet
