safecryptocurrency is a highly speculative investment and while bitcoin is one of the more stable options it’s still much more volatile than equities and mutual funds“if you buy any type of cryptocurrency you need to be prepared to lose your shirt” says ari juels professor at cornell tech and codirector of the initiative for cryptocurrencies and contractsbuying from wellestablished reputable exchanges like coinbase gemini and robinhood is the safest bet but each has its own sets of rules and limitations says mike dudas founder of the cryptocurrency media and research site the block with robinhood you can only buy or sell bitcoins — you can’t transfer it to another person or use it to pay for items on websites that accept bitcoin cash app on the other hand lets you buy sell trade and spend bitcoins at your discretiononce you own bitcoins you can also hold onto it indefinitely in the bitcoin exchange you purchased it on which dudas says is what many beginners do — though that’s not the safest option bitcoin that sits just sits in a digital wallet could be vulnerable to cybertheft or lost if the exchange ever gets shut downone option is a selfcustody wallet where investors hold a private “key” or secret passcode that allows them to access their bitcoins securely but juels says this system requires vigilance and some technical knowhow and if you lose your key

digital wallet dudas says selfcustody can help here too whether that’s a hardware storage drive or an offline software program aka a “paper wallet” institutional investment companies like goldman

surge in ransomware a type of malicious software hackers use to block access to systems or data until a ransom is paid in this case the ransom requested is usually in bitcoins“the vast majority of bitcoin use is not criminal in nature” cornell’s juels says “but bitcoin has really fueled the rise of ransomware”is coinbase safecoinbase is the most widely used cryptocurrency exchange in the us
