last month  laguna beach resident benjamin levine logged into his blockfi account and noticed a sudden windfall of  btc worth over  million dollars at the time“obviously i was pretty wide eyed when i saw that” said levinehe and his wife were driving and he pulled over to the side of the road “it said that i received a bonus payment for april as part of a promotional payment” said levine “and it’s  bitcoin i remember saying to her ‘dang i just won a promotion’”subscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policydespite the extreme amount levine didn’t question his good fortune the deposit was clearly labeled as a promotion something he had checked multiple timeslevine’s bitcoin payment was in fact a costly mistake by the crypto lending company blockfi which is still trying to recover bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies it incorrectly deposited to users’ accounts as part of a botched round of promotional paymentsthe promotion was intended to incentivize users to trade in large volumes by rewarding them with the stablecoin gemini dollar gusd in some instances however the payouts were awarded in btc sometimes millions of dollars worth this mixup seems to have been an underlying factor in some though not all of the erroneous depositsthe drama that ensued illustrates a tension with centralized platforms one of the key innovations behind bitcoin is that transactions are not supposed to be reversible but centralized platforms like blockfi seem pretty willing to trycoindesk spoke with three different users who among the dozens who have since surfaced on social media and discussion boards were mistakenly given btc rewards they were able to successfully move some of the bitcoin off the blockfi platform but expressed confusion and frustration at the lack of communication from blockfi until days after the deposits and uncertainty about what might happen next in all three cases blockfi tried to recover the money after it was sentfallout from the blockfi promo erroron may  blockfi tweeted a brief statement stating there were issues with a march trading promotion and some participants might be awarded incorrect bonusesafter coindesk reported on may  that users were able to move some of those btc awards off the platform and therefore beyond blockfi’s control blockfi issued a statement on may  expanding on the issue it confirmed coindesk’s reporting tweeting that “a small edge case of approximately  clients were sic able to access the erroneous deposits and withdraw funds from the platform on may ”speaking at consensus blockfi ceo zac prince downplayed the issue“i don’t think it’s too big of a topic” he said “we processed the promo payout and there was a bug and an error made where we processed it in bitcoin instead of in dollars i think things got a bit confused online because there were some users who for an hour had  bitcoin show up in their blockfi account that was very quickly changed and corrected”prince added that a derivative of that bug allowed users to withdraw some of that btc“the net impact to blockfi’s was  clients that actually were impacted by this and less than  million usd in total value” he saidwhen coindesk emailed prince to discuss the error in more detail including how it could have happened he responded with a link to blockfi’s tweeted statementthe statements by blockfi show that it was not just its march promotion participants that were affected but a variety of promotions levine for example said he received a btc deposit on friday may  worth around  million at the time labeled as an april promotion coindesk reviewed documentation of the depositmultiple users were able to move bitcoin off the platform with some amounts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars blockfi meanwhile has called users who attempted to withdraw funds from the platform and sent legal threatsunintended consequenceslevine said he tried to offload the btc that same friday in order to use it to purchase a stake in a company he’d been contemplating a deal with for months he wanted to move quickly as crypto was experiencing a period of volatility in which his bitcoin bounty was declining in valueafter initiating multiple transactions he was able to move  btc off the platform before blockfi reversed the large deposit on monday levine said he did not hear anything from blockfi while he was sorting out details of the deal until sunday by which point he had signed a contractnow after repeated conversations with blockfi including a phone call in which levine alleges blockfi cofounder flori marquez threatened to get the fbi involved levine is in a tough position he’s responsible for the business deal he entered into because he took blockfi’s initial deposit at face value he could even face millions of dollars in potential liabilitywhen coindesk emailed prince to ask about marquez’s allegations he responded with a link to blockfi’s tweeted statementconflicting timestampsanother user who spoke with coindesk said they were in shock when they got their march promotional payout and thought they had won something the user who asked for anonymity for fear of reprisal said that “as any good crypto enthusiast would i transferred the funds immediately to my cold storage wallet”coindesk reviewed screenshots of these transactionsabout  minutes later the user noticed blockfi initiated a transaction reversal so the user assumed there was no way the withdrawal would still go through given how long withdrawals from blockfi generally take at this point there had still been no communication from blockfi about any errorsthen soon after that transaction reversal appeared on the site the user noticed the timestamp had been changed it now appeared as if the reversal had been issued at the same time as it landed in the user’s account not  minutes after the factthe user alleges the timestamp was changed to make it appear as if the reversal had been issued at the same time as it landed in the user’s account not  minutes laterthe user put in a withdrawal cancellation request but even so the withdrawal went through and the requested btc showed up in his cold storagethen came the carrotandstick emails threatening legal action while also offering compensation in gusd to return the fundslevine said he experienced a similar turn of events after receiving his deposit on friday may  he initiated about eight different transfers after receiving the initial email from blockfi threatening legal action on sunday he went back to look at his transaction history“they had gone to the transaction history and inserted a transaction reversal of negative  btc directly above where the deposit had originally shown up” said levine “so it’s very suspicious that could number one represent it as being the same exact time in the day and on the same date but they also superseded any of the following transfers in chronological order”when we asked prince to discuss these alleged timestamp alterations by email he responded again with a link to blockfi’s tweeted statementmore oversight requiredjoseph kelly ceo of unchained capital another crypto financial services company said it’s rare for companies like blockfi to see the kind of growth they have in the last few years without making some mistakes from a company building perspective he said it makes sense that maybe an error like this would happen nor are these kinds of issues uncommon in the traditional financial world in  citibank accidentally sent a hedge fund  million and struggled to retrieve the moneylevine is exploring his legal options ultimately he thinks centralized entities like blockfi must have more oversight“i am not in crypto to be a part of a centralized system and this situation made that clear to me” said the anonymous user echoing levine’s perspective “the fact i was able to withdraw this incorrect bonus is really concerning”
