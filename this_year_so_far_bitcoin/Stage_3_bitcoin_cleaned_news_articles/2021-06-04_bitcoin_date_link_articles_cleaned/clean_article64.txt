alternative mining algorithms reap higher profits than bitcoin mining in cryptocurrencies have jumped quite a bit in value over the course of the year and miners who verify transactions and earn digital assets have seen significant profits while bitcoin miners have been seeing daily profits rise a great number of other mineable digital currencies are pulling in much larger yields and ethash machines pull bigger profits than  mining devicesthe overall valuation of all cryptocurrencies in existence is around  trillion as digital asset values have risen considerably in  while a great number of blockchains leverage consensus algorithms like proofofstake pos there’s plenty of coins that can be mined with a machine like an applicationspecific integrated circuit asic mining rigmining rigs that can mine bitcoin btc using the  algorithm can bring in anywhere between  to  per day in profits that’s of course if the miner is using the latest hardware with at least  terahash per second ths of hashpowerboth microbt and bitmain produce the top btc mining rigs on the market today because they pull in the most profits using today’s btc mining difficulty and electricity costs — around  per kilowatthour kwh — the bitmain antminer  pro and the microbt whatsminer  get around  per day in profitswhile that’s good some mining rigs that mine other types of crypto assets make considerably larger profits in comparison one such example is decred dcr as a mining rig that processes the  algorithm can make between  to  per daythe top two decred mining devices include the strongu  and the microbt whatsminer  microbt’s machine pulls  watts off the wall and produces around  ths in hashpower statistics indicate that the strongu device also pulls  watts but produces about  thscoins that can be mined with the consensus algorithm ethash ubiq ethereum ethereum classic pirl and callisto show their mining rigs rake in significant profits as well for instance the innosilicon  pro eth miner gets around  megahash per second mhs and  a day in profitequihash and scryptfollowing yields from ethash the consensus algorithm equihash that mines coins like zcash zencash komodo and more also sees profitable returns the top mining rig that can dedicate hashrate to equihash consensus is bitmain’s antminer the antminer  gets around  per day with its maximum hashrate of  ksols solutions per second and power consumption of around  watts the secondbest unit is a step down from bitmain’s powerful equihash miner — innosilicon’s  zmaster it does around  ksols and only pulls in  per daystill the zmaster does better than a majority of  miners that mine btc even litecoin ltc miners will produce better profits by mining scrypt at the time of publication the innosilicon  ltcmaster and the lowerend  are the top two litecoin minersthe lowerend unit gets around  per day while the  gets  per day in profit owners of scrypt mining rigs don’t have to mine ltc either as they can also mine dogecoin doge gamecredits game and verge xvgbehind all the profits stemming from mining rigs that produce coins from algorithms like  ethash equihash and scrypt is  the  algorithm can mine bitcoin btc but also coins like bitcoin cash bch and bitcoinsv bsveven though profits are lower for  devices the number of  machines towers over the quantity of devices that mine alternative consensus algorithms there are far more products and manufacturers that produce bitcoin miners and the number of  machines surely eclipses all of the aforementioned mining rigs that leverage different mining rulesets combinedwhat do you think about the top mineable coins and the most profitable mining rigs in  let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section belowimage credits shutterstock pixabay wiki commons asicminervaluecomdisclaimer this article is for informational purposes only it is not a direct offer or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell or a recommendation or endorsement of any products services or companies bitcoincom does not provide investment tax legal or accounting advice neither the company nor the author is responsible directly or indirectly for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any content goods or services mentioned in this article
