bitcoinfocused developer group satoshiradiobr want to make the coins blockchain available as a free worldwide public service that works offline thanks to dedicated spacebased radio stationsas part of the development the team used the moon to transmit a bitcoin crypto btc transaction and added a message that reads elon we did it firstit was done to show that you dont have to be some eccentric billionaire to push the boundaries of the earth in search of freedom the team clarifiedwhat happened according to the projects website it aims to make bitcoin available offline because of the dictatorial control of governments bigtechs and internet surveillance that undermines basic constitutional principles and injures individual freedomswhile the developers admit that several successful attempts have already been made to send bitcoin transactions via radio what is new about what they are trying to do is that they want to make it achievable without costly or limited equipmentimagine that you are without an internet connection in an isolated region and without communication a small ht radio a cell phone or notebook with a bitcoin wallet and a few meters of copper wire to mount a dipole antenna is what you will need to trade your coins freely across the planet according to the websitesatoshi radio plans to use radio amateur radio satellites to listen to bitcoin transactions broadcasted this way and replicate them on the networkthe project also aims to organize many listeners and broadcasters around the world as contributors so that anyone in any part of the globe can send a transaction via radiothe service will be provided automatically and for free and will enhance the users anonymity by avoiding attributing an ip address to the transactionsalthough the internet can and is being controlled and censored it is not the only tool to be employed in sending bitcoin transactions and communications from one side of the globe to another on the planet the team explainsbitcoin sent to the moonin one experiment described by the group márcio gandra rafael silveira narcélio filho andré alvarenga and paulo jr transmitted a bitcoin transaction that requires approval by two wallets with the first signature applied to the moon to have the radio waves bounce back to earth where the second walletholder was able to receive and cosign it and send it to the blockchainrafael silveira and paulo jr were  away making direct transmission in a straight line impossible with the equipment used but totally possible if they had the lunar star as a mirror according to the reportthis experiment signaled the founding of the project and the audio files of the transmission will be minted as a nonfungible token nft to finance the acquisition of larger and more powerful equipment for the initiativethe next planned experiment will make use of amateur radio satellites to transmit a bitcoin transaction to be made through the lightning network scalability solutionlightning network is a network that runs on top of bitcoins blockchain and allows for instant and nearfree transactionsimage courtesy of satoshiradiobr
