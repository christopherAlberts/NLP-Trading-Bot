ups and downs involved in investing in bitcoin the  most traded tech stocks of  so far a quick visit to a few ai enabled smart cities from canada to amsterdam and the best internet reactions to the friends reunionlets start there were joined today by our coo linh dao smooke who i know has a lot to say on the subject of the friends reunion so lets hit pause on that and go straight to amy and hang who are also members of the hacker noon team with these two memes regarding joey tribbiani and james cordon respectivelyamy youre up first can you describe exactly what were seeing on this james cordon meme for our audio listenersamy  excellent so ill start by saying to you that i have not yet watched the friends reunion so i looked at this medium and i was like okay i feel like i understand a lot better now because it says im sorry if this isnt a brand new information but why in the fresh hell is james corden hosting part of the friends reunion hashtag friends reunionand it is a photo of rachel and phoebe and ross looking audaciousnatasha  perfect thank you for that now hi im will you go ahead and describe the second reaction to the friends reunion roasting nowhang  it was just like joey got the same haircut that he got  years ago and it was a comparison to like what girl reacts to haircuts and guy react to their haircuts is i can tell it my barber cut my hair like this like one millimeter shorterthen i said i will be very upset about that because i love my hair like i am obsessed with my hair but i feel like he always just doesnt give a shitamy  he really does look the same too like nothing has changedlinh  how can he do that he does not eat maybehang  no i feel like he is but i feel like he did a lot of aging from season one to season  already he was true he looks so cute from the first two seasons and i feel like because he ate a lot of pizza i guess oh the fastfood just got in on him and my  im like yo you are no longer cutelinh  let me rephrase that i dont think he has an age but he certainly has kept the same page role and the same type of smile and just certainly everything about him you still can recognize thatamy  he does have an iconic lookhang  yeah i feel like he didnt have to act a lot in the sitcom i feel like they they live in they are in character so its just like how they act in friends is how they are in real life i just feel like it i could tell if i made like jennifer aniston or and i can say hey rachel whats upyeah but he definitely looks the same at the time the years i know whynatasha   linh what is your full debrief of the friends reunion lets hear itlinh  my hot take is i dont hate it in fact i think if we just ignore the whole not mentioning of fat monica because its still problematic or the transphobic description of candlers dad its pretty decent its a reunion like to a friend and you still worse you feel nostalgic and then you feel like comfort it somewhatfriends resonates so much with a large group of people even to this day despite all of this problematic and i hate using the word depictions of things i think theres two reasons for ita large portion of the friends audience i see people whose language is not whose first language is not english and for example myself i dont im not the native english speaker friends is actually like the gateway for a lot of these people to understand english and learn english and understand american cultureso a lot of i would say snooty like comedy appreciating people is typically in the us would like look at these friends admirers and be like yeah why would you like such a show so my hot take is it actually better to understand friends from like an international perspective and how like a bunch of beautiful people in bed too many who speak perfect english and who have great chemistry resonate with international peopleand how as the culture like moving forward we can kinda empathize with that now i dont love friends anymore because i think ive become whitewashed to coming to america whole and like appreciating new kinds of comedies that i think over the weekend im still going to try to write my love letter and my appreciation for this show because it was so influential in my life as a  elite team and as someone who tried to learn englishamy  so how long have you been in the u s forlinh  ive been back and forth but i was  when i came hereamy  and are you watching friends when it came outlinh  no i was watching as i tried to learn english yeah yeahamy  pretty late like when you started come when you started to come to the stateslinh  yeahokayamy  yeah never thought about it like that in terms of so i grew up in coover im canadian born and raised and so this is ive definitely been raised in the north american culture to begin with ive never thought about it like that and from an international perspective of having an attachment to it because you learn english from my and i know that a lot of people do learn english from the show but i didnt i guess i never thought about how much of an emotional impact that would have as wellso i think thats really coollinh  yeah a couple of that with the growing pain of the  something like unable to date or dating too much and like just like relationship issues and how  like comedy wise improve like the whole laughing track and what have you thats if you like take that away and just look into the romancei think it does a decent job so a lot of  somethings resonate with them that waynatasha  i know we could and wed happy to discuss this all day but we must move on to the next segment of planet incident i believe linh is planning to write a story about friends slash love letter so be on the lookout for that but lets move on to the stories of the week read anything good on hacker noon amyamy  yes i read this story about an ai enabled city its about smart cities and how to get it right i thought that was super interesting because it talks about this canadian pride jet called keyside i didnt know about this before but it got yeah canceled quote unquote due to covidyeah this author really thinks that i had other issues before the project got counseled to covid the project itself its called keyside and it was supposed to be an ai enabled city for torontos industrial waterfront they are essentially saying that keyside failed to build public trust so that was one of the key aspects of building an ai enabled cityand if you dont get that public trust you wont have a successful ai naval city is essentially what this author is saying so thank you to evelyn who is our hacker noon contributornatasha   nice yeah this story actually prompted me to look at how amsterdam is using ai in the city and classic amsterdam they have a handy website called the algorithm register which describes exactly how theyre doing that and four of the interesting ways are automated parking control which it makes sensebut then also the one wanna know of misa social distancing control and monitors and a can confirm we have been told to get out of the city center by adjourn when it becomes too crowded so that was pretty intense they also monitor issues around the city literal garbage being put in the wrong placeand interestingly monitoring illegal holiday housing rentals because youre only allowed to airbnb or sublet your place here for a maximum of city nights per year per for a maximum of four people at a time which is quite a sort of effective way to combat i dont know i guess the decay of communities thats tourist towns really suffer from when nobody there is a permanent residentlets move on to the  most traded tech stocks of   showy hung do you want to tell us a little bit about the storyhang  okay so basically talk about what are the most ten trade is stock in  so far because its just like five months into i dont know how he categorized the more traded maybe like the most people who bought it or whatever but if its just list out  most popular tech stocks in the tech category and first we have apple who doesnt know apple if you are new into the stock market i feel like you should buy apple at some point in your life because i dont see apple going away anytime soon my apple and every time equal down to  i just bought it and that also reinvesttesla is a an interesting case because i dunno i dunno if i should tell people should you buy a tesla because i do adore elon musk but i hate him i dont like him but sure if you ever look at i have the opportunity of go into silicon valley and my roommate were like fast stop obsessedso we technically visited all the tech campus you can think of and i saw and hed be going to facebook campus and after we got before he got kicked out i saw a whole lot of tesla just chuckling over there and oh my god they look spectacular like im like if i become like if tomorrow raise my salary by five i would definitely put some of my money into teslaand then we have intel we have a couple more like intel and insight enterprise they are okay i dont let intel because i bought it but it keeps going down to the point im like whatever i would just see if i can break even and i sell it awaywe have microsoft number six which is i love that stuff like i bought my first office i bought my in  for my  birthday and it just go up i dont care how people travel i love iti dont know a photo i dont know much about it but if you are interested in like chinese and hong kong stuff i will say like alibaba or  cent is a better is a way better choice for youalphabet is okay typical basic at and t okay i dont care a lot i know limarc like atnt because it paid dividends so they are pretty good dividends stock like if you care about dividend at all so that is you buy a bunch of stuff and youve got the dividend by quarter okay i dont care much about dividends and i care all about growthso for me this list is good i have like more than two stock from this list so i would definitely recommend you give this list ago and is it enough to understand because if you go into like overly technical financial analyst analyst website like second apa like you would those up after five minutes reading that i like to work in i dont know what strict so i would really recommend the article for like always gives you a like new into stuffand you want to know like what tech stock to buy without having to like if youre like a passive investor definitely gives that article agoamy  literally my only comment is that i would also start investing laying if you five x my salarylinh  ill sit on itnatasha  nice everyone that was to wrap up the  best tech stocks the most traded in  forecasts apple microsoft tesla intel and alphabet coming out top according to hack a noon you heard it first so read it there speaking of startups any startup funding or acquisition news in your area recently amyamy  oh my goshyes okay so i was just reading this article on the daily hive which was written by an author his name is sam chan and its a very vancouver based publication which is really exciting so this article is very vancouver focused which i love it he talks about the grizzlies and he talks about all of the different like vancouver tech startupsand then he specifically talks about dapper labs which is a vancouver based company you might have heard of them they are the company behind the nba top shot and they are also the company behind crypto kitty is super exciting that its vancouver based they made the headlines again this week thoughbecause michael jordan just invested in their company and he is joined by other nba players i dont know them but theyre there wheres david when we need him the resident hacker noon basketball aspirinnatasha   language probably have something to say about that but also on the subjects of investments lang had been talking this week about a story regarding the ups and downs of investing in bitcoinlinh  absolutely its from one of my favorite hacker noon writers norm levenson and we went into details on what happened with the bear and the bull markets back in  up until now we see a lot of crypto boom and then we see the latest sudden kind of dip and then it went into details about how theyre like types of people that just want to get into crypto is to get rich specifically to get into crypto to get richand he does not think that all that its a smart idea you can scroll down to the summary the tldr at the endamy  wait people invest to not get rich is that not the pointlinh  the thing about crypto is that everything is very unpredictable both the blooms and the dips okay so unless you are extremely lucky and get there at the exact right time chances sometimes you will its just like the coin toss so the whole kind of pieces is surround if you want to invest in crypto if you want to invest in bitcoin go for itbut dont expect to at least instantly get bids okay youll get disappointed bitcoin and definitely brought blockchain as you have to stay but you should invest in it for the long term and for the technological kind of advancement it will bring to the society so i basically agree with it we do have certain thats an interest in certain cryptobut i dont think it should go this podcast when i do learn some the experience though is its like throwing shit on the wall like you never know like you can do all the right thing and then you just become a day trader and you cant really have time to do anything else just toss all your expectations speculation aside pos all of the whatever experts advice aside and just like investment for the longterm resultsyeah and youll feel a lot this sense of peace and the sense of yeah i have a little bit of like skin in the game and ill trust thathang  yeah i want to add my  cents on this one is i like crypto is not a livestock or unlike any other currency as you dont really have anything to base it on like if you leave it as a stock you can base the price and whether they buy or not buy arent the industry and the financial report and like the product and like howhow much it can grow in the future or if you want to buy if you go into go global you want to buy some foreign currency you can i go i deny that you still buy like a venezuela i dont know what is the currency the currency of venezuela but its not like a currency that you can like basically con the current economysituation that a country on crypto bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general its very unstable and i feel like  or like almost whoever by eco i dont even know what is that for so my if you go into invest it you shouldnt like in anything like stock currency or crypto bitcoin even like fiat money you shouldnt expect to get rich like over the night and just dont put all your suffering into a portfolio from i feel like you still buy crypto when you want to diversify to assess and do you think youre interesting like my case utsav told me to buy it i buy itnatasha  can confirm i think we can disclose by the way right that we are one of the increasing number of companies that are offering employees the opportunity to accept part of their salary in bitcoinlinh  that is correct we do have about  or  i believe total kind of holding money in cryptos mostly bitcoinand we offered up for anyone who wants to be paid instantaneouslynatasha  and i think thats pretty cool so staying with startup news the startup that i concept thinking about this week is called gorillas they are an undermine grocery delivery startup they raised a  million back in march and some pasta  billion valuation the reason why i cant stop thinking about them is because i live in amsterdam as i mentioned and these guys wont stop embarrassing me with their incredible ability to speed cycle on a like these old bikes sometimes evenand they just speed ride past me as a nonnative cyclist and its embarrassing but they also do deliver groceries in under  minutes and their growth has been explosive im seeing more and more of them on the roads and i just think thats really an interesting indicator of the needs of our generation that we dont necessarily like to go outside too much when and when not necessaryand we prioritize convenience even if it costs your own  cents extra or whatever the delivery fee is so yeah i thought that was a really interesting startup lang do you have any responses to that you had some colorado startups on your mind this weeklinh  yeah so this month in particular ive been approached by at least two or three lawyers about the prospect of moving some of their practices to go rural colorado which i thought was interestingand then theres this news coming out coming out of this week of two western slope startups that actually exiting successfully to public companies one of them i do know in fact is this montrose which is a rural place in western colorado startup con nomad reservations the founder patriotsand she was actually in the same cohort as when you got the  investments from dcf way to colorado sensitive so yeah i think the gist of the article its just kinda explain why rural colorado startups start looking more appealing to investors i think that a lot of it has got to do with honestly people moving to the outdoors to like places with less density and people meskers just like branch outside of silicon valleyand that side of like private i dont know new york other the huts of the world prefilled it and so i thought its very interesting that hacker noon and startup started in san francisco and now based in rural colorado could totally work with a team of  people all over the world all over the countryand so its like theres remote operation i thought that good signal this trend to investors and to lawyers like all these like practices surrounding startups that there is more to the startup world than like a couple of hubs and yeah watch out new york watch out silicon valleynatasha  awesome and what about you hang hows the startup scene looking in detroithang  yeah i felt like a lot like a couple of startups like id been watching for a long time but i dont know they were made in detroitand im not going to be a resident of the city of detroit anytime soon but i know theres a company called autobook is about the accounting and finance software which is super lame compared to other startups weve been talking about but likelinh  why am i not surprised that youre notnatasha  you just mean unsexyhang  but yeah so like you work in accounting and finance if i staff you know things can get shitty real quick especially like when you work for a high growing startuplike how i can recall how many times i had to categorize everything on quick book its just a pain it just slip a label focus its super manual and i think linh shared the same pain with meamy  yeah this is definitely the least sexy startupnatasha  we respect your commitmentsamy  the business analyst comes in i love itnatasha  lets check out what would
