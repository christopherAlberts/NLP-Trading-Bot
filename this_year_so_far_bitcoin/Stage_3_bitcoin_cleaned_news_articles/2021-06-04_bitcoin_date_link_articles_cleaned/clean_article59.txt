technology that underpins them – blockchain – is having its moment but experts say blockchain is still a long way from reaching its potential as perhaps the underlying technology of the  century bitcoin was touted as the future of money but what is the future of blockchain technology beyond it credit bloomberg blockchain is a digital ledger containing information which can not be altered once it is recorded in that ledger this is achieved by adding to the information a tag called a hash which is generated by making a computer solve an extremely difficult computational problem the process is called “proof of work” and is both the great strength and one of the major criticisms of blockchain technology this digital tag is now permanently associated with that “block” of information and it permanently links it in sequence to all the other blocks of information in the chain any computer can recognise and verify the information because of the blockchain in which it sits while bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen huge surges in value in recent months there has been volatility leading to fears the sector is another tech bubble in the makingadvertisementthe market in fake indigenous artwork in australia is estimated at  million annually on top of that many actual indigenous artists are at risk of exploitation having their work bought up and resold at markedup prices without any of it flowing back to them and their communities brisbanebased entrepreneur and quandamooka man adam robinson said he had been worried about the issue of counterfeit indigenous artwork before he realised he could use emerging blockchain technology to help secure it indigiledger founder adam robinson right with artist richard bell in his studio creditqut he set up his company indigiledger to use the cuttingedge blockchain to help secure the trade of authentic artwork “we created a business rules engine – how can an indigenous person create a piece of art and describe that as traceable and authentic” robinson said the company records a piece of indigenous art in an online ledger which forms the basis of its blockchain that is then encoded into a “digital fingerprint” which can be attached to the artwork and scanned by anyone seeking more information about itadvertisement“on scanning and looking at the indigenous product or artifact using that oneoff id the consumer is able to engage with that chain of traceability” robinson said “so they know that what they’re getting is  per cent authentic” because it is linked to a blockchain the information encoded on the id can not be altered once it is entered and it is extremely hard to fake since launching in late  robinson said the company has secured “tens of thousands” of pieces of indigenous artwork which have travelled around the world “our north compass is to work with indigenous businesses because a lot of the other sectors are being looked after already by other blockchain providers” he said “that’s what we’re really enjoying we’re dealing with one of the harder sectors to bring on board with this so if we can get this right then there’s a universal nature to what we do we can spread our wings further” because the technology is still so relatively new even people who claim to understand how blockchain works can struggle to explain it to othersadvertisement“i attended one of the biggest blockchain meetups in the world in manhattan two years ago” griffith university ict expert professor vallipuram muthukkumarasamy said “in the opening statement the organiser said the previous year  they had  people show up and two of them could explain what blockchain was “this year they said we hope it will be four” they had  people show up and two of them could explain what blockchain was this year they said we hope it will be four every individual bitcoin that exists in the digital world has been “mined” using computers and a hash added to them whenever someone trades a bitcoin everyone involved in the transaction can see the hash and verify that it is a real bitcoin this is what prevents someone mocking up a digital wallet with  million “bitcoins” inside beyond bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies experts have long seen potential in blockchain technology for things such as securing supply chains providing secure data transfers without the use of passwords and verifying the provenance of items such artwork as it is being used by indigiledgeradvertisementcrucially there is no central bank regulating the flow of bitcoins and no central arbiter deciding what data passes through a system the verification comes from all the nodes in a given network agreeing that the data they can see is the same across every node dr david hylandwood a multidisciplinary engineer and blockchain entrepreneur said at its core a blockchain system creates trust where usually there is none “the thing about blockchains is when you strip away all the stuff about ‘nonfungible tokens’ and cryptocurrencies and what have you fundamentally they’re trust engines” he said “they can prove that the nodes that operate the blockchain all agree with something their records are immutable meaning they can’t be overridden it’s not like a traditional database where you can rewrite history – you can’t do that on a blockchain the whole thing would stop working” there has been a big boom in interest in blockchain systems over the past few years and  saw interest climb from sectors which had not been thought of as needing blockchain lachlan feeney is the founder and chief executive of brisbane blockchain consulting company labrys which has moved to capture the market of existing companies wanting to explore what blockchain can enhance about their businessadvertisement
