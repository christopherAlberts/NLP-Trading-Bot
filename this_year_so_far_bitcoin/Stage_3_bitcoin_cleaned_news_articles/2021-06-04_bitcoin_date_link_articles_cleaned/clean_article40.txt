the westlake tex brokerage is taking a hyperpragmatic outwardlooking approach and the malvern pa giant is relying on its inner compass vision of realityjune   —  am by brooke southall comment scharles schwab  co and vanguard group recently clarified their divergent stances on selling and holding bitcoin as investments  and they remain polar opposites of fidelity but also far apart from each otherthe  indexing fund giant is really having none of it while chucks  brokerdealer revealed its cue to get in the gamecraig iskowitz schwab is at the barest minimumfidelity with  trillion of aua meanwhile has no qualms and continues to blaze ahead see fidelity investments applies its proven peter jubber to its unproven bitcoin unit and its launch of fidelity digital funds signals its all in on blockchain currencyin contrast the westlake tex and malvern pa giants largely remain holdouts in selling holding and administering bitcoin as investment assets based on recently published statements by eachthe difference is that schwab describes unequivocally how it will go allin if it goes in at allschwab promises to provide both crypto custody and crypto spot trading buttressed by fullon education to make it user friendly it writes clients can access bitcoin exposure at schwab through third party managers like grayscale schwab is at the barest minimum says craig iskowitz a consultant who also sits on the advisory board of blockchange which connects managers of models with crypto to financial advisors fidelity is way beyond that with bitcoin mining and a whole ecosystemcrypto keyschwab is willing to abide by a demanddeservessupply logic if the market comes to maturity schwab is also open about what might herald a mature crypto markettim welsh its not like taxis and uber you can be a fast follower herewe believe that future sec approval of a cryptocurrency etf will be a key step in the market’s development and an attractive lowcost option for clients interested in this space the company states in a research memojust dont expect schwab to be the asset manager doing the applying for the etf says new yorkbased consultant greg ogaraif schwab submits a crypto etf application in the shortterm it might be perceived as an endorsement for an asset class with too many unknownsschwab is also specific about what it considers an attractive offeryou can expect schwab to have more investment options for clients including spot crypto trading and custody its report saysand of course if we do bring new solutions to market like always you can expect them to be a great value designed to support client need and surrounded by the advice and education our clients have come to expect from us and deserveschwabs advance on cryptospecificity likely reflects in part what it is hearing from the  rias who hold  trillion at schwab says tim welsh president of nexus strategy in larkspur califi spoke with an ria last week and they said i get at least three bitcoin inquiries each week the custodians have got to do somethingfast followerschwab is still in control of its cryptocurrency destiny welsh assuresits not like taxis and uber you can be a fast follower here he says schwab could probably replicate  in   minutes if they havent written the code alreadyfidelity is flying close to the ground with its crypto suite of services says ogarai think they are positioning themselves for crypto without directly jumping into an overt endorsement of direct retail trading and broad access  which is smart he sys although you cannot trade bitcoin directly in a fidelity brokerage account coinbase digital currency accounts balances can be viewed on the fidelity platformyet david lindenbaum a  schwab executive responsible for all aspects of product development and management who recently left and advises blockchange doesnt believe schwab has the bandwidth to move that fastright now they have their hands full with the td integration so it will be a few years before they enter the space he saysas cryptocurrency becomes more widely regulated and adopted in the us i foresee schwab entering the space via an existing crypto custodian or making an acquisitionvanguard remains unflinchingly convinced the emperors of bitcoin are wearing no clothesthere is no enduring economic or investment rationale to expect cryptocurrencies to generate positive real returns vanguard americas chief economist roger aliagadíaz wrote in a vanguard website post titled the case for caution with cryptocurrenciescounterintuitively vanguards doubtful stance is a positive sign for the entrepreneurs jumping into the category without external validation iskowitz saysthere are true believers people on the fence and naysayers says the ezra group principal its only disruptive if someone is against itassessing valuea schwab center for financial research faq uses strong language to nay say bitcoins viability as an investmentfidelity ceo abby johnson is leading the charge into cryptobitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are speculative investments it notes in the cryptocurrency faqbitcoin doesn’t fit within traditional asset allocation models as it is neither a traditional commodity such as gold nor a traditional currency bitcoin’s dramatic volatility is driven primarily by supply and demand not inherent valuetraditional value metrics don’t apply so there are no methods for assessing its value that we endorse or find persuasive beyond the trading value schwab writes as a caveatyet the schwab faq acknowledges that larger forces than logic book learning and reason are in play with cryptocurrency see charles schwab  co is a budding cryptocurrency convert and will enter the market in a big disruptive way says its ceobut not before the sec says it barks or quacksnevertheless in the  years since the underpinnings of bitcoin were first described the cryptocurrency market has developed beyond an initial experimental phase and continued to mature as a new unique and sizable asset classopportunity costsvanguard rejects cryptocurrencys decadeplus history alone as a reason to even consider abandoning proven stores of value because the opportunity cost is just too highfor investors adding exposure to cryptocurrencies would mean reducing allocations to traditional asset classes such as stocks bonds and cash which vanguard views as the building blocks of a prudent wellbalanced investment programlooking at their core investors vanguard doesnt need it in the short run iskowitz says but personally i see nothing but upside in having the ric edelman  to  exposurefidelity speaksasked for its own corporate statement on digital currencies fidelity reminded by email that its actions  a large multiyear push into bitcoin  speak for themselves see fidelity bags  billion aum digital assets win to its custody as federal regulators attempt to move bitcoin custody from weirdo websites to mainstream banksa spokeswoman also sent a link to a march article in the wall street journal where fidelity expressed its view on the matter“the digital assets ecosystem has grown significantly in recent years creating an even more robust marketplace for investors and accelerating demand among institutions” a fidelity spokeswoman wrote in the wsj addressing its sec application to launch a bitcoin etf see why fidelitys bitcoin etf application might have a shotin other words fidelity is simply meeting a rising demand from investors for access to digital assets
