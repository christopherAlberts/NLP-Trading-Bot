typically when you hear about cryptocurrency company raising money they do so through venture capital and private funding or through an initial coin offering ico which is when a company raises funds specifically to create a new token but now ripple the company behind the token xrp cryptoxrp the native token on the xrp ledger is seeking to buck the trend and eventually go public through an initial public offering ipowhile the company has not filed a registration statement or anything ripples ceo brad garlinghouse has said several times that the company could look to go public a somewhat unique play in the cryptocurrency space lets take a look at what it might mean for the xrp tokenwhat is xrp and why is it differentxrp is currently the fifth largest cryptocurrency with a roughly  billion market capsimilar to bitcoin cryptobtc and other cryptocurrencies its a peertopeer network mainly seen as a way to conduct more efficient payments globally but there are actually several big differences that set xrp apart from cryptocurrencies like bitcoinwhile bitcoin uses blockchain technology the xrp ledger uses a different kind of consensus ledger technology to validate transactions on the network this can all get pretty complex but both methods are distributed ledger technologies and both methods rely on nodes on the network which are devices like computers that host the network and are interconnected to agree on and verify transactions with bitcoin and its blockchain miners verify transactions but on the xrp ledger a much smaller group of nodes verify transactions and these nodes are actually preselected by ripple this in essence makes bitcoin more truly decentralized because there is no one party behind it or managing it ripple is a private company managing certain aspects of the networkanother major difference is that the xrp ledger doesnt rely on mining to create new tokens like bitcoin and ethereum which could be seen as a positive right now as cryptocurrencies have come under fire for how much energy is used in the mining process ripple premined its xrp tokens  billion of them and then releases new tokens periodicallythe concern behind that is if ripple suddenly releases a ton of tokens all at once it could severely impact the supply and demand bitcoin on the other hand has a fixed supply of  million tokenswhile bitcoin was created more as an alternative for individuals to pay for things with the xrp ledger is more efficient at clearing and settling payments because it is faster and cheaper than bitcoin and most other crypto networks thats why it has seen more interest from financial institutions with more than  known banks having partnered with ripple labs the xrp ledger can process  transactions per second compared to bitcoins maximum of seven transactions per secondjourney to ipogarlinghouse has been talking about a potential ipo for ripple for a while now and has also said he thinks there will be a lot more crypto ipos in the future which we have seen with companies like silvergate capital nyse si and coinbase nasdaq coin although not specifically with companies that have developed cryptocurrencies as far as i knowbut ripple has been involved in a lawsuit with the securities and exchange commission sec that has slowed the process the lawsuit alleges that ripple and its two cofounders illegally raised over  billion in an unregistered ongoing digital asset securities offering the sec claims that ripple raised this money starting in  through the sale of xrp tokens and allegedly gave out billions of xrp tokens in exchange for marketmaking and other noncash servicesrecently yoshitaka kitao ceo of japanese company sbi group which is ripples largest shareholder said on a recent earnings call that once the sec lawsuit clears ripple plans to go public after the current lawsuit ripple will go public the current ceo wants to do that chris wants to do that he said according to cointelegraphhow would an ipo effect the price of rippleafter the news in late april that ripple planned to go public following the sec lawsuit the price of xrp tokens jumped  so the move clearly stirred interestbut theres also a chance that if people have another way to invest in ripple one that is more based on traditional earnings they might flock to that instead of buying the actual currency its hard to say right now given that this would be a potential test for other cryptocurrencies interested in going publicbut my guess is that the ipo will improve the visibility of ripple and the xrp token to the broader market traditional ipos can be very difficult for retail investors to take advantage of so perhaps they will see the xrp tokens as a way to invest cheaper and before the ipo i also think the price of xrp tokens will still depend on its realworld utility and how well it can help institutions like banks improve their moneytransferring capabilities if they gain traction and disrupt the payments system like many believe it can then i am sure more people will want to hold both the companys stock as well as the xrp tokenscorrection the original version of this article called the xrp token ripple when in fact ripple is the company that created the xrp ledger the xrp token is the native token on the xrp ledger were sorry for the error
