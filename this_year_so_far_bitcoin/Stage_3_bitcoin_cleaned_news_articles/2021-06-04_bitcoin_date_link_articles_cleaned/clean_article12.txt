zug switzerland june   prnewswire  bitcoin association the switzerlandbased global industry organisation that works to advance business with the bsv blockchain and digital currency has confirmed that the bitcoin sv bsv blockchain surpassed btc in accumulated data size demonstrating the ability of the bitcoin network to scale without limitson may   the accumulated growth in data size of the bsv blockchain surpassed the btc blockchain for the first time with the total data stored onchain reaching  gb on the bsv network compared to  gb on the btc network on that date since then bsv continues to extend its lead as the largest and most datarich blockchain increasing the amount of data stored onchain to  gb compared to  gb on btc as of june   reported data from coindancethe continued data growth of the bsv blockchain can be attributed to its decision to follow bitcoin creators satoshi nakamotos vision to scale unbounded with no limit on the default block cap size and thus the transaction volume and data capacity on the bsv blockchain as a result the bsv network offers high transaction throughput having already sustained over  transactions per second on its mainnet and expected to demonstrate  transaction per second throughput later this year at extremely low cost the median transaction fee on the bsv network in  was less than  of a us centin contrast the btc network imposes a default block cap size of only  mb with block weight up to  mb limiting its network to  transactions per second onchain  requiring higher transaction fees and restricting the utility of its network to highvalue and store of value transactions for many years btc supporters have argued that the bitcoin network cannot or should not scale but their position has been proven wrong by the bsv networks greater data capacityon march   the bsv network processed a world record  mb block  mined by taal distributed information technologies comprised of  transactions including several large mixed media files that block broke the previous world record for biggest block size – which also occurred on the bsv network – from may   when a  mb block  also mined by taal containing  million individual transactions demonstrating the diverse data capabilities and use cases the bsv blockchain can supporttransactions on the bsv blockchain originate from the array of businesses leveraging the diverse functionalities offered by the bsv network – including simple payments tokens social and digital media content online game activity and timestamping records – in addition to the business consumer and public sector data managed through the chaincommenting on todays announcement bitcoin association founding president jimmy nguyen saidwe recognise that bsv overtaking btc in accumulated blockchain growth is an interesting milestone but its really just one step in the journey to something bigger btc proponents have long argued that bitcoin cannot scale and that its network must be restricted to a tiny  mb block cap but with  mb block ranges already demonstrated superior data functionalities shown and now a larger total blockchain data size too bsv continues to prove that bitcoin does scale every day bsv businesses and developers are showing just what the bitcoin network is capable of when its allowed to scale with its blockchain being used to power use cases as diverse as onchain social media esports and game activity supply chain management ar and vr virtual items  vaccine tracing for the african country of lesotho and in the nottoodistant future the egovernment services for an entire nation of tuvalu its all part of a new datadriven digital economy made possible by the bsv blockchain handling greater data capacity as satoshi nakamoto envisioned and were just getting startedto learn more about bsv and how its blockchain ignites the power of data for business applications and services watch coingeek zurich – a free threeday virtual event

blockchain and uptake of the bsv digital currencythe association works to build a regulationfriendly ecosystem that fosters lawful conduct while facilitating innovation using all aspects of bitcoin technology more than a digital currency and blockchain bitcoin is also a network protocol just like internet protocol it is the foundational rule set for an entire data network the association
