as tens of thousands of crypto enthusiasts head to florida for the bitcoin miami conference this weekend an ebullient mood from the sundrenched partygoers will permeate at least some of the commentary around bitcoin but the reality is that all is not perfect in cryptoland at least in markets which seem moribund – and irked by a guy named elonwhile all that goes on we at coindesk continue to process the impact of our actionpacked consensus  conference last week one part of that figuring out how to keep engaging the incredible community that has formed around our desk rewards token which is the subject of this week’s column the creativity of this spontaneous group has gotten me thinking more broadly about the role that communities play in any system of moneyspeaking of communities those of the decentralized finance ecosystem are innovating as frantically as ever to talk about new developments in decentralized layer  defi protocols and the challenge regulators face in figuring out how to address this complex new system sheila warren and i were joined on our weekly “money reimagined” podcast by rebecca rettig general counsel of aave and marc boiron general counsel at decentralized exchange dydxhave a listen after you read the newsletteryou cant create money without piranhasat coindesk’s annual consensus conference last week we experimented with a new rewards token that was so well received it offered powerful insights into the relationship between community and moneywe gave ticket holders an initial issuance of  desk tokens and provided them with opportunities to earn more as they viewed sessions and participated in other features of the virtual event then we offered them a variety of nonfungible tokens nft some redeemable for swag and experiences others sold as rights to digital trading cards based on coindesk reports of famous moments in crypto historyyou’re reading money reimagined a weekly look at the technological economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system subscribe to get the full newsletter herethe results way exceeded our expectations by the end of the conference there were  registered desk holders who among them had made more than  claims and purchased about  nftssubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policybut more important than the raw numbers was the way in which people engaged with the concept they stuck around and participated in the sessions bantering with each other both about desk and the live video content they were watching in the process they organically formed a lively desk communityin a matter of days the fledgling community had spun up its own discord channel while more than  signed up for a coindeskadministered desk telegram channel these “desk piranhas” – as they call themselves – are building creative ideas around the tokenthere are communitygenerated memes including one with a mock movie trailer about plans for an nft of the “black hoodie guy” seated behind ftx ceo sam bankmanfried during one of his consensus interviews there are people planning desk meetups during this week’s bitcoin miami conference and next week there’s a shared netflix party viewing of the horrorcomedy movie “piranhas”all this has given us an opportunity to turn the desk experiment into a full coindesk product for that there are better minds than mine thinking of ways we incorporate desk into the wider website watch this spacebut in the meantime we can look with wonder at how this community emerged and ponder what it says about all the other community phenomena around digital currencies tokens “meme investing” and money generallymoney  communityour desk experience was a reminder that money has always been about community there’s a feedback loop between people’s desire to own and use a currency and the way in which it intermediates human interaction regardless of how functionally advanced your currency is as a technology this community function is a major determinant of its valuebefore i get into the obvious comparisons with the social media tribes that drive up the value of altcoins such as dogecoin and xrp let’s recognize these ideas apply to governmentissued fiat currencies toothe global system of exchange that has developed around the dollar is constantly being reinforced by people’s collective obsession with the us currency think of all the movies art songs and cultural meme references to “greenbacks” “benjamin franklins” “bucks” “fivers” “pennies nickels dimes and quarters” that burnish its image as a quasimagical object of desirethis is where joseph nye’s concept of “soft power” intersects with currency the international cultural community around the dollar is just one way the us exerts power – its armed forces matter are another – but it’s a vital part of its global dominancelet’s face it technologically the dollar is outdated the inefficient us banking and payments system still uses paper checks for crying out loud it integrates none of the cuttingedge monetary policy and governance features that comes with cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance yet it rules the world thanks largely to the selfreinforcing power of a “dollar community”now for the first time that community is looking a little less united as concerns rise about the political and economic sustainability of a dollarcentric global financial system and as technologies spanning crypto data services trading and social media foster new approaches to payments and other financial services people are exploring alternatives it’s why everything around money suddenly seems unmoored as a baffling array of new finance acronyms and memes leaves many in the mainstream confused nfts spacs stonks defiamong the many alternative projects the winners will be those who find that same lightninginabottle formula that draws and builds a dedicated community of believers you need to see something like coindesk’s little twoweekold desk experience sustained for a much longer period across a much larger group of people lit must be stressed that desk is merely a rewards token not a currency although it’s an  token – currently built on the rinkeby ethereum testnet – issuance and redemption is centrally determined and managed by coindesk it can only be redeemed for coindesk productseven so the lessons gleaned from this new community’s behavior are translatable to other more truly decentralized cryptocurrenciesour experience speaks to why dogecoin gains so much attention for example despite its monetary inferiority to bitcoin and the comparatively small size of its developer base a similarly fun interactive concept of community has emerged among the world’s doge followers albeit on a grander scalethere’s also a lesson here for bitcoin as well as for ethereum the advanced technical aspects and large networks of these leading cryptocurrencies are vital to their longterm viability but all that technical and developer firepower would be worth naught if there weren’t also two large passionate communities of people obsessed with themconsider the giant bitcoin miami conference tens of thousands of people are descending on miami this weekend because they want to be part of a vibrant community also read the “conversation” below for a look at how emotional members of that community can get when their beliefs are challengedthis is the messy human part of crypto memes jokes emotions and subjective sometimes irrational beliefs seem antithetical to the serious mathbased work of protocol development but in some respects they are just as important for success whether it’s hardcore bitcoiners’ aspirations for “digital gold” status dogecoiners’ putting their shiba inuthemed coin’s sights on the “moon” or a media outlet figuring out how best to employ its new corporate rewards token to optimize audience engagementcommunity mattersoff the charts btc price and hashratewith the price of bitcoin down almost  from its midapril alltime high and with the bitcoin mining industry facing both environmental demands and the threat of a ban from china it’s a good time to look at the relationship between the btc price and the total bitcoin hashratefirst a sixmonth chartshuai haocoindesk source coin metricsbased on a sevenday moving average the bitcoin network’s total hashing power has shrunk somewhat from a record high rate near  million terahashes per second in midmay more notable are the signs of a somewhat closer but still imperfect correlation between price and hashrate during the two phases of market selloff in april and may as well as during the shortlived interim price rebound in late aprilearly may the price pulled back harder than the hashrate during those selloffs while the latter rose further than the former during the rebound nonetheless there’s some evidence here that the more bearish price environment is affecting miners’ resource decisions as the profitability equation shiftsit’s too early to say whether the net decline in hashrate is a broadbased consolidation or a temporary blip to deal with margin squeezes for a small subset of miners perhaps it just reflects a small few who are now “redecommissioning” the old inefficient machines they’d previously recommissioned when margins were wide during the bull runto put what’s happening in perspective let’s look at the longterm interaction between these two measuresshuai haocoindesk source coin metricsthe chart shows that while a  rise in price has been clearly accompanied by an expansion in hashrate as miners have consistently added more and faster capacity to tap dollarbased profits shortterm changes in hashrate have for the most part been independent of shortterm price changesthe hashrate began rising sharply from early  even though it took more than another year before the bitcoin price properly emerged from its  slump to start posting huge gains and as the price kept rising the hashrate had some big swings up and down even as the overall trend was skyward that variability likely reflects nonprice factors such as the weatherrelated ebb and flow of electricity generation from china’s hydro dams as well as the periodic introduction of new more powerful chips and mining equipment at different timesthe one glaring exception to this independence was the pricecorrelated decline in mining capacity in late  as a final leg down in btc forced miners to shut down inefficient expensive machines to protect margins that capitulation seemed to confirm the reality of a longerterm slump in the overall crypto economy the question is whether the latest signs of pricehashrate correlation foreshadow a similar movement into a bearish phase if so the good news for btc hodlers is that same history suggests they really won’t have to wait long for both the price and the hashrate to resume their upward climbthe conversation is bitcoin my true love or notthis week’s journey into crypto twitter angst gets a more personal lens than usualinviting trouble perhaps i’ve decided to analyze some of the negative responses to last week’s column in which i wrote of the prospect of a new “crypto winter” due to a newly negative mainstream narrative around bitcoin’s environmental impacti argued that bitcoin miners and leaders should work proactively to shift perceptions engaging with energy companies and government officials to develop policies that reduce bitcoin mining’s carbon footprint while turning it into a dynamic financing source for green energy infrastructurein doing so i managed to upset bitcoiners and environmentalists alike the response from the former was the most striking it confirmed a point made in this week’s column that the bitcoin community is founded on emotional connections as much as rational thoughthere’s my original postone classic antibitcoin take was inevitable – that it “wastes” energynote “wastes energy” is an entirely subjective claim it depends on whether you believe society gains something with censorshipresistant decentralized money and whether you think bitcoin’s energyconsumptive proofofwork consensus algorithm is needed to achieve that my answer yes and yes my only caveat is that we must strive for  renewable energy usage in that processfrom the bitcoin side my critics were stirred up by podcaster and rt anchor max keiserthis prompted a bunch of accusations that coindesk and i were spreading fud fear uncertainty and doubtpartly i think that’s because calling out a bear market tends to anger people whose fortunes are tied up in bitcoin but more important some hardcore believers treat any suggestion that bitcoin has a problem and by extension any suggestion on how to address that problem – even one as nonspecific as mine involving no inkling of a protocol change – as a de facto attack on its decentralized “perfection”my suggestion that miners work with government officials to promote green infrastructure may have challenged a purist view that the cryptocurrency will on its own accord change the world for the better just by existing to me that’s a naive blindfaith view that’s dangerously similar to the rigid beliefs of religious fanaticseither way i’m still unclear how all this makes me a bitcoin “hater” but that’s what one of my more frequent critics sought to prove in a series of tweetsa couple of days later triggered by a throwaway joke from messari founder ryan selkis my critic was back to repost a graphic that supposedly captures where selkis and my ilk – including intriguingly federal reserve bank of st louis analyst david andolfatto – standnote the crime we are accused of we don’t truly love bitcoin i feel like i missed a new commandment that our lord satoshi delivered to his disciples before departing “love bitcoin as i have loved you”seriously do we need any more evidence that bitcoin is founded as much on the quasireligious adoration of believers as it is on cryptography before you get
