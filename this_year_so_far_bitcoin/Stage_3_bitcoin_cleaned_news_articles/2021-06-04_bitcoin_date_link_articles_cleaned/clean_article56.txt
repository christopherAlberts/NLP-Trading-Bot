cryptoasset business it said on its website you should know who you are dealing with and whether a cryptoasset is suitable especially considering the risk of such products for example when entering a business relationship you may want to consider whether the business is based in the uk or if it is registered with usglen goodman an investor and author of the book the crypto trader said im not surprised so many are reluctant to invest in crypto as its not protected by the fscsif you invest in the stock market and the trading platform goes bust  taking your money with it  youre eligible for up to £ compensation if the same happens with a crypto platform you may lose everythinghowever fscs protection does not cover investors if their investments lose money or those companies go bust only if the platform doesand this is only the case if an investment platform or provider is regulated by the fca or the bank of englands prudential regulation authority and as a result the fscs it is important to check the fscss website as well as that of your investment provider to ensure you are coveredbarton added the stat that stood out was that  per cent of those in their thirties are waiting

to engage with crypto so that we can help to demystify the space and build their trustit is unsurprising that a perceived lack of regulation around cryptocurrencies unsettles some peoplecurrently only four cryptocurrency exchanges are fully registered with the fcadozens more including wellknown names such as etoro and revolut have been placed on a temporary permissions register introduced at the end of last yearthis was due to expire next month but on thursday morning was extended until march  to give exchanges more time to work with the regulatorcoinbase is not listed on the fca exchange as it provides crypto services to uk customers from an irelandbased entity called coinbase europeit will soon register with the central bank of ireland due to it launching a similar registration regime to the fcahughes added if the industry is to gain the trust of the broader public it is essential that further regulation is implemented consistently across the boardgoodman added the sensible thing to do is buy crypto through a platform and then transfer it into your own private virtual wallet for protection the problem is thats a fiddly process and people sometimes lose their passwords and their cryptocurrencyit would be much easier if the fca extended their protective umbrella to crypto investors so they could invest using intuitive platforms and apps with the peace of mind the fscs
