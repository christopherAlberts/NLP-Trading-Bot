representations of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin dash ethereum ripple and litecoin image reutersflorence loillustration“what’s the best bet to turn rs  lakh into rs  lakhs in  days” my phone buzzes with a whatsapp message one evening on may  journalists get lots of questions that flummox them this is one of themthis question asked on a whatsapp group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts does not elicit any direct response one member shot off a chart capturing the recent rollercoaster ride of bitcoin prices but that chart fails miserably in explaining how to multiply one’s investment by five times in one monthi have spent the last few weeks inside some of india’s cryptocurrency whatsapp groups i was allowed into six such groups one group member thought i’m working undercover to weed out cyber crime these groups are constantly thrumming with messages reflecting its astonishing popularity among individual investors the constant pings give me phantom vibration syndrome—the feeling that my phone is ringing even when it is notbut these few weeks have been rewarding not financially the day i invested in bitcoin happened to be the day it started a fall that hasn’t ended yet but it helped me get a good peek into the crypto world and the people who are driving its investing frenzyi wish i could sum up the experience neatly in one paragraph but the wildly swinging nature of crypto prices is mirrored in the wildly disparate conversations in these groupssome people are investing rs  lakh and losing big time to scams others are propagating complex mathematical models to predict future prices almost all of them are just in for the ride and everyone sounds like an expertno one says bitcoin they say btc no one says hold they say hodl misspelled slang an inside joke everyone has ‘proof’ or ‘evidence’ they summon price charts—never mind some of them from years ago—to vindicate their thesisthe one thing they don’t have a handle on regulation what the indian government eventually will do about regulating cryptocurrencies triggers questions and causes some consternation but the hazy state of rules has not dimmed anyone’s enthusiasm for cryptomeet the adminsabhishek chauhan  stands at six feet and two inches his ambitions soar above his height chauhan is the administrator of moonshot plan b for bitcoin trades a twomonthold group of crypto investors who look to him and his school friend john kennedy yes it’s his actual name for investing advice it is an ambitious gamble because not even founders of crypto exchanges or founders of actual cryptocurrencies have quite been able to predict the wild ride that currencies have undertaken recentlythe price of one bitcoin the most used cryptocurrency rose from  in september  to a record  last month imagine the price of a company’s share or gold or anything rising that fast that quickly you couldnt and then it fell nearly  barely in a week to hit  last weekall bets are officially off on ‘crypto talks’ another group a person predicts it will hit at least  before recovering again who knowschauhan’s instructions are a variation of buy sell and ‘hodl’ with time and price limits for individual currencies he passes these messages in the organised and efficient way of stock market analystshe plans to monetise this in the future charging a monthly fee from users to access better research sources and help his investors early signs are good his group touched whatsapp’s  limit and he has started a second group for newer members“i’m not here for the money i never came here for the money i’m here for the thrill said chauhan an engineer who works with tata consultancy servicesi’m quite happy this price correction is happening it is needed after the rally”being in only for the thrills is alright because thrills are guaranteed making money isn’tchauhan has been investing since  when as a student he borrowed money from his parents to invest he saw an investment of rs  in bitcoin rise to rs  he didn’t sell in  when the first major crash following a similar rally happened he saw it fall to rs  he was and is mostly unperturbed by the price movementsanatomy of a scamnot everyone can recount a similar experience another investor is lamenting his misfortune the man who says he is in virtually every crypto group there exists in india and who claims to know the finest crypto lawyers and entrepreneurs has lost about rs  lakh prices have risen after he lost the money in what he calls a scam he requested anonymity as he is currently embroiled in legal discussions to get his money backthis is the whatsapp message he sent me edited for brevity“in  i met  guys in a crypto investment event they were very knowledgeable about bitcoin new coins and have an investment firm they impressed me with their knowledge of trading showed high profits on their mobile etc and i believed them they promised a return of  per month on my investment so i transferred  bitcoin note everyone can’t afford one whole bitcoin you can buy tiny fractions of a currency hoping its value will increase to his wallet as an investment without doing any paperwork that was a mistake but thankfully he returned my principal and interestand indeed after  months they paid  principal and  giving me  interest  bitcoins and  interest added i got  bitcoini was extremely happy to have received  monthly interest without doing any paperworkdeal was closed here few months passed by  they both invited me to their new spacious office in a prime location where rent is rs  per month they asked for investment again this time i was very greedy for easy money so i transferred  btc from my wallet to his wallet this happened in march and now they deny and say you invested that as partner now we are at loss we cant pay you ☹️ … the price of  bitcoin reached   he made tremendous profit with my funds i have proof that i transferred bitcoin from my wallet to his it is reflected in my wallet statement”it is a sobering tale and one i heard from five others who have all fallen to scams by different people but with the same modus operandi start a crypto project raise money show a little progress and disappear because crypto is decentralised not regulated and an investment can be traced back to an id but not a person disappearing is particularly easy“there are so many scam projects out in the market see what stage the project is in what are they raising money for check the founder’s background carefully” says monark modi founder and ceo of crypto exchange bitexthe administrator of another group is the founder of a coin one that trended on twitter a few weeks ago but he did not want to be named because of the regulatory uncertainty this admin as they are known started the group in  and has along with his friends and group mates made a lot of money in recent yearsin the groups he is in he has seen people pitch many ponzi schemes the most common one is where one person invites a few people to invest in a project brings more people in promises commission for adding people and keeps passing the buck admins of these groups keep removing such bad actorsto be sure the cases of people getting conned on these groups are few and far between many find it useful admins of these groups often get messages thanking them for their advice and besides the thrill of making money these people enjoy the community experience of watching your fortunes rise and fall togethergroup activitymany of them are busy investing sending predictions to assuage others sending memes the one mainstay of every whatsapp group and contradicting their own statementsone member reminds others to avoid all the noise and just continue investing in a flash he also sends a dozen tweets from crypto experts and forwards every bit of crypto news he gets verified or not he creates the noise he wants to avoideveryone is worried about regulation some are concerned about the lack of options if they lose money to a ponzi scam because there is no redressal mechanism another has unkind words for the the reserve bank of india whose discomfort with crypto is well known saying it a “short sighted vision” another person immediately attempts to correct him saying they have “no vision at all” and yet none of this has stopped any of them from investing and in fact doubling down when prices have fallensome of these groups work through the night there are messages at  am and at  am i can’t remember the last time i unlocked my phone and there wasn’t a new message from a crypto groupinvestors in and outside of these groups have invested thousands lakhs and in one case tens of lakhs of rupees individually in the last six months irrespective of the regulatory uncertainty group members and admins often warn that investors must do their own research and that the people giving advice are not responsible for the fate of the investmentbitcoin and ether the best known coins are also the most preferred coins in these groups because they are used for real world projects and considered legitimate  some people promote newer coins or other obscure projects they find but these have fewer takers given the scamming potential described abovegroup members are also divided over dogecoin shiba inu coin and other meme tokens whose prices have risen and fallen spectacularly for no real reason except hype and the internet’s warped sense of humour people are quick to term them ‘shit coins’ and insist that anybody who loses money on these meaningless coins deserves itone person holding this view however privately confessed that he has invested in dogecoin “i’m okay to lose it its a few thousand bucks if i make money though it will be hilarious seems like a good chance to take” he told meif crypto prices hold up whatsapp activity will continue admins of groups from  say that half their members have joined in the past six months and in  when crypto prices fell and rbi enforced a ban not only did the chats stop they thought they would have to delete the group fearing a regulatory crackdownmost of these investors seem aware of the risks involved only that some realise it too late“in today’s world everyone will give you advice but you need to make your own calls it is your money and your risk said arjun vijay cofounder of crypto exchange giottus“investing in crypto is like a lottery it comes with very high volatility doing proper research before investment reduces downside and increases the chances of upsideif crypto investing is like lottery or gambling these whatsapp groups are the las vegas of bitcoin or dogecoin trading just that what happens in these groups does not stay in these groups
