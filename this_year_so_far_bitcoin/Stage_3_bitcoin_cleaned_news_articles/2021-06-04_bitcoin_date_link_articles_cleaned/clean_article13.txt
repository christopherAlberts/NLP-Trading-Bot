in midapril nearly  local environmentalists marched to the gates of greenidge generation a bitcoin mining facility in upstate new york in a lastditch effort to block its expansiontheir objection that the creation of the cryptocurrency an energyintensive process in which computers compete to solve mathematical puzzles may harm efforts to limit global warmingthree days later the planning board in the small town of torrey voted  to allow greenidge generation to more than double the number of machines it has mining bitcoin“everything we want to do to fight climate change could be erased” yvonne taylor one of the march’s leaders told the thomson reuters foundationthe showdown in new york – where a private equity firm turned a mothballed coal power plant into one fired by natural gas that provides electricity to mine bitcoin onsite – is part of an increasingly fraught debate over the social benefits and environmental costs of the world’s most popular cryptocurrencybitcoin consumes almost the same amount of electricity annually as egypt did in  according to an index compiled by the university of cambridgeon wednesday elon musk the chief executive of tesla inc said his company would no longer accept bitcoin for car purchases citing environmental concerns in a swift reversal of its position on the currency after criticism by some investors“as the price rises bitcoin could consume as much energy as all the data centers in the world combined” said alex de vries founder of research platform digiconomist which publishes estimates of bitcoin’s climate impact“at least other data centers are providing us with cloud computing used by billions every day hardly anybody is using bitcoin” he addedgreenidge spokesman michael mckeon said in an emailed statement the firm was doing all it could to address environmental concerns“natural gas is a bridge to the future and it’s an important part of the energy mix for new york state” he said “we are committed to further investing in ways to enhance our green profile and are looking at various options right now”‘let’s make it green’cryptocurrency boosters say their profits do not have to be at odds with environmental protection“you can be a bitcoiner and be an environmentalist just like you can be an environmentalist and get on flights and use a washing machine” said nic carter a partner at castle island ventures which invests in cryptocurrency projectswhat really matters is how much of the energy cryptocurrency mining consumes comes from renewable sources he saidin april a nonprofit coalition launched the crypto climate accord a global industrybacked initiative urging cryptocurrency enterprises to switch to using renewable energy“we want to help the crypto industry decarbonize” explained jesse morris chief commercial officer of the energy web foundation one of the groups that put together the accordthe idea is to get the industry to netzero carbon emissions – offsetting any emissions it cannot cut itself – by energy web for example plans to roll out a technology tool that will allow cryptocurrency miners to prove they are using sustainable energy an innovation mr morris said would help link investors with green crypto firms“this industry isn’t going anywhere so let’s make it green” he addedbut given bitcoin’s hunger for energy – and how much money can be made mining it – there is a concern it could eat up more than its fair share of renewables pushing other activities to use carbonintensive power said ketan joshi a renewable energy industry analyst“a lot of success in reducing emissions could get canceled out by the demand from bitcoin” he predictedglobal problem local solutionsas they guzzle electricity bitcoin operations generate a substantial amount of carbon dioxide the industry’s planetwarming emissions reached more than  million metric tons per year in  according to a study in scientific journal joulewhile most cryptocurrency mining takes place in china major operations have opened up in a number of north american cities where some officials are alarmed by the industry’s emissionsin  plattsburgh new york imposed a moratorium on cryptocurrency mining after it became the city’s top power consumerand earlier this month lawmakers introduced a proposal to suspend cryptocurrency mining operations for three years throughout new york state as it carries out a review of the industry’s environmental impactofficials also recently took steps to limit that impact in missoula county montana where operations take advantage of cheap electricity from a local hydropower plant“at a certain point this industry was using about a third of all of the county’s electricity” said diana maneta the county’s sustainability officerin  missoula county used emergency zoning powers to require new cryptocurrency mining operations to offset their energy consumption such as by agreeing to purchase renewable power directly from new solar and wind projects or developing their own clean electricity productionthe new zoning restrictions were made permanent this february making missoula the first united states county to regulate cryptocurrency mining from a climate perspective mr maneta saidaggressive companies influence local governmentswith the price of bitcoin rising over fivefold in the past year alone mining operations are increasingly attractive for investors despite the environmental pushbackthe greenidge mining facility in new york announced in march it would this year become the first bitcoin mining firm with its own power plant to go public on the us stock exchangecommunities with cryptocurrency mining in their backyard increasingly find themselves in david and goliathstyle clashes said ms taylor the activist who opposes the greenidge expansion“small local governments are being approached by very aggressive companies and sadly they become enamored with the money and pressured” she saidmr mckeon the greenidge spokesman said the recent planning board vote showed the company had genuine local support“the local community sees the value of the jobs we have created the taxes we have paid and the impacts we have had on the local economy” he said adding the facility also contributes power to the local gridms taylor’s cause has recently been taken up by national environmental organizationsin april legal campaign earthjustice and green group sierra club wrote a letter to the new york state department of environmental conservation opposing the expansion of the greenidge facility partially on climate groundsmandy deroche an attorney with earthjustice said the nonprofit had identified at least  other former fossil fuel plants in new york that could potentially be turned into data centers that power cryptocurrency minestwo are already being converted – one that will draw power from the grid and the other set to run partly on solarget the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox your email address by
