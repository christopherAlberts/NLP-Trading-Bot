day jobs in order to work on aquagoat fulltimeat its core aquagoat operates as a deflationary automated liquiditylocking and selfstaking direct distribution protocol every transaction using aquagoat incurs a  fee  of all transactions is sent to liquidity while the other  is directly redistributed to all holders as transactions are made over time the amount of tokens in the burn wallet which acts as a holder increases leading to an inflating burn rate with more network activity consequently the circulating supply and holder redistribution decreases over time incentivizing early buyers and longtime holders in contrast to conventional cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ethereum aquagoat runs on the binance chain which operates on a proofofstake system where transactions are confirmed through a liquidity pool as opposed to the energyintensive proofofwork system where transactions are verified through miningcurrently aquagoat’s donation wallet also acts as a holder and receives a portion of the  redistribution in order to maximize automated charity allocation with each transaction the token will be creating their own swaps farms staking and lottery planned for release in late july additionally the aquagoat software development team will begin rolling out applications beginning in june and have access to various apis for internal bot and software developments some of these developments have already been implemented in the community discord and telegramaquagoat recognizes how harmful man made pollution can affect the world’s oceans ecosystems and marine life that inhabit
