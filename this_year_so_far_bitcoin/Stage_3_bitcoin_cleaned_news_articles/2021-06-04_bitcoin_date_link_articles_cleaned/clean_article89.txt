i heard recently that in gta  some missions will reward you in bitcoin instead of cash for completing some missionsthe stock market feature will return with the addition of a broker for different cryptocurrencies if gta  incorporates this right its huge for crypto — tom henderson tomhenderson june  but despite we’re still some two years away from the moment rockstar would take the wraps off gta vi someone with a good track of gaming snoops has shared a tidbit that’s totally unexpectedtom henderson who’s known for his battlefield leaks says grand theft auto  would no longer use cash for ingame payments but… bitcoin that’s right the next version of gta would give up on cash and instead use cryptocurrency possibly in an attempt to align the game with the modern world“some missions will reward you in bitcoin instead of cash for completing some missions the stock market feature will return with the addition of a broken for different cryptocurrencies” he sayscertainly this is big news for everybody not just rockstar especially because using crypto in gta  could obviously represent a massive boost for this continuously growing marketbut on the other hand henderson explains that rockstar is unlikely to call the crypto it wants to use in gta  “bitcoin” but possibly invent a new currency that will be exclusive to the game“i’m not joking this is what i heard from someone that i trust it will likely not be called bitcoin but it will be a cryptocurrency” he saidbut of course everything should still be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism especially because we’re still pretty far from the moment gta vi would finally see the daylighta leak that reached the web recently suggested rockstar could use live events in gta online to drop more hints about gta vi especially after the enhanced version of the game lands in the fall of the year
