most of the subjects we tackle here in know your options are about equity options the bulk of zacks’ research is in equities so i assume that most of our readers who trade options are looking to speculate on a stock protect a position in a stock or make income from selling options on a stocklately though there’s been a lot of interest in trading futures and options on cryptocurrencies like bitcoin so i’m going to do a multipart series on the trading instruments and venues available to tradersi’ll start with a quick primer on how someone might speculate or hedge with exchangelisted commodity optionstrading futures and futures options can seem intimidating but the basic concepts aren’t really all that different from equity options you’ll just need to familiarize yourself with some small mechanical differencesif you have an opinion on the direction of commodity prices you’ll find liquid futures and options available on the cme group’s cme globex trading platform in the late ’s the cme pioneered the development of futures contracts that had a financial instrument as the underlying rather than a physical commodity you can trade futures and options on bonds interest rates stock indices and even the weatherthose product offerings now include futures and options on bitcoin they offer a “fullsize” bitcoin contract for which the underlying is  bitcoin and a “micro” contract for  bitcoin both are quoted in terms of the price one coin because of the opportunity for traders to make lowrisk arbitrage profits if the prices were to diverge you’ll find that the prices on the two contracts are almost always identicaloptions are only available on the fullsize contractsfuturesfirst you’ll need to be able to trade futures in your brokerage account this process is different at each brokerage house but almost all the popular online brokerages now offer futures tradingstory continuesnext you’ll need to understand the contract specifications in the case of bitcoin each contract is for  bitcoin and the prices are quoted percoin so if you were to buy one bitcoin futures contract for a price of  you now own  coins for a total notional value of  if the price increases to  and you sell your profit would be  net of commissions and feesthe important thing to remember is that these are big contracts when the price of bitcoin moves  you make or lose  at  and moving  or more during nearly every trading session the pl will pile up fastnote with commodity options you’re generally going to want to close a futures position prior to expiration though there are colorful anecdotes about a trader who neglects to close a position and has  bushels of corn deposited on his front lawn and it’s good comedy it’s not true physical delivery occurs at railway junctions or ports and if you accidentally take delivery it’s not going on your lawn but you will pay steep fees to resell the physical productin the case of bitcoin this is less of an issue because the final settlement happens in cash you could simply let contracts expire and the clearing house will post a credit or debit in us dollars to your accountyou may still observe extreme price volatility in the expiring contracts as they are about to expire so it’s still a good idea to either close a position or “roll” it forward to another contract month before expirationoptionscme’s options contracts settle to futures contracts that means that if you own a call option that expires in the money you are now long a futures contract at the strike price in the same example as above if you purchased a call with a strike of if the price of a bitcoin was  when the call expired you’d buy one futures contract for  which you could either liquidate for a total profit of   per coin times  coins or which you could continue to holdbitcoin options are europeanstyle so they can only be exercisedassigned at expirationif you didn’t want the futures contract you could simply sell the option in the open market prior to expiration if it’s in the money there’s a good chance it will be trading for very close to its intrinsic value on the final day of tradingall the terminology regarding bidask spreads multileg spread trading and the general mechanics of the market are the same as equity options just as with stock options cleared by the options clearing corporation the cme clearing corp acts as the counterparty to all transactions guaranteeing the trades by requiring margin deposits there is no counterparty riskcmeyour most important resource is going to be the cme’s website it’s full of information about contract specs and the mechanics of trading and expiration – including especially dates and timestrading futures and options on futures doesn’t need to be confusing if you’re aware of the differences between having futures as the underlying instead of shares of stock and the different contract specifications it’s really not any more complicated than trading options on individual
