new york lawmakers have submitted a bill banning cryptocurrency mining operations for three yearsintroduced on monday bill  seeks to put a moratorium on the operation of cryptocurrency mining centers unless they undergo a full environmental impact statement review the review would have to prove that a mining center doesnt affect the stateâ€™s greenhouse gas emission targetscryptocurrency mining centers are an expanding industry in the state of new york often but not exclusively located in retired or converted fossil fuel power stations including dormant power plants the bill saidas part of its climate leadership and community protection act the state has called for a  reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over  levels by  that rises to  and netzero emissions in all sectors of its economy by the cryptocurrency mining bill added the continued and expanded operation of cryptocurrency mining centers will greatly increase the amount of energy usage in the state of new york and it is reasonable to believe the associated greenhouse gas emissions will irreparably harm compliance with the climate leadership and community protection act in contravention of state lawthe bill applies to existing and proposed mining operations in addition to a cumulative impact assessment on greenhouse gas emissions it would also include a review of any impacts on water or air quality or wildlife reviews would include a  public comment periodbitcoin has had a considerable impact on energy consumption its consensus algorithm relies on a process called proof of work in which miners compete for the chance to include transactions in a block on the chain to do so they compete to solve a complex mathematical problem the bitcoin protocol seeks to regulate the production of blocks to one every  minutes to do that it must make the mathematical problem more difficult as more miners join the network adding more computing powerproof of work forces the total computational power on the network upward as bitcoin becomes more popular the cryptocurrency has seen its price soar recently forcing the hash rate uprelated resource it pro  understanding our complicated relationship with ai the  issue of it pro  looks at the very human problems associated with artificial intelligence download nowaccording to the bitcoin energy consumption index it takes  kwh of energy to process a single bitcoin transaction at the time of writing which equates to the energy required to run a single us household for  days the bitcoin network uses roughly the same amount of energy as the netherlands each yearwhile the core bitcoin developers seem committed to proof of work competing network ethereum which offers additional functionality is preparing to transition to an alternative proofofstake mechanism this approach replaces miners with validators chosen to mine each block dramatically reducing energy use compared to proof of work
