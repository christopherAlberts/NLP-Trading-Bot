bitcoin has broken above  as the crypto frenzy continues pantera capital ceo dan morehead joins yahoo finance live to discussvideo transcriptzack guzman welcome back to yahoo finance live in this weeks crypto corner were taking a look at all the major moves in the crypto space starting here with bitcoin and the way that thats been trading mostly sideways in that  range when you back up though and look at the historical price of bitcoin one commodity pricing model is catching a lot of eyes for how accurate its been in predicting where bitcoins price could go its called the stock to flow modeland it usually is applied to mine commodities like oil taking into account the rate at which youre adding to the supply aka flow which interestingly can be applied to bitcoin for the way that that is quote unquote mined and is also looked at as a commodity whose rate we know at which its being added to the ecosystem in terms of the block reward given to miners for confirming transactions we know that last year that reward dropped to  bitcoinand our next guest says when you crunch the numbers the model says that bitcoin could hit  per coin by august so lets bring him in pantera capital ceo dan morehead joins us right now and dan appreciate you coming on here to chat the forecast talk to me about stock to flow and where youre seeing it shaping up here and why youre so confident that that number is rightdan morehead yes so it is like commodities theres a certain amount of bitcoin that are created every  minutes a certain number are created in the beginning it was  bitcoins every  minutes and then every four years that number is cut in half so weve had three times in bitcoins history that that halving event has happened and each time it has a lesser impact because theres more stock outstanding but you can use that to imply what would happen in this current halvingstory continuesand then the first halving in  there were only  million bitcoins outstanding and we were taking  million out of the flow for the next  days thats the average peak and then the second halving in  obviously its half as many are being withdrawn from the system and there were then  million bitcoins outstanding so it was only about  of the stock of bitcoins that were reduced in supplythis time the halving again half as big an impact on the number of bitcoin and theres  million bitcoins outstanding when the halving happened last may so it has about onethird as big an impact using those ratios of the size of the halving relative to the price impact in the previous two we calculated the implied price for the end of this halving period which would be august of this yearand in our april investor letter a year and a bit ago we put a forecast out for the price of bitcoin over the next  months and april last year we predicted that bitcoin would hit  in the middle of april and it did exactly on time so when people say oh this is crazy you know i push back i dont think its crazy its ive been doing this for  years its actually very predictablezack guzman yeah its just wild to see how closely that matched up going back to your investor letter last year now a year later almost exactly to the day when we look at maybe the way that bitcoin now is playing into portfolios we talk a lot about it because its the biggest one but we are seeing some pretty impressive moves from the likes of other alt coins out there dogecoin catching a lot of attention but also ether in the way that its being utilized in the defi space talk to me about how important those things are now as you track the portfolio of your guys funds and the way that youre building out thosedan morehead yeah i think its really important back in the day bitcoin was everything there were no other cryptocurrencies and then you know for many years bitcoin really was a great proxy for the industry but there are dozens of really important projects now so from an investor standpoint we recommend that people have exposure to a basket of different blockchains bitcoin now represents about  of the total market cap as recently as four or five months ago it was so in the last three or four months bitcoin has been stable bitcoin is at the same price it was in late february but ethereum is double and other cryptocurrencies have done very well and for example our liquid token fund that trades all the tokens that are tradable its up  year to date when bitcoin itself is only up  so theres lots of opportunity outside of just bitcoinakiko fujita dan i want to get back to the formula you laid out the calculation here that the price rising  per new million users youve said that if you follow that formula bitcoin would essentially be fairly valued at  whats the caveat here what do you think could derail thatdan morehead you know i dont think there is its an amazing relationship where two data series the number of people using bitcoin and the price of bitcoin have gone up five orders of magnitude which is just a staggering amount and the ratio or the relationship between those have been utterly constant each data point with one exception has hit exactly on time and it does make some sense that the more people that use bitcoin the more valuable then that work is its just kind of econ  supply and demandand if you forecast that out it would say that bitcoin would hit  next year  that seems reasonable were on pace to do that and then the  number is taking the number of people that have a smartphone thats the only requirement for using bitcoin is the possession of a smartphone so with  and  billion people on earth at some point a decade from now when theyre all using cryptocurrencies that would imply a price of around  and that actually seems reasonable thats about  of global  i think bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be a very important version of currency in the future and being  of todays its definitely doablezack guzman yeah i mean when we look at doge i wonder how much that could be applied there just because the sheer size of the network and community there around the project as even though it started as a joke theres a lot of things i want to ask when it comes to that because i was also looking at correlation between dogecoin and bitcoin maybe not surprising to see it not as highly correlated as these other alt coins to the price of bitcoin given that it was created as a joke but when you look at it how important might that be when you think about diversification in the crypto space to finally have an alt coin that could be useful for something like thatdan morehead yeah so doge is a fun story to talk about because it was created as a joke and now its been around for a long time and it appreciates so its gained some credence as a store of value and an analog i would use this is theres a lot of modern art like marcell duchamps journal or jackson pollock dripping some paint on some canvas that you know might have started out kind of edgy kind of ironic and ended up worth hundreds of millions of dollars so doge could easily be like thatakiko fujita well see how much further it has to run dan morehead pantera capital ceo its good to talk to you today
