employees’ retirement system for seven years before joining emerald he’s held a variety of board positions his resume all points to a traditional longtime investor at a modestsized firmthen there’s his  million emerald banking and finance fundit’s the secondlargest public holder of grayscale ethereum trust which tracks the cryptocurrency that has soared to record highs this week it’s one of the biggest mutualfund owners of grayscale bitcoin trust as of march  it has  shares of the purpose bitcoin exchangetraded fund ticker btcc and  shares of the canadian bitcoin etf ticker ebit as you might expect this has paid off big the fund has surged  over the past year easily beating every other us domiciled openend mutual fund focused on financial stocks according to data compiled by bloomberg it’s almost double the return of the vanguard financials index fund which itself is up a remarkable  in the past  monthsriding the crypto wave more than just about any other mutual fund has come at a cost however morningstar inc published a scathing report that downgraded the fund’s cheapest share class to neutral from bronze stating in bold letters on the first page that “big changes diminish this strategy’s appeal the first sentence of the analysis says in no uncertain terms that “emerald banking  finance has moved outside its circle of competencehere’s morningstar analyst eric schultz on why the fund’s investment process is now deemed below averagecomanagers kenneth mertz and steven russell historically focused on us banks with market caps between  million and  billion using emerald’s  process to find the best names these steps include extensive interviews with management board members customers vendors and competitors the team also assesses competitive positioning and growth prospects then builds valuation models estimating future cash flows and earnings to arrive at a target price and evaluate downside riskthe recent shift into cryptocurrencies calls the discipline of the approach into question the managers often diversified their core regional bank holdings with an eclectic mix of other businesses such as reits financial technology insurance and even gold miners but these bets were at the margins and prudently sized cryptocurrencies have no cash flows or management teams to assess so with nearly  of portfolio assets directly betting on their price the move seems more speculative rather than a diversifying extension of the existing processit’s true you can’t sit down and interview a bitcoin you can’t size up ethereum’s management team it’s hard not to see emerald’s decision to load up on cryptocurrency etfs as something akin to a yolo bet you’d find on reddit the difference is it comes in a mutual fund that mertz has managed for  years not in the robinhood account of a mertz didn’t respond to bloomberg instant messages or an email to his bloomberg address “since this fund was founded it seeks growth in the financial service sector — and it hasn’t changed read a quote from mertz in the wall street journal morningstar’s report notes that russell is the one who tends to focus on banks “and recently cryptocurrencies the fund managers argue that investments in voyager digital and mike novogratz’s galaxy digital holdings are based on following them for years and wagering that they could move beyond crypto and into more traditional financial services they also say they were concerned about banks with large exposure to commercial real estate during the pandemic and now might feel more comfortable investing in them againi suppose that’s believable though just this week galaxy agreed to buy crypto custodian bitgo inc hardly a sign of a pivot into more typical banking either way it doesn’t seem as if it truly matters according to the fund’s prospectus “it will under normal conditions invest at least  of the value of its assets in stocks of companies principally engaged in the banking or financial services industries it considers voyager digital and galaxy digital “investment services according to a fact sheet while morningstar labels voyager a tech stock even after paring back some of its exposure to voyager which has gained a staggering  over the past year it remains far and away the largest holding in the fund emerald also holds some of the company’s shares in its growth fund and insights fundthe next several months should be telling given that emerald banking and finance fund is a mutual fund with a minimum  investment in its retail share class it seems unlikely to attract cryptocurious buyers to the same extent as cathie wood’s ark innovation etfs which have a much lower barrier to entry but given its massive gains do current investors lock in their profits and exit or ride this out a bit longer bitcoin for its part isn’t providing the boost to returns it once was with its price fluctuating while other options such as dogecoin soari’m not sure which way the flows will go but morningstar is spot on to warn that this fund isn’t quite what it claims to be perhaps it’s just a sign of the times that even longtenured investment managers can be drawn to cryptothis column does not necessarily
