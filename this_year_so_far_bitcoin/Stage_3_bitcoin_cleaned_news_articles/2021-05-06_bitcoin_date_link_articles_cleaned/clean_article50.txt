kitco news  as concerns rise about inflation one of the ongoing debates amongst investors is which financial asset would serve as the best longterm store of value michael saylor ceo of microstrategy argues that the dominant store of value in the  century must be digital and ideally this monetary asset takes the form of the bitcoin standardyou want to fix your country like nigeria or zimbabwe the way you fix your country is you buy  billion  billion worth of bitcoin and you issue currency back to buy the bitcoin that is the bitcoin standard and every one of your citizens stopped starving to death and they live a decent life saylor told michelle makori editorinchief of kitco newsstill skeptics remain bill maher host of the political talk show real time with bill maher has recently criticized bitcoin by saying there is something inherently not credible about creating hundreds of billions in virtual wealth with nothing ever actually being accomplished and no actual product made or service rendered its like tinker bells light its power source is based solely on enough children believing in itsaylor responded again its the most disruptive technology of our lifetime and so its the butt of jokes comedians will make fun of it i imagine that comedians probably made jokes about planes trains and automobiles in their timeon the so called greater fool theory that bitcoin skeptics prescribe to saylor said that skeptics dismiss the utility aspect of the financial asset in question is wrong because when the romans pumped water into a reservoir they didnt put it in the reservoir because they thought a greater fool would pay them more money for the water in the future they put it in the reservoir because they thought they might need water in the future when you actually store food in a refrigerator you dont put it in the refrigerator cause youre going to sell it to a greater fool in the future you put in the refrigerator because you think you might be hungry in the futureâ€¦ so he doesnt understand that this is really an essence storing energy for future use he saidon the argument that mining bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at large consumes too much energy and is therefore costly for the environment saylor said that this concern is overblown especially when put into perspective how much wasted energy comes from other aspects of our everyday lifethe truth of the matter is everything on earth uses more power than a small country bill maher uses  times our electricity that costs  times as much as the electricity used in the bitcoin network to enrich himself and hes not really thinking about it if you take all the energy used in the bitcoin network it amounts to  basis points of all the wasted energy so one quarter of  of the wasted energy in the world offers the hope of a decent life to  billion people and solves an economic problem saylor saidfor more details view the interview in the video above
