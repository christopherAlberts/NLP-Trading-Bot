bitcoin promotes a better society that depends upon personal responsibility more than anything elsea better society depends upon personal responsibility more than anything else without personal responsibility we cannot expect anything other than what weve already gotbitcoin is not a political manifesto and its certainly not a selfhelp book its a computer protocol designed to perform a specific function but bitcoin does offer commentary on our current situation because it did not emerge within a vacuum it emerged as a result of the global mess we currently find ourselves in if all was well in the world bitcoin likely wouldnt exist because it wouldnt need to instead bitcoin exists precisely because everything is not wellthe world faces serious problems because societies begin as constructs of the human mind albeit very complex ones the problems we face today are ultimately rooted in our thinking for those willing to look bitcoin points to a simple but inconvenient solution what matters most in the pursuit of a better world is personal responsibility everything else is secondaryhuman beings are social creatures weve organized ourselves in communities since time immemorial and its undeniable that we can achieve more when we cooperate rather than go at it alone the effects of solitary confinement prove beyond any doubt that we need other people around us to remain functional something as simple as friendship family and parenthood illustrates just how often and without a second thought we put the wellbeing of others first that being said if we cannot take responsibility for ourselves were the ones in need of helpif we extrapolate that idea from the microcosm of a family to the macrocosm of entire societies what sort of world can we expect when millions of government officials governing billions of people are unable to take responsibility for their own lives addiction depression schizophrenia and everything else that ordinary people struggle with are problems also faced but not easily acknowledged by even the most powerful people in many ways we live in a world where the blind are leading the blindi do not believe that bitcoin is the solution here the solution is personal responsibility bitcoin simply points in that direction just like a google maps listing for a mechanic isnt going to fix my broken car until i find the actual repair shop bitcoin solves a very specific problem it provides us with a better form of money im not trying to define bitcoin in absolute terms instead im simply pointing out that its simplicity is a good thing we shouldnt over complicate it and attribute to it things that arent directly connected to itbut it is useful to consider bitcoins commentary on society to see how it might change society as a result of what its proved pete rizzos recent article on the last days of satoshi illustrates just how unique bitcoin is in terms of its leaderless nature by highlighting the fact that its move toward leaderlessness happened organically rather than being preordained by its creator i struggle to think of any other complex structure thats as widely distributed as the bitcoin network and yet entirely voluntary in terms of its governance let alone a structure thats accrued over a trillion dollars in valuebitcoin has already changed the way we think about and use money but indirectly it will change so much more than just that because it proves that decentralized selfgovernance is possible across a global network not only that but decentralized governance holds many significant advantages and very few disadvantages over centralized alternatives bitcoin points to a possible future of decentralized societal governance that is superior in fairness transparency efficiency and resiliencethe ideal of democracy is a noble cause no doubt but the decay of liberal western democratic societies with spiraling debt levels and increasingly polarized proletariats combined with the rise to power of more authoritarian states like china points to the fact that our natural concern for others descends into flailing pedagogy unless its built upon a strong foundation of personal responsibility the intensified spread of more extremist forms of socialism in countries where the idea of freedom for the individual has served as a cornerstone of society but is now increasingly considered only as an afterthought illustrates this well people are no longer free to choose how to behave instead were told how to behave â€” and not for our own sake but for the sake of everyone elsedont get me wrong i very much support the idea of helping those in need over the last decade ive dedicated a massive amount of my own personal time energy and resources toward building a nonprofit social development initiative in my community the mission still lies very close to my heart but what that experience has given me is that ive witnessed first hand again and again that one simply cannot help a person thats uninterested in helping themselves no amount of effort from outside will change anything unless a person takes ownership of whatever problems they faceas intuitively obvious as this may seem ive watched in frustration as the government in my country seeks to solve all problems on behalf of everyone taking everything away from individual ownership and moving it toward state ownership despite their questionable track record and despite the fact that only  of the population in south africa carries  of its tax burdenthe current president is following through on his policy of land redistribution based on expropriation without compensation this is despite the fact that it goes against the south african constitution and the fact that the same policies failed miserably in neighboring zimbabwe whose government warned ours not to go down the same road redistributing land isnt as easy as it sounds especially not if its done to appease an angry population by diverting attention away from government failures in the case of zimbabwe this policy led directly to one of the highest hyperinflationary periods in history with the national currency being completely abandoned after inflation peaked at an unbelievable  sextillion percent yearonyear in midnovember in theory these socialist policies are based on noble ideals i do believe that we should take care of one another if i didnt i wouldnt have made the immense personal sacrifice needed to build and sustain a decadelong social development initiative however i believe its far more efficient and effective for individuals and not governments to assume that responsibility anyone who digs just a little bit deeper will find that very seldomly and in very few countries do these policies have the intended consequences and time and again it leads not only to chronic mismanagement and record debt levels but also to populism driven by intolerance and sentiments of entitlement politicians eager to shift the blame for past failures can easily play into this and exploit the human tendency to avoid change at all costs knowing full well that people will jump at the opportunity to get something in return for doing very little while happily ignoring the failures behind the hand that feeds themthere is a solution but the solution isnt bitcoin not in and of itself there is no societal panacea in my experience the solution is individual and personal responsibility thats an incredibly inconvenient truth for people who have become as dependent on government for their survival as governments have become dependent on the peoples dependency for its own survival the crux of the inconvenience lies within the fact that some people learn personal responsibility and some dontfor those that dont theres very little that can be done other than trusting that life itself will eventually lead them to a situation where they have no other choice a moment which many never come not until theyre on their deathbed and must face the fact that no one else can take that final step on their behalfbitcoin doesnt fix that what bitcoin does is point toward the solution its there for those that are prepared to look given the proper tools people can govern themselves when they do it it can counterintuitively for most deliver better results bitcoin proves that we dont need to comply for the sake of compliance if a voluntary governance structure works bettereverybody knows you cannot build a house starting with the roof what then makes us believe that society can be built that way if as i suspect its because most people assume that selfgovernance will result in chaos then theres never been a more incisive question posed in response to that assumption what does a completely decentralized and leaderless network worth more than a trillion dollars say about that nearuniversal assumption and make no mistake it is an assumption there has never been a truly free selfgoverning society in recorded history while the idea is nothing new a concrete example of what that might look like did not exist until bitcoin came aroundthis is a guest post by hermann vivier opinions
