marathon digital holdings one of the largest enterprise bitcoin selfmining companies in north america has successfully mined its first “clean” blockin late march the company announced that it would be launching the first north american bitcoin mining pool fully compliant with us regulations including antimoney laundering aml and office of foreign assets control ofac’s standards“while institutional interest in bitcoin is accelerating many large funds and corporations have expressed concerns over purchasing bitcoin that may have been tainted by nefarious actors” said merrick okamoto marathon’s chairman and ceo in the announcementmarathon mined its first “clean” block five days after the company began directing  of its  exa hash per second ehs hash rate to the “compliant” mining pool in the announcement the firm shared that it expects to entirely switch to the new pool by the first quarter of  and will start accepting other usbased bitcoin mining companies to join the pool on june  marathon can filter transactions using an exclusivelylicensed technology from dmg blockchain as such the pool refrains from processing bitcoin transactions from people listed on ofac’s specially designated nationals and blocked persons list sdnthe company’s ability to select which transactions it includes in a block seems contrarian to bitcoin’s philosophy for many in the space bitcoin miners shift transactions and vary the “nonce” in an attempt to find a valid block hash and are usually economically incentivized to pick transactions based on their feescensoring bitcoin transactions at the mining level has been fairly uncharted territory up to now and it is unclear what the ramifications could be it is arguably dangerous to some vital bitcoin properties as a medium of exchange such as its fungibility and censorship resistance if some coins get treated differently than others based on government regulations and that could pose a challenge to the free exchanging of bitcoin worldwidein abiding with aml and ofac standards marathon is effectively censoring people from participating in the network ofac has historically taken action against bitcoin wallet addresses associated with sanctioned individuals the office’s first publication of that kind involved two iranian nationals described as individuals that “us persons generally are prohibited from dealing with”on the other hand the mining business is a purely free market miners can join and leave as they see fit and validate whichever blocks they choose their actions and most other bitcoin participants’ are dictated by the gametheoretic nature of monetary goods as freemarket believers most bitcoiners ultimately trust that the market will handle itself with game theory helping it gravitate to the most efficient sideit is also important to note that marathon’s is not a particularly influential mining pool the company’s hashing power accounts for less than  of the total bitcoin hash rate at the time of writing per blockchaincomtherefore marathon’s decision to mine only “clean” blocks currently pose a minimal threat to bitcoin users having their transactions censored the mining pool would need a much more significant share of bitcoin’s hash rate to start causing an actual impact and most miners which are mostly geographically dispersed outside of the us have little to no reason to discriminate transactions based on american legislation
