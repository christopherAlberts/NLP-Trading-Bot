new york cnn business bitcoin may be the king of cryptocurrencies but its facing an environmental backlash over the energyintensive technology underpinning ita new crypto called chia says its the ecofriendly alternativelike most digital currencies chia runs on a decentralized ledger system known as blockchain but unlike bitcoin chia which was founded by the inventor of bittorrent claims it has a much smaller carbon footprint with its mining process of verifying and recording transactionschia logged its first trades this week joining a crowded crypto scene at a time of frenzied investor interest in alternative digital assetswhat is chiathe chia network created the coin in  with a focus on the environmental implications of digital currency mining — the highly specialized energyintensive computing process that creates new coins by solving complex equationsthe key difference between chia and other cryptos according to its founders is its proofs of space and time method of verifying transactions that utilizes unused disk space on users hard drives and is more energyefficient than bitcoins proof of work modelthe chia network was founded by bram cohen who also invented the peertopeer filesharing system bittorrent and has already won backing from prominent investors such as andreessen horowitz and naval ravikanthow does the process workevery cryptocurrency has its own method for verifying transactions typically by using the collective computer power of miners who are paid for their help in cryptocurrency the chia mining process which the chia network calls farming relies on using empty computer storage space insteadchias proof of space and time process allows network participants to show that they have been physically storing data over a certain period of time according to coin market capthis doesnt resemble the mining process of cryptocurrencies like ethereum  for example in its current iteration ethereum uses proofofwork which requires a massive amount of computer power to harvest and mine the decentralized coin the proposed ethereum  however would use a proofofstake model which is allegedly more energyefficientpart of the appeal of cryptocurrencies is that people can send or receive money without the involvement of traditional banks or government bodies unlike a fiat currency controlled by a central bank all transactions are verified and recorded by huge networks of computers using a database called blockchain typically that process requires a huge amount of electricity to power those computers — some estimates put bitcoin minings carbon dioxide output as equivalent to new zealandscohen told cnn business he hopes to have chia listed on crypto exchanges soon including coinbase the digital currency exchange that went public in aprilready to farmchia is meant to be accessibleweve designed our software with the intention of it being usable by anyone who can use the internet cohen told cnn business since farming doesnt require massive amounts of power cohen said it can be done in a normal apartmentthe chia network has a blockchain transaction platform called mainnet which can be downloaded on the networks website chianet  to start farming you have to download the program to your computer and allocate a certain amount of space to the network through the user interfaceit involves completely normal hardware rather than super custom and expensive stuff cohen said most people have some amount of unused storage space they can do it with alreadyand since farming doesnt use a ton of energy you can fire up your laptop and get to work some other cryptocurrency mining processes however require complex machinery and will send your electricity bill through the roofbitcoin miners typically have to have their machines running  to have the best odds of getting a return on the investment and maximize profitability digital currency economist alex de vries told cnn businesswill it save energythe chia farming process is a greener mining alternative but it does still require electricitywhen it comes to cryptos environmentally friendly is a relative term said nick spanos ceo of blockchain technologies corp a software company computers need power to run and natural resources are used to build hard drives much in the same way that electric vehicles and windmills still require too much resources to truly be environmentally friendlyplotting the process of creating files that are later harvested as part of the farming process still uses computer hard drive space and cpu power but it requires significantly less energy than what is required for the mining process for other proofofwork cryptocurrencies
