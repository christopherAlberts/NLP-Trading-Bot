does not care about bitcoin personally the clients of big and small us banks are clamoring for access to the worlds first and most popular cryptocurrencysince the onset of the  pandemic bitcoin has been pitched as a form of digital gold that can protect investors from rising inflation and the debasement of fiat currencieshowever pushing the narratives aside a technical analysis of bitcoins historical price patterns shows that the cryptocurrency still has more room to run in the short to mediumterm according to kevin kelly the head of global macro strategy at delphi digital a digital assets research firmspeaking at the bloomberg wealth summit on tuesday kelly used four charts to illustrate bitcoins upward price potential by dissecting its price cycle longterm price momentum seasonality and investor adoption curve charts illustrating why bitcoin has more room to runkelly first compared bitcoins current cycle in orange to its prior cycle in white as shown in the chart belowwhile it is not a perfect oneforone correlation he believes that bitcoins current price cycle is relatively on track compared to its historical trendsbloomberg delphi digitalwhat we typically tend to see is we see a lot of hype around what bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market are doing a lot of the innovation happening and price tends to get a bit ahead of what we call fundamentals within this market kelly said you tend to see a bit of a parabolic move a blowoff top and then this long extended period of consolidationthats exactly what happened coming into this most recent bitcoin price cycle which suggests that the price has still more room to run in the current cycle kelly saidhe also tracks bitcoins longterm price momentum which is illustrated in the chart below as bitcoins price in the top panel and its monthly relative strength index in the bottom panel in technical analysis the rsi is a momentum indicator that measures the extent of recent price changes to determine whether an asset is overbought or oversoldbloomberg delphi digitalfrom this chart kelly deduces that although daytoday volatility within bitcoin remains the cryptocurrencys longterm momentum has really begun to strengthenthis is evidenced by a parallel that he saw towards the end of  where bitcoins monthly rsi broke into overbought territory by crossing above the  level from there on bitcoin had a parabolic rise returning over  from november  through its december  peakhe saw a similar pattern at the end of last year when bitcoin again became overbought youre starting to see a bit of consolidation here as of recent as price got a bit ahead of itself he said again this leads us to believe in the next  month timeframe we still think that bitcoin has legs to it and still has more room to rundespite working with limited data given bitcoins  history kelly has also examined the ebbs and flows of bitcoin performances over different quarters the seasonality of the cryptocurrency is displayed in the chart belowcoin metrics delphi digitalhe noticed that the early months of the year are historically when bitcoin tends to struggle for example bitcoins price slumped at the start of   and  after relatively large gains in the years priorthat potentially explains why bitcoin tends to lag in performance during the first quarter and surge in the fourth quarter of a given year one of them being potentially investors selling some of their assets or some of their bitcoin to be able to pay the taxman because the irs has certainly come cracking down on a lot of people as of recent he said but the other is just what you would expect with any type of parabolic price movebased on the seasonality indicator the upcoming summer months and fourth quarter could other periods when bitcoin outperforms other asset classes he saidanother more qualitative indicator that kelly tracks is the crypto investor adoption curve as shown belowdelphi digitalwhile bitcoin was started as a grassroots movement in  its progress over the past decade has been largely driven by cryptocentric retail investors venture capital firms and hedge fundshowever as a number of prominent global macro funds and family offices took positions in bitcoin that has sped up the adoption of crypto from registered investment advisors financial advisors and the private wealth management industryin my opinion i think theres going to be one of the next big waves of crypto investors and crypto adopters because one theres client demand for it kelly said but two i think the outlook for the broader traditional asset landscape is a bit more bleak than it has been in the past decadethe next decade for the emerging crypto economyin the crypto space the rising tide of bitcoin over the past year has lifted almost all cryptocurrencieskelly argues that the entirely new class of investable assets has come at a time when global investors really need it especially due to the dismal expected returns from the majority of the traditional asset classesas shown in the chart below while stocks continue to promise doubledigit returns over the next decade bonds and commodities are projected to produce lower singledigit returns at bestresearch affiliates delphi digitalits not going to be as ripe of an environment for global investors and so thats why i think theres going to be more capital that tries to find and is still hungry for growth assets that arent weighed down or burdened by some of the debt levels you see in traditional public markets kelly said crypto can be certainly a very nice tool in the investor arsenal for a multiasset diversified allocation profile
