bitcoin is a real electricity guzzler depending on the estimate the global energy required for mining the most successful cryptocurrency is between  and  terawatthours a year that is about half of what all data centers — for the internet cloud computing the entire financial sector and all other cryptocurrencies — consume germanys entire annual power consumption is just over  terawatthoursthat is why bitcoin and the entire blockchain technology on which it is based are suspected of harming the climate especially since currently about  of the socalled hash rate — the combined computing power for mining and processing bitcoins — is provided in asian countries and none of them generates more than a quarter of its electricity from renewable sources in addition another combined  of the computing power comes from russia and the us which are not exactly pioneers in green energysustainable mining in the far norththats why bitcoin mining in scandinavia is considered a green way out of this dilemma iceland was one of the trailblazing countries according to the icelandic blockchain foundation  of all bitcoins have been mined there using geothermal and hydroelectric power stateowned landsvirkjun and other energy companies generate nearly  of the islands electricityits so cheap that for years there has been talk of laying an undersea cable to the uk to deliver green power to europe where its much more expensive instead the decision was made to attract energyintensive industries to the island including aluminum smelters and the blockchain industryone of the first companies to build a bitcoin mine in iceland was genesis mining in  its founders include philip salter who is now chief technical officer of affiliate genesis digital assets and can sum up the island nations advantages in one line there are no political or geopolitical risks the infrastructure is very reliable and the electricity is sustainable and incredibly cheap he told dwiceland is reaching its limitsmeanwhile however the countrys generating capacity is reaching its limits there could be very little excess energy in  and  landsvirkjun ceo hordur arnarson told bloomberg recently therefore the cost advantage of icelands electricity is on the linein recent years the cryptocurrency mining industry has already grown much faster elsewhere today icelands global share of bitcoin mining has fallen below  or even  depending on whos counting mining pioneer salter says he can understand why icelanders dont want to sacrifice their unique natural resources for more power capacity besides there are alternativesthe scandinavian mainland is also a popular location for mining companies norway has already overtaken iceland in terms of hash rates salter thinks that sweden also has what it takes to become a hot spot for bitcoin prospectors especially in the north of the country where we also operate a mining farm the conditions are comparable to those in iceland he saidexisting geothermal pictured and hydropower plants in iceland are reaching their limitsis scandinavia in for the same faterenewable energy is available in such large quantities in scandinavia that some countries hardly know what to do with it the nordic region has for the front year an expected oversupply of power of nearly  terawatthours a year under average weather conditions olav johan botnen an energy analyst at norwegian market researcher volue insight told dwhowever the demand for electricity from heavy industry is also growing there especially for the production of green steel here iron is processed into steel using renewable electricity and green hydrogen instead of coal sustainable hydrogen is also produced from water using renewable electricitytwo consortia have big plans in northern sweden in the small town of boden which is also home to the genesis bitcoin mine and in the nearby port city of lulea two huge plants are to be built by the end of the decadethe  terawatthours of electricity already generated annually by hydroelectric plants and the  terawatthours to be generated by europes soontobe largest onshore wind farm are not expected to be enough to meet demandbitcoin explained how it works and what it is good for the cryptic token bitcoin is thought of as a digital currency because it exists only virtually without any physical coins or notes it resides in a decentralized encrypted network that is independent of commercial or central banks this allows bitcoin to be exchanged under the same conditions all around the globe its also a cryptocurrency because it uses encryption to conceal users identities and activitiesbitcoin explained how it works and what it is good for bitcoins mysterious founder the cryptocurrency was first publicly described in  by an unknown person — or group of people — who used the name satoshi nakamoto its implementation began in january  when it was released as opensource softwarebitcoin explained how it works and what it is good for how to get hold of bitcoin there are three different ways to acquire bitcoin first you can buy the cryptocurrency with legal tender eg dollars and euros at online exchanges such as coinbase or bitfinance second you may accept bitcoin as a payment in exchange for your products and services and third you can create your own bitcoins in a process known as miningbitcoin explained how it works and what it is good for no bitcoins without a wallet before you can buy bitcoin you have to install socalled wallet software onto your computer it contains a public key your address as well as a private key that allows only the owner of the wallet to send or receive cryptocurrency smartphones usb sticks or any other digital hardware or cloudbased data storage can serve as wallet without the digital wallet no bitcoin for youbitcoin explained how it works and what it is good for hats off for bitcoin purchases to see how the process of paying with bitcoin works lets imagine mr x wants to buy a hat from ms y first thing ms y needs to do is send mr x her public wallet address which is like her bitcoin bank accountbitcoin explained how it works and what it is good for a chain of blocks after mr x has received the public wallet address of ms y he signs off the transaction with his private key to verify that he is indeed the sender of the digital currency the transaction is now stored on the bitcoin blockchain with thousands of other transactions that are made with bitcoin every daybitcoin explained how it works and what it is good for miners in the digital age now mr xs transaction is broadcast to all other participants in the peertopeer blockchain network which are also called nodes essentially they are private computers or miners which verify the validity of his transaction after that the bitcoin gets sent to ms ys public address where she can now unlock the transfer with her private keybitcoin explained how it works and what it is good for the bitcoin machine room theoretically everyone can become a miner in the blockchain network but most of it is done in huge computer farms that boast the necessary computing power bitcoin processing keeps transactions secure by chronologically adding new transactions or blocks to the chain and keeping them in the queuebitcoin explained how it works and what it is good for an irreversible string of data the bitcoin transaction between mr x and ms y is finally included in a vast public ledger the blockchain where all confirmed transactions exist as blocks as each block enters the system all users are made aware of each transaction who has sent how many bitcoins to whom however remains anonymousonce confirmed a transaction cant be reversed — by anybodybitcoin explained how it works and what it is good for controversial mining for bitcoins miners generate new bitcoins when they process transactions which they do using special decryption software once solved a new block is added to the chain and the miner is rewarded with bitcoins china is the biggest miner in the bitcoin network its cheap electricity from coal gives it a competitive edge over rival miners mainly in the us russia iran and malaysiabitcoin explained how it works and what it is good for powerhungry bitcoin due to the massive computing power needed for crypto mining and processing the bitcoin network consumes vast amounts of energy — about  terrawatt hours of power per year university of cambridges bitcoin electricity consumption index has calculated the cryptocurrency requires more energy than each of the countries shown in blue on the map above graphics per sander text gudrun haupt author gudrun hauptare underwater cables a viable solutionthe nordic countries want to further expand their renewable electricity production but this can only be done as easily as before in northern sweden and finland says botnen in the more densely populated south as well as in norway and denmark land is now scarce and therefore more expensiveadd to this the increasing integration of the northern and central european electricity markets several marine cables already connect scandinavia with the netherlands poland and the uk the nordlink cable now connects norway with germany and more are planned the nordic area is expected to increase to a level closer to the major european countries spot power prices said botnen for scandinavians that means prices will go upthe energy analyst expects electricity prices to rise by around  over the course of a decade to € to € per megawatthour on the spot markets i think it will be possible to sign longterm ppa contracts from onshore wind farms near € per megawatthour over the coming four years in northern sweden for any new industries also bitcoin miners according to botnencould bitcoin actually drive renewablesphilip salter is confident that sweden will remain an attractive location for bitcoin miners nevertheless it is questionable to what extent the scandinavian countries are making bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies greener at all the blockchain industry in all five countries together accounts for about  of the global hash rate according to figures from cambridge universitymining expert salter looks at the problem from the other side i think our industry is actually driving the expansion of renewables not just in scandinavia but especially in developing countriesthis is supported by the fact that wind and solar power plants are the cheapest sources of electricity that can be installed today some of the best locations for this are in developing countries but the truth is that bitcoin mining increases electricity demand and until more renewable electricity is generated bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be run using fossil fuel energythis article has been adapted from german
