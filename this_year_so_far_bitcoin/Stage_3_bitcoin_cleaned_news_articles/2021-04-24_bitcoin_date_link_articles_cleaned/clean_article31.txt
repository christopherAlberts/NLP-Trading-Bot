football fans and players as well as prince william boris johnson keir starmer and the prime ministers of france and italy in oppositionon friday jp morgan which is run by billionaire banker jamie dimon finally admitted its mistake in a very short statement “we clearly misjudged how this deal would be viewed by the wider football community and how it might affect them in the future” the bank saidjpm which made a record profit of  £ in the first three months of the year or  then added just five more words “we will learn from this”the spectacular collapse of the deal in the face of opposition from so many quarters has prompted fresh questioning of the wall street bank’s ethics just weeks after chief executive dimon told shareholders in his annual letter that he was a good citizen and part of the community “we take great pride in being a responsible citizen at the local level – just like the local bakery”dimon  added “we have long championed the essential role of banking in a community – its potential for bringing people together for enabling companies and individuals to reach for their dreams”the esl plans have indeed brought people together but only in anger and with much of it focused on jp morgan and dimonlord jim o’neill of gatley former chief economist at goldman sachs and lifelong manchester united fan described the esl plan as “one of the most ridiculous proposals i’ve ever seen in my life” and said it called into question dimon’s judgmentfans were united against the esl plan photograph oli scarffafpgetty images“how on earth did such an experienced chief executive that is so good … on connecting with the real world how on earth did they let themselves get this proposal to where it got” o’neill said in an interview with bloomberg tv“it is ridiculous and epitomises so much that has become wrong about modern sport and in particular football”dimon who was paid  £ last year and is estimated by forbes magazine to be sitting on a personal fortune of  has so far not spoken publicly about the collapsed dealbut while the bank now says it “misjudged” the scale of public feeling about the deal it is known that some bankers raised serious misgivings months before the deal was completed jp morgan called on its “public responsibility committee” to investigate the merits of the proposal which was approved despite some on the committee advising against going aheadcritics both inside and outside the bank again point to dimon’s letter sent to shareholders earlier in april in which he said “to a good company its reputation is everything that reputation is earned day in and day out with every interaction with customers and communities“when i hear examples of people doing something that is wrong because they could be paid more it makes my blood boil – and i don’t want them working here”aleksander ceferin the president of the european governing body uefa described the jp morganbacked esl plan as “a closed shop run by a greedy select few”under the league plans the owners of the  founding teams – nicknamed the “dirty dozen” by uefa’s vicepresident karlerik nilsson – would have received a € to € “welcome bonus” with

backing for them“i’m shocked that in the middle of what’s become an existential crisis for many football clubs this clique of owners have displayed such appalling selfishness and a callous disregard for their fans” he said“a super league monopoly strikes at the very spirit of the beautiful game – it shuts out the underdog offends our british sense of fair play and reduces football to numbers on a spreadsheet”before the plans were scrapped javid called on the government to introduce a “new super tax” on football club profits “that should splash enough red ink on their spreadsheets to quickly put an end to these destructive anticompetitive proposals”dimon who has four times been named by time magazine as one of the  most influential people in the world has also hired the former shadow

was recorded on tuesday  april but not broadcast until fridaybut after the deal collapsed on wednesday pinto said “it is clear we misjudged the magnitude of feeling that this deal would create and we will learn from this experience as a company in the end football fans were heard loud and clear and that’s what matters most”while pinto insisted the deal would not hit the bank’s reputation the
