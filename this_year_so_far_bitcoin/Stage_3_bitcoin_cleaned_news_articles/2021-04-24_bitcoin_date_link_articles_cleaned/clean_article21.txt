businessjack dorsey cathie wood and elon musk are promoting the idea that bitcoin mining could be good for the planet this is not exactly truethe basis of the idea is that mining cryptocurrencies uses a lot of power and can be deployed at any timethat could help a developer make money mining coin at a time when there’s lots of wind or sunshine but not much electricity demandmaking better use of wind and solar power where electricity generation can be intermittent increases efficiency lowers prices and helps encourage the green transitionthe theory is based on trends that are already happening regardless of cryptocurrencies the cost of renewable power is plummeting and an increasing share of energy is being supplied by renewable electricitythere are so many existing incentives that the international energy agency expects wind and solar to account for about  of electricity demand by  up from  in wood says new research ideas – published in a paper by her ark investment management and dorsey’s square inc – “debunk the myth” that bitcoin mining is damaging the environmentread taxman has an eye on your crypto profitson twitter dorsey said bitcoin “incentivises renewable energy” musk responded “true”but there’s still the fact that the mining devours massive amounts of power bitcoin mining now uses  times more electricity than it did in  citigroup said in a recent reportthe centre for alternative finance at the university of cambridge in the uk estimates that mining bitcoin uses more electricity than the netherlands does in a yeari don’t know how you’d assess the risk profile of a bitcoin mining operation albert cheung head of analysis at bloomberg new energy financeto further incentivise renewables crypto miners could sign longterm agreements to buy green electricity that’s what major companies like amazon do to help cut their carbon footprintit has helped fuel a boom in renewable power assets in the usin their research ark and square proposed that a renewable power project could be built without a grid connection just to power a bitcoin operationthat would speed up development but would also make the project riskier in the eyes of a lender as the grid connection might never materialise making a development completely dependent on miningbut part of the rapid decline in the price of renewables has also been thanks to cheap financing a bank would probably want to charge a higher interest rate on a project that plans to sell power to a bitcoin miner than it would if the customer were googlealbert cheung head of analysis at bloomberg new energy finance said “i don’t know how you’d assess the risk profile of a bitcoin mining operation you want your offtaker to be around for  years or at least ”for now lots of bitcoin are being produced by the most polluting source of electricityresearch from the centre for alternative finance shows that bitcoin mining is dominated by china a country currently driving the boom in new coal power plantsin the second quarter of last year the latest data available the world’s biggest polluter mined as much as  of the currencyread how social media networks are used to lure people into investment fraudby comparison iceland and other nordic nations once seen as a green haven for bitcoin were producing less than  of the currency eachtheir traditional surplus of geothermal hydro and wind power is rapidly shrinking iceland’s biggest utility said that no one would build more power capacity just to feed bitcoin miningpollution from mining bitcoin in china is expected to peak in  releasing as much carbon dioxide as all of italy according to a study published this month in open access journal nature communications and by using coal to generate most of its power harmful carbon emissions keep going upthere may also be better uses for renewable power than making bitcoin including decarbonising existing energy demand that relies on burning fossil fuelsas teslas and other electric vehicles replace petrol and diesel cars they will need a lot more electricityother major polluting industries such as steelmaking chemical production and aviation could also potentially use the cheap green power to make hydrogen – bloomberg
