the price of a bitcoin has fallen back this week from its record high at  that it reached on april bitcoin is at this writing priced at € and  but analysts say that the pullback is temporary and that the original cryptocurrency is headed higher in the coming monthstimothy peterson global macro manager at cane island alternative advisors who predicted bitcoin’s meteoric rise this year sees bitcoin’s price rising steadily and over  to  years he justifies his analysis “estimating bitcoin’s adoption curve and maximum price” in a paper published in december “bitcoin’s adoption curve follows a path very similar to that of internet adoption both adoption functions can be modeled with a gompertz curve this tracks growth based on intense activity at the start and end of a given periodpeterson’s model forecasts a scramble for price growth at the end of bitcoin production and beyond one that will push the price to at least  million within  to  years peterson sees the possibility of it going as high as  million over that periodreaching that point does depend somewhat on events negative events would further reduce the value of the bitcoin network these obstacles include internet access government intervention competition and obsolescence peterson warnsmost of us however invest for not quite such long periods as the  to  years peterson takes for analysishowever in the shortterm most analysts see the recent pullback as a shortterm event profittaking and consolidation are at work again as in most recent pullbacks a number of analysts agreedata website coinmarketcap along with a number of other analysts cited a blackout in china’s xinjiang region due to a series of fires in local coal mines as part of the cause for the bitcoin price pullback “the blackout halted no less than onethird of all of bitcoin’s global computing power we’d seen estimates that high but this shutdown confirms them” says alex de vries an economist who runs the website digiconomist which tracks bitcoin’s energy consumption”katie stockton senior analyst at fairlead strategies agrees that sentiment is still strong for bitcoin “despite the pickup in shortterm volatility stockton sees intraday declines of about  per cent to  per cent as not impacting the longerterm price movements“the breakouts that we’ve already seen in bitcoin have already been exceeded” said stockton in an interview on coindesk tv‘s “first mover” stockton thinks that bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase and she expects to see a decisive breakout from the current phase in the near termtechnical issues ironed outpositive forecasts for bitcoin take into account that most of the technical issues in the bitcoin network have been resolved “early on major concerns revolving around bitcoin were ‘will it get hacked’ ‘is decentralisation a truly workable solution’ ‘will halving break the system’ etc now a decade down the road many of these issues have been answered bitcoin works on reliable technology and it does not break” insists one analysthowever there are technical issues that continue to make bitcoin hard to work with“there are issues regularly discussed in the industry” warns blockchain technology expert jack tanner they are“bitcoin cannot scale well enough to be used as a global currencybitcoin consumes a huge amount of energy about the same amount as the country of chile and with the effective carbon footprint of new zealandthe cryptocurrency is extremely slow at processing transactions making it difficult to usebitcoin has account names in the form of cryptographic keys which are difficult to understandthe bitcoin network expects users to be solely responsible for their account management making the loss of funds and key management difficultthe network has high transaction fees which would be even higher if it were to be more adoptedbitcoin also has extreme price volatility making it too unpredictable to be used as a currency that most people in the industry do not think that bitcoin iscan be a daytoday currency”bitcoin is still an inflation hedgemany hedge funds are buying up bitcoin as an inflation hedge and these investors support the rise in price for the coin there is considerable concern among investors that the extensive quantitative easing programme that the federal reserve and the european central bank are undertaking will lead to an increase in pricesin the us the federal reserve has cut shortterm interest rates to near zero and is increasing liquidity with its bond purchases as the economy recovers federal reserve governor jerome powell announced that the fed might allow inflation to run higher than its initial twoper cent target before raising interest rates again this unprecedented approach sparked a safehaven search among investorsone such is billionaire fund manager paul tudor jones who has been buying up bitcoin in may in anticipation of rising inflation – he currently holds about  million in the coin“the reason i recommended bitcoin is because it was one of the menu of inflation trades like gold like tips breakevens like copper like being long yield curve and i came to the conclusion that bitcoin was going to be the best inflation trade” jones told cnbc last monthas stockton points out there is always daytoday volatility with bitcoin far more than one would see in other types of investment the trick is to keep an eye on longer term trends
