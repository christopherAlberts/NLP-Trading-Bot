april    min readthis story originally appeared on marketbeattime to start buying bitcoin againwith bitcoin down more than  we’re sure there are no few bitcoin crypto btc holders wondering if this is the beginning of the end what we want to point out is that historically every time bitcoin has corrected it has always bounced back to produce mindbending returns even the  implosion driven by the chinese regulatory crackdown a correction that shaved  off the price of bitcoin at its low bounced back and look how much btc has gained since about  that’s not something to thumb your nose at the point we’re trying to make is that bitcoin may be down but it’s not out the correction may deepen but we don’t think so and here are four reasons whyfour reasons why bitcoin will bounce back stronger than ever bitcoin is still the dominant cryptocurrency  even with bitcoin’s dominance slipping in recent weeks it is still the leading cryptocurrency by market cap bitcoin the original cryptocurrency is worth about  of the  trillion cryptocurrency market and will likely remain  for a very long time at worst we expect this coin will fall to  or roughly equivalent with ethereum crypto eth over time but we also think these two ecosystems can exist side by side where bitcoin is a very simple relatively speaking blockchain network with limited functionality ethereum is intended to be and is a globallyscaled financial supercomputer simply put bitcoin is digital gold while ethereum aims to be the infrastructure of global digital finance regardless interest in both coins will rebound and one will aid the other bitcoin’s hashrate is still trending higher  the hash rate or the amount of computing power available in the bitcoin network is down in conjunction with price action and that is not unexpected the takeaway is that the decline in hash power is in line with the underlying trend strongly up and ready to rebound as it has every other time hashing power has dipped one reason we expect a rebound is the difficulty level with the hash rate down so sharply the difficulty of mining a new bitcoin is reduced and that will attract miners back into the network rising btc prices will also attract bitcoin miners back into the network there may be some volatility in this figure over the next month or two but by the end of the summer btc hashing power should be back at new highs scarcity  even with the ongoing mining activity bitcoins continue to become scarcer not only are btc’s lost every day they are often burned to produce value in other parts of the cryptosphere at last look there were about  million circulating bitcoins of a total of  million bitcoins possible to mine of those at least  are lost or otherwise irrevocably irretrievable what this means is that we know where these bitcoins are they are in a wallet recorded on the blockchain but the keys to retrieve them are lost there is no way to know where the wallet is who owns it or even how to get into it we’re sure you’ve heard the stories the takeaway like most commodities the scarcer it is the higher the price acceptance  bitcoin is in the midst of rapid acceptance by mainstream financial institutions it’s been slow to build but over the past two quarters there have been at least a dozen major financial institutions such as morgan stanley and goldman sachs who’ve come out to say they’re offering cryptoservices along with this is the rollout of bitcoincryptocurrency services by the likes of paypal that includes paywithbitcoin services for its  million customers and  million merchant clients and then there is the coinbase global ip coinbase is the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange and it’s only getting more popularthe technical outlook bitcoin is nearing bottomthe price of bitcoin is trading at a new low right now but inside a range that we think will produce a bottom this support range is consistent with prior lows that should produce a strong bounce the indicators and price action suggest price may fall a little bit more but with stochastic so oversold the rebound may only be days away if not closer in the near term we expect to see btc move sideways and bottom in the range of  to  before moving higher mid to longterm we see btc moving back up to the  and breaking out with more convictionfeatured article support level
