craig wright self declared inventor of bitcoin arrives at federal court in west palm beach florida us on friday june   wright must reveal how much of the digital currency he owns in a suit accusing him of swindling a collaborator out of more than  billion half of the alleged stasha copyright lawsuit brought by craig wright — the man who has claimed to be satoshi nakamoto the pseudonym used by the creator of bitcoin — could finally put to bed the yearslong mystery over who actually invented the multibilliondollar cryptocurrency thats because the success of the lawsuit would likely depend on wright proving that he did in fact author the white paper that originally laid out the technology behind bitcoin and the case could force the uk court to weigh in on whether or not wright is the actual inventor of bitcoin according to reuters and in fact wright says he has evidence that can prove he is the author of the white paperthe lawsuit and how wright could prove he invented bitcoinlondons high court ruled on thursday that wright the australian computer scientist who first said in  that he created bitcoin eight years earlier could serve his copyright lawsuit against the anonymous operator and publisher of the website bitcoinorg according to reuters wrights lawsuit accuses bitcoinorg of copyright infringement for displaying a copy of the infamous bitcoin white paper which he claims he wrote in  outlining what bitcoin is and how it works hes asking the court to force bitcoinorg to remove the white paper from the website bitcoinorg has refused to remove the white paper from the website and posted a statement in january saying wrights claims are without merit wrights goal is to provide evidence that he is the author of the  white paper and thus that he is satoshi nakamoto the pseudonym used by the mysterious creator of bitcoin his lawyer told reuters in bringing this copyright claim our client dr wright will be serving evidence in support of his assertion that he authored the bitcoin white paper that he released in  simon cohen a lawyer with british law firm ontier who is representing wright said in a statement provided to cnbc make it the case will turn on whether the court is satisfied that dr wright did indeed author — and owns the copyright in — the white paper and therefore that he is satoshi nakamoto wright has not yet revealed exactly what evidence he plans to put forward to support his claims in court but there is a convincing way to prove whether wright is nakamoto says william and mary law school professor eric chason who researches cryptocurrencies the strongest evidence that mr wright could put on would be if he could show control over some of the early bitcoin mined by satoshi nakamoto chason says yes experts believe that the inventor or inventors of bitcoin mined a portfolio of more than  million bitcoin — a stash that today would be worth just shy of  billion wright would also likely need to rely on a cryptographic expert to verify the authenticity of his evidence in order to win the approval of a court says chason and wright may have other avenues to explore to support his copyright claim according to chason for instance he could show the ability to access nakamotos accounts on the online forums where the bitcoin creator interacted with developers and the cryptocurrency community in the early days of bitcoin or if he has computer files showing research or writing on bitcoin as a concept that predate the  white paper or even dated correspondence such as an email to a colleague showing an early draft of the paper or bitcoin research that could be enough to sway the court it would be a great courtroom drama though if he could just go to court and press a button transferring control of some of the bitcoin known to have been mined by nakamoto chason says that would be convincing and a pretty cool storyhow the mystery came to bein  the ninepage white paper outlining the idea for bitcoin was published to a mailing list for cryptography enthusiasts by an author calling themself satoshi nakamoto the white paper described bitcoin as a purely peertopeer version of electronic cash  would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution nakamoto then officially launched the first version of bitcoin software in early  collaborating with software developers and coders online over the next couple of years to improve the software in  the value of a single bitcoin was roughly  cents and by the end of the year the total value of the cryptocurrency topped  million however no one ever knew the true identity of nakamoto as experts believe the pseudonym could have represented either one person or even a group of people the mystery around nakamoto only deepened in  when the pseudonymous creator stopped working on bitcoin altogether and essentially disappeared handing control of the opensource code that enables the use of bitcoin to software engineer gavin andresen who was among the developers who helped to refine bitcoins software in its early days meanwhile whoever nakamoto is may have walked away with about  of the cryptocurrencys total value that had been mined since who people think satoshi nakamoto isover the past decade as bitcoin has grown to reach a total market value of roughly  trillion speculation has swirled over the true identity of its creator in  tesla ceo elon musk publicly denied that he was nakamoto after blog posts suggested he might be behind bitcoin three years earlier a california man named dorian nakamoto whose birth name was satoshi had been reported to be the bitcoin creator but he later denied those claims and said hed never even heard of bitcoin other potential candidates have included computer engineer nick szabo who invented a bitcoin predecessor called bit gold in the late  however szabo himself has regularly denied being nakamoto while nakamotos online posts originally identified himself as a man in his  living in japan some people have pointed to nakamotos early posts in online forums which used british spellings and phrases like colour and bloody hard as proof that the bitcoin creator could be originally from england or a british commonwealthcraig wright has said hes nakamoto before
