the price is highthe premise is that creating a bunch of demand for an asset  by convincing a lot of people to place orders for it  raises the value of that asset when those in the know then sell their positions for a big profit the artificial value quickly drops and everyone left holding the asset loses outsometimes these schemes are orchestrated by a group of nefarious investors deliberately manipulating the market for their collective profit sometimes the investors are unwittingly pumping the value of a currency that a scammer convinced them is the next hot investment unaware of the scheme they fail to sell before the price drops and only the scammer profitsto avoid falling victim to this scheme don’t ever invest in something based on a tip from someone who was paid to tell you
