in the futureexchanges such as binance let individual investors deposit a relatively small amount of money upfront to place an outsize bet for instance suppose a trader buys futures that pay off if bitcoin rises against the us dollar if bitcoin climbs the trader’s profit could be many times greater than what could have been made simply by buying bitcoinbut if bitcoin falls the trader can be on the hook for big losses and must quickly top off the account with fresh funds or else the exchange will automatically liquidate the trader’s holdings“you have potential for a series of cascading liquidations happening back to back to back said chris zuehlke global head of cumberland the cryptotrading unit of chicagobased drw holdings llcadding to the weekend’s chaos some exchanges including binance reported glitches in the midst of heavy trading volumes traders said their inability to access exchanges dried up liquidity—which was already thin over the weekend—and exacerbated price moves

that the exchange recently reduced the amount of leverage it offers on many products and that only a few users were using  leveragestill traders said the swiftness of the weekend selloff underscores the role of heavily leveraged bets—many of them by individual investors—in fueling this year’s cryptocurrency rally“at its core bitcoin is still heavily driven by retail who choose to use a lot of
