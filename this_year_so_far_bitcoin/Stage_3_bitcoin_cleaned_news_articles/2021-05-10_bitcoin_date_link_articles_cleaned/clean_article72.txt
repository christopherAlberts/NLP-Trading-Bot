its not a bitcoin etf but it might be the closest thing well have to it right nowbitwise asset management the cryptocurrency index provider is planning on launching the bitwise crypto innovators etf bitq this week its not necessarily the elusive bitcoin etf that the market has been clamoring for but it is designed to target companies that operate within the crypto and blockchain spacesaccording to the sec filing from bitwisecrypto innovators include parties that operate crypto asset trading platforms custodians and wallets financial services providers leveraging crypto assets andor blockchain technology or other financial institutions principally servicing clientele involved in the crypto ecosystem distributed ledger infrastructure and transaction validation services eg crypto asset “miners” and technology hardware software and solutions providers to participants of the crypto ecosystem these companies also include issuers that own a material amount of crypto assets or otherwise generate revenues relating to crypto asset or distributed ledger technologydogecoinas is often the case with funds that target a narrow segment of the market that companies that qualify for the index is a combination of those tightly and loosely tied to the industrythe inclusion of crypto trading platforms and custodians makes sense as does the inclusion of blockchain tech companies defining technology hardware software and solutions providers can get a little more dicey a qualifying company may indeed have a presence in the space but if its a relatively small portion of their overall business it could water down the degree of pure crypto exposurethe index uses a rulesbased methodology that segments companies into two primary market segmentstier  companies “crypto innovators” companies that a derive more than  of their revenue directly from the crypto ecosystem or b have more than  of their net assets accounted for by direct holdings of bitcoin ether or another liquid crypto asset and in either case are not involved in bankruptcy proceedings crypto innovators will make up  of the index at the time of each rebalancethis segment is your more direct exposure to the crypto space id expect this group to consist of a number of smallcap names but the  requirement helps insure that youre not saturating the fund with ancillary tech companies with a comparatively small presence in the spacetier  companies companies that are not classified as crypto innovators have a market capitalization of at least  billion and either a have a significant dedicated business initiative explicitly focused on the crypto ecosystem that is reported in at least one of the company’s official quarterly or annual filings from the past  months including initiatives involving the purchase sale development custody mining trading transacting in processing transactions with or holding of crypto assets or derivative instruments that track the value of crypto assets or b hold at least  million of bitcoin ether or another liquid crypto asset as a balance sheet asset tier  companies will make up  of the index at the time of each rebalancethis is the segment that i think needs to be watched carefully the  billion minimum market cap requirement means youre going to have a lot of largecap tech and financial services companies in this group its a similar criticism i have with the capital link nextgen protocol etf koin it considers itself a blockchain etf but its requirements for what constitutes a presence in the blockchain space are so loose that it ends up looking like a plain vanilla largecap tech etf if youre top holdings are microsoft intel visa nvidia and paypal how much blockchain exposure are you really getting the qualification of companies that simply hold at least  million of crypto assets could also create some interesting inclusionswell need to see what the funds composition ends up looking like but i think the  allocation target makes sense at a high level and should allow from some pretty direct exposure to the space its also worth noting that the fund does not plan on holding cryptocurrencies directlyconclusionbitwise is a leader in the crypto index space and theyve done a real nice job with some of the other indexes theyve created so im inclined to believe that this index and this fund will look appropriate to its objectivei imagine that the fund has the potential of looking a little top heavy there are only so many companies out there with  of their revenue being derived from this space and the fact that  of the funds allocation will go to these companies can heighten concentration riskwhile this etf likely wont garner the interest that a pure bitcoin etf would if it were ever to finally be approved it should be an intriguing alternative to those still looking for exposurealso readarkk is down  from its highs is it time to sellthis multiasset etf with a  yield could be just what your portfolio needstop performing etfs for
