level by the end of parabolic bull markets can rise to heights that are irrational illogical and unreasonable forecasting bitcoin’s price amounts to little more than throwing a dart at a dartboard given its volatilitydan morehead pantera capital’s ceo expects bitcoin to reach  per token in  and the  level by august he made the forecast when bitcoin was at the  level in august a recent article on forbes opined that bitcoin could hit  per token by the end of this year its impossible to pick tops in bull markets or bottoms in bear markets the market showed us that on the downside last year on apr  when the price briefly fell below negative  per barrelthe only forecast i can make is that market trends are potent forces that guide the path of least resistance for all asset prices the in bitcoin remains firmly intact however history suggests that it awaits another event that would thrust it back into the stratosphere of higher highsetfs could light the ultimate bullish fuse the sec will take a cautionary approachmicro bitcoin futures should increase liquidity for investors and traders but futures remain a niche platform with a limited overall addressable marketbitcoin and the other thousands of digital currencies await the sec’s approval of etf and etn products that would undoubtedly turbocharge the price action to a new leveletfs trade on the stock market which makes them available to the broadest audience of market participants given the interest from younger investors bitcoin and digital currency etf and etn products may increase the overall level of participation in the stock marketthe decision is now in the capable hands of sec chairman gary gensler as the head of the cftc under the obama administration chair gensler oversaw the early days of approval for the cme’s bitcoin futures contract after his tenure at the cftc he taught a fintech course at mit making him a true fintechiemeanwhile at the sec chairman gensler’s primary concern will be protecting the investing public the volatility in digital currency prices is a reason for proceeding with extreme cautionat his latest press conference in late april fed chairman jerome powell was asked about his view of the dollar becoming a digital currency his answer was likely in lockstep with chairman gensler’s approach as the fed chair said “it is far more important to get it right than to do it fast”expect the same process from the sec for etf and etn products on bitcoin and other digital currenciesmicro futures at the cme should increase the addressable market for bitcoin and the asset class however the etfetn market is the  gorilla that could ignite another period of speculative frenzy pushing prices to higher highsmeanwhile the trend is your friend and it is bullish but historical volatility that routinely moves above the  level is a reason for extreme caution
