a sudden and unexpected death millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency gone amateur detectives poring over digital puzzle pieces in a desperate bid to reclaim whats theirsif you paid attention to the world of cryptocurrency over the past decade the story of quadrigacx might sound familiar at least in the beginning anywaythe now defunct cryptocurrency exchange an online clearing house of sorts where mom and pop investors could turn dollars into bitcoin or ethereum was once the largest of its kind in canadafounded in  by gerald cotten by late  the exchange had approximately  registered users and supposedly held roughly  million worth of cryptocurrency in a combination of socalled hot and cold storage digital wallets that was in addition to the  million in assorted fundsand then in late  cotten unexpectedly died while honeymooning in india — taking the digital keys to his customers cryptocurrency to the grave with himor at least thats the tragic tale his widow told the world at the time but something about the story didnt sit right with aaron lammer the host and coproducer of exit scam an eightpart investigative podcast series on quadrigacx that premieres mondayit sounded like a scam observes lammer in the shows first episode and in bitcoin if something sounds like a scam it usually isover a freewheeling phone call last week i spoke with lammer — who cofounded longformorg and cohosts the longform podcast — about the new podcast series he coproduced with lane brown the not uncommon belief that cotten is still alive and the ongoing effort to exhume cottens bodythe below conversation has been edited for length and clarity you can listen to the first episode of exit scam on spotify apple podcasts and other platforms nowjm can tell us a bit about your work and your relationship with cryptocurrencyal i started getting interested in crypto around maybe like  after being pretty dismissive of it you know i have a long history of being wrong about cryptocurrency it wasnt like the minute i heard about it i was deep in it i started getting interested in bitcoin in  kind of right when the big first altcoin boom was happeninga lot of what drew me into crypto was the crazy stories i like the stories of these weird little coins where the developer turned out to have been using a fake name and purported to be some other person who had never even heard of the project i just think those stories are incredible so i started this podcast cointalk which was cohosted with jay caspian kang who writes for the new york times magazine and we kind of caught serendipitously that first big insane bull run when some of these coins were going up  percent in a day it actually has a lot of echoes of whats happening right now with dogecoin but this was the version one of it with some like weird clone of ripple or like a weird ethereum clone that some russian guy was running and you know people were buying and selling them they had funny logos and i kind of got hooked on it honestly less so the making money part and trading — which i am not particularly great at — and more so the finding the crazy stories partjm yeah the human element of cryptocurrency has always stood out to me as well im interested in developments like defi and decentralized exchanges but what i want to read about are the scams and the stories — thats where a lot of the excitement is in my mindal they go hand in hand as people push further forward into cryptocurrency as an industry and as a field of innovation its ripe for people to do fake things and blend in with the people doing real things so strangely youre going to encounter the scammers and the charlatans whether youre interested in them or not they sort of just go where the puck is going where the moneys going where the interest is goingjm which brings us to quadrigacx what inspired you to make exit scam and how long have you been working on ital i mean when i first started working on this podcast i didnt know that i was making it into a podcast i was just really interested in the storywhere the story was when i first heard about it was that there was this exchange in canada called quadriga it was the largest exchange in canada and the founder went on his honeymoon trip to india he arrived in jaipur and he had a serious stomach pain he was known to have crohns disease and pretty much within a day he went to the hospital and died and after he died it was revealed that he hadnt shared his passwords with anyone and that these private key passwords locked up all the money that the exchange had that his customers had and the company went into creditor protection because it no longer had access to its own moneyof all the stories id heard this one was the craziestthis news came out while i was still hosting cointalk and of all the stories id heard this one was the craziest it had all of these elements that alone would be incredible and yet they were all in this one story youve got this really mysterious death youve got the fact that this guy is basically running a whole exchange more or less by himself and you have the fact that there was no plan for what to do in a situation like this so after following a lot of these stories this was just the one that i couldnt let go of and i was still following really closely and talking to other people investigating the case and at some point i was like that would be a good podcast you know because the story was so complicated honestly that i was like if i want to get anyone else into the story i need to simplify it and break it down and organize all this stuff because it was just all over the internetjm right and the story gets even wilder and more complicated than it seemed at firstal okay so basically after quadriga filed for creditor protection this accounting firm called ernst  young was brought in to look into whether there was any money to recover for the quadriga customers who lost money and what ernst  young concluded was they basically went and looked into these wallets where there should have been hundreds of millions of dollars frozen and concluded that the wallets were emptythe wallets were empty the whole timeand in fact that the wallets had been empty for about eight months before gotten even left on his honeymoonif you look back you can see people on reddit who are figuring out pretty rapidly that the wallets are empty now those people didnt know for sure that the wallets they were looking at were the actual quadriga wallets the accountants because the wallets had been turned over to them did know but yeah i mean that was not public knowledge immediately for a long time people were laboring under the idea that this was this kind of funny viral story about a guy who didnt tell anyone his passwords and it cost his customers  million — which would have been a tragedy in its own rightbut then in the middle of that story we find out oh no the wallets were empty the whole timejm which brings us to the name of your showal yeah an exit scam at least in crypto — and i think there are actually exit scams in other industries — but in the cryptocurrency sense an exit scam is usually someone behind a crypto business sometimes a person who has a coin out sometimes an exchange will usually make some excuses like theyll say oh we got hacked or we had a technical difficulty there was a glitch and as a result weve lost your money or you know we dont have access to your money now but well be able to get it soonand then generally the people disappear and before customers know whats going on theyve completely lost this person along with all their money theres been a lot of exit scams in darknet markets where basically a successful darknet market will continue to accept money and then a month or so elapses people realize nothings getting shipped and the person behind it has basically just made off with the funds these kind of schemes were really common during the altcoin run that i talked about earlier its sometimes called the world of shitcoins these are tiny currencies or small exchanges that specialize in exotic smallcap altcoins i lost my money on one called cryptopia actually i had money on this total flybynight altcoin exchange and the proprietors exit scammed id like to make a podcast about them too thatll have to be season twoexit scams are happening all the timeexit scams are happening all the time theres a turkish exchange that the founder exit scammed like a week or two ago and took off with  billion is whats believed and a consistent quality of exit scams ill say is that theres a lot of things that people say were an exit scam and its not clear whether it was until someone really looks into it deeply some of the legitimate hacks that have happened — i mean as legitimate as a hack can be — people will say oh they didnt really get hacked it was an exit scam so just because something looks like an exit scam doesnt necessarily mean it wasbut i guess what i want to say is that the climate this quadriga thing happened in its not that rare that the actual explanation for one of these things would be an exit scamjm how did you approach reporting this story were people involved with quadrigacx willing to speak with youal i mean we talked to everyone who would talk to us but gerry  was a pretty reclusive person you know he was not a social guy a lot of people in the crypto space who become famous are basically using their clout to make money theyre promoting themselves on twitter and have paid groups and all this kind of thing theres a lot of that but that wasnt the kind of guy gerald cotton was at all he kept a pretty low profilewe did talk to people who knew gerry we talked to a couple people who lost money but honestly the people who lost money didnt know any more about what happened than you or i did the experience of losing money turned a lot of them into detectives however and we learned a lot from that community of detectives who pursued this case in fact i would say i learned more from them than i ever discovered myself a lot of our path was to take all of these different sources of varying levels of believability — everything from really excellent reporting in the globe and mail to reddit threads — and to try and turn that into a coherent story and talk to the real people behind the story so that were hearing from people who knew gerry not hearsay on redditjm how large is that community of detectives and among those people how prevalent is the theory you explore in exit scam — the theory that gerald cotten isnt actually deadal that theory is extremely prevalent i would be remiss if i were not to mention that the majority of these people that i have spoken to think theres a very good chance that gerald cotton is still alivegerald cotton being alive is not the only mystery to the storybut ill also say that gerald cotton being alive is not the only mystery to the story if gerald cotton really did die of natural causes in india then theres still a lot of money that needs to be accounted for so i think that the people who are looking into this case are trying to figure out what happened at every level what happened to the person what happened to the money how did this happen how was this person even in a position to do this its not common that one person has sole control over hundreds of millions of dollars its pretty rareits unusual for an exchange to have such a concentration of power generally there are pretty accepted best practices in terms of multisig wallets and really basic things exchanges should do and when none of those things are in place you have to question why why did someone build a system like thisjm youre saying that its not just that cotten dropped the ball in setting up and managing quadrigacx its that he never tried to even hold one in the first placeal or that potentially this power structure was by design because it facilitated that person to do things that he wanted to dojm so theres this prevailing theory that cotten faked his own death and an ongoing effort to exhume his body to prove that its not really him in that grave has that happenedal the body has not been exhumed and i dont know that it ever will be the authorities are as far as i know under no legal obligation to exhume the body and ive heard no indication that there is any imminent move to do sojm do you see this story as representative of the larger crypto space as were in this second boom is there a lesson that the cryptocurrency community can draw from ital well i think that one lesson that i would draw from the story of quadriga is that a lot of people who are in opsec and infosec will tell people that you have to keep your own private keys and you know write them down on a piece of paper and i think that those people have been validated by this story and that theyve been screaming from the mountaintops that you shouldnt keep your coins on exchanges for a decade nowand gerrys story has proved them righta lot of people sent gerald cotton money because he seemed like a nice canadian guyhowever i also think that this story shows that when a risk comes to you it may not be a hightech risk it may be something very classic and old like a ponzi scheme ponzi schemes dont rely on some kind of high technology they rely on the same thing they relied on in the early  century which is peoples greed and sense of fomo and peoples innate trust of other people a lot of people sent gerald cotton money because he seemed like a nice canadian guy and it was a canadian exchange and people liked supporting it or people sent him money because it was the biggest exchange in canada and that made it seem legit and what he did was manipulate those peoples perception of what he was doing and he didnt use any particularly hightech tools to do so he used classic confidence techniquesif i was canadian i would have gotten hosed by gerald cotten too you know theres an expert i interview on exit scam a guy who worked on the quadriga case and he told me the greatest weakness in the password is the human and he means a truly random password is very hard to break but he breaks a lot of peoples passwords because their password is the name of their dog and i think when it comes to cryptocurrency the greatest weaknesses is the human too its not the nameless hacker who is going to somehow get your coins off you — that could happen too — but it might just be a greedy guy who owns the exchange where you have your moneyso i think as long as people are involved theres probably going to be more gerrys out therethis guy was the founder of the biggest exchange in canada he took a honeymoon trip to india three days after he signed a new will and he died very suddenly his customers lost  million plus as a result of him not sharing his passwords and when i heard this story it just didnt add up so this podcast is me trying to add it up its following all the leads and trying to make sense of this story and trying to figure out what really happenedepisode one of exit scam premieres monday may watch how to buy use and spend bitcoin
