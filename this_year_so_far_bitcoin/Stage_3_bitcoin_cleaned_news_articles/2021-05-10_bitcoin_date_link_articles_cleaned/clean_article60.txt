by now most accountants and tax professionals are familiar with the irs’s question about virtual currency on the first page of form  and its treatment of cryptocurrency as property with sales and exchanges reported on schedule d perhaps you have even had clients bring answer “yes” to that question on their organizer or ask questions about their cryptoasset reporting requirementsit’s crucial for tax advisors to get ahead of these issues yet many aren’t aware of the reporting and technology challenges inherent in this new asset breedoverview of cryptocurrenciesin case you’ve been studiously avoiding the bitcoin headlines recently let’s start with a quick review of what cryptocurrency iscryptocurrency is decentralized digital money designed to be used over the internet bitcoin and ethereum are the most wellknown cryptocurrencies but there are thousands more out therethe appeal of cryptocurrency is the lack of central authority people and institutions can transfer value online without any banks or payment processors as intermediaries and the currency isn’t controlled or issued by a governmentsecurity is another advantage all cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on a blockchain which acts as an immutable digital ledger keeping track of all transactions the blockchain is distributed across all network participants and those participants work together to keep it organizedwallets vs exchangesone common source of confusion for people new to the cryptocurrency arena is the difference between wallets and exchanges some people even use the terms interchangeably an exchange is a service or platform that enables clients to trade crypto for other resources such as other cryptocurrencies us dollars or other currenciesthink of exchanges like banks they use custodial accounts to hold their users’ funds and then track them on an internal ledger to trade and exchange funds trades are made “offchain” and no actual crypto is transferred as a result of these trades they’re only making changes to the ledgersthere are over  actively tracked exchanges worldwide and they handle anywhere from  billion to a few thousand dollars in daily transaction volume coinbase which just went public on nasdaq under the ticker symbol “coin” is the largest with over  million verified usersif the blockchain is the overall ledger a public key is the account number and a private key is the password or pin needed to access the user’s account public and private keys are stored and encrypted in a cryptocurrency wallet wallets are used to track ownership and to receive or spend cryptocurrencies they don’t store the cryptocurrency they store the private key used to sign transactionswallets may be “hot” or “cold” hot wallets are connected to the internet and are more userfriendly but less secure they’re good for daytoday transactions cold wallets are not connected to the internet and are harder to use but more secure they’re good for longterm holdingcryptocurrency reportingwhen your client comes to you and says they have cryptocurrency transactions the first thing you need to do is gather information from them to account for and report taxable transactions properly however accountants and advisors face several hurdles to gathering that information forms it would be great if your clients provided a  showing the proceeds and basis for each cryptocurrency transaction however if they give you an irs form it’s likely to be a  or  showing gross proceeds the irs and cryptocurrency exchanges haven’t yet figured out how to handle information reporting for cryptocurrenciesunfortunately  and  don’t provide any beneficial information they don’t consider cryptocurrency moving off one exchange and into another or to an onchain wallet  all moves are reported as taxable transactions and included in the proceeds on the  form currently those forms are just a big arrow pointing the irs to the taxpayer it’s up to clients to provide the detailed information needed to calculate their crypto taxesit’s a good idea to discuss the possibility of receiving an irs notice based on these informational reports with your clients if they do receive a notice it’s helpful to have a way to reconcile the  to taxable versus nontaxable transactionsbitcoin mining usb devices in a row with small fans arina habicharinahabich  stockadobecoma typical report will include information about the transaction type proceeds fees and where the cryptocurrency went what’s typically not included is the cost basis or where it came from exchanges roughly  percent of cryptocurrency owners hold their cryptocurrencies on an exchange the major exchanges provide some sort of transaction reports for users — usually in an excel spreadsheet pdf or csv file the trouble is each exchange has its own format they may even use different symbols for the same cryptocurrency for example one may refer to bitcoin as btc while another calls it xbtc onchain transactions all transactions are written into the blockchain with a client’s public key you can see all the transactions over the blockchain’s lifetime however clients may be using wallets cloud and desktop wallets usually have an export option apps hardware and paper wallets typically don’t screenshots or manually maintained spreadsheets may be all the taxpayer can providein most cases accountants will receive a mixture of  spreadsheets and screenshots if you’re using scanandpopulate software it will recognize  and  but send information from those forms to schedule c or “other income” on schedule  rather than schedule d this can overstate ordinary income and understate capital gains if not corrected and of course the software won’t be able to autopopulate anything from spreadsheets or screenshotsthere are several consumergrade cryptocurrency tracking solutions out there that your clients may use but these aren’t ideal for firm use becausethere are no client management realtime client collaboration or team management features your crypto clients may be highnetworth individuals so it’s important to control who has access to their datathey’re not soc auditedthey don’t consistently account for fees the instructions for form  are very clear taxpayers need to deduct selling expenses from proceeds and add fees for purchasing to basis when calculating a gain or loss on a property transaction but another challenge here is that sometimes fees are taken out of the client’s crypto for example if an exchange charges a  transaction fee it may use a portion of the client’s bitcoin to cover the fee rather than taking the fee in us dollars this results in another taxable event trading virtual currency for a service fees can be significant if you’re not accounting for them correctly gains can be overstated causing your clients to pay more in tax than they shouldthey don’t integrate with professional  tax solutionsthese limitations often result in a lot of unpaid work for the tax pro trying to sort out a client’s transactions account for fees and ensure all transactions are correctly reported on the client’s tax returnis your firm preparedis your firm prepared to seamlessly incorporate
