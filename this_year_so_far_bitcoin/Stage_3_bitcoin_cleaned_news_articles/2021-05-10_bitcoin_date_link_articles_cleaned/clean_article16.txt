needed to mine them is more than is used by entire countries and results in huge volumes of carbon emissions at a time when many countries are targeting zero emissions bitcoin and nfts represent a real threat to the environmentwhat’s bitcoinbitcoin is a cryptocurrency a decentralized digital currency that bypasses a central bank and can be sent from user to user on the peertopeer bitcoin network transactions are evidenced through cryptography and documented in a publicly distributed ledger called a blockchainthe currency is created as a reward for mining – using computers to solve complex mathematical algorithms its finite  around  million of the  million bitcoins available have already been minedat first average computers could solve the algorithms but as the puzzles got harder – a consequence of greater mining  they could not keep up special computers with huge processing power are required and these need a lot of electricity  around  terawatts annually equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of argentinathe new collectiblenfts are digital collectibles stamped with a unique string of code and stored in blockchain they allow you to buy or sell ownership of unique digital items and track who owns them they have risen to prominence recently fetching huge sums at auction as bidders pay for digital works such as twitter ceo jack dorsey’s firstever tweetwhen you upload a digital piece and ‘mint’ it it becomes mineable just like bitcoin powerful computers are used to solve complex puzzles using lots of energy in the processthe platform of choice is ethereum the secondlargest cryptocurrency after bitcoin which uses ‘proof of work’ to create digital assets whoever solves the puzzle first gets the asset added to their blockchainthe emission problemboth bitcoin and nfts generate huge volumes of carbon emissions a single transaction of bitcoin for example has the same carbon footprint as  visa transactions or bingeing youtube for  hours creating the average nft will generate around  kg of carbon the equivalent of driving  miles in the average petrolpowered carthe issue of co  emissions was first raised in  by computer scientist hal finney just two weeks after receiving his first bitcoin transaction but it did not really hit home until a major price rally hiked up energy requirements in  this is projected to get worse  the more the price of bitcoin or nfts increases the more competition there is and the more energy it consumesthe computer power needed to mine bitcoin quadrupled between  and  – but where does this vast amount of electricity come from it could be argued that we are increasingly using renewable sources and research from the university of cambridge suggests that  of miners used electricity from renewables in but there is no way of knowing where miners get their electricity from it is hard to track as rigs often move to where the cheap energy is and in countries such as china the biggest miner of bitcoin there is a lack of cheap renewable energywhy bitcoin is so bad for the planet playvideo credit guardian newsyoutubecoma simple tradeoffbitcoin and nfts are the secure digitalanalog of money and collectibles but they are expensive to maintain critics argue that mining is also a huge waste of resources that displaces real people’s need for electricity while also influencing prices in the power and utility marketsadvocates argue that progress comes at a price but should that be at the expense of the environment ethereum’s creators promise to switch their algorithm from a ‘proof of work’ to a ‘proof of stake’ model to make mining more environmentally friendlyinstead of competing miners will be rewarded based on how much cryptocurrency they own by locking up some of their cryptocurrency in the network miners prove they have a ‘stake’ in keeping the blockchain accurate negating the need for computers to solve the complex algorithms cutting down the computational work means slashing emissionsbut if they do not make the transition to more environmentally friendly mining methods and to using renewable energy it is predicted investors and consumers will look to other
