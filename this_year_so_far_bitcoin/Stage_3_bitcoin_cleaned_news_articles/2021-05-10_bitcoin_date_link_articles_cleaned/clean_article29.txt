the laws which govern our physical realm are the foundation upon which bitcoin is built as immutability would requirethe following article is an expanded longer version of the original medium article of the same name by the author tomer strolight in his series of articles on bitcoin entitled “why bitcoin” covering many aspects of bitcoin each with an average reading time of only three minutesno speed limits lead to faster safer more reliable carsthe german autobahn highways have no legallyenforced speed limits the laws of physics are the only limitations as to how fast automobiles can travel there as such germans have figured out how to make very fast cars fast small cars fast family cars fast suvs fast trucks etcthey have also figured out how to make very safe fast cars because nobody wants to die getting somewhere fast german automakers pioneered advanced safety features like crumple zones that make highspeed collisions less dangerous to vehicle occupantsthe lack of legallyenforced constraints is what makes german cars faster safer and better than those engineered in countries where speed limits and safety standards are prescribed by government edictconsider the challenges faced by german car engineers compared to those in a highlyregulated country where speed limits are far lower than the speeds observed on the autobahn german car engineers need to compete to figure out how to make cars both faster and safer than their other german competitors but their regulated peers in other countries can stop improving their cars once they can safely hit the local speed limit german car engineers become interested in understanding and solving challenges brought about by high speeds affecting reliability aerodynamics stability fuel efficiency high pressures braking acceleration and more their regulated counterparts simply do not have any interest in these considerations nor are they given any budget to research themno manmade laws lead to stronger safer more reliable moneythis same reasoning is remarkably why bitcoin is the best money the world will ever see just as automobiles are an engineered form of transportation bitcoin is an engineered form of moneybitcoin’s first engineer satoshi nakamoto designed it to operate no matter what the universe could throw at it he did not build it to only work under a constrained set of limits dictated by humans thus the mechanisms that satoshi built into bitcoin to enforce its rules are nothing less than the laws of physics themselves no government told satoshi what rules to apply or how to enforce them and now interestingly no government can bitcoin’s rules were chosen to ensure that bitcoin would operate no matter what happenedstrong safe money guaranteedlike the safety and speed goals of german cars travelling on the autobahn highway network there are safety and speed goals too for bitcoin as it functions atop worldwide digital networksbitcoin provides the monetary equivalent of safety which is protection of private property bitcoin lets owners of its units of currency store them where only the rightful owners can find them it does this using astronomically large random numbers as the storage location of these satoshis satoshis being the base unit of currency in the bitcoin systemthe laws of physics dictate that over the entire foreseeable future of the universe nobody can be expected to guess one of these astronomical numbers where satoshis are being stored not even if they converted the whole planet into a giant computer making endless guessesif you hodl satoshis you are guaranteed they will not be stolen by a thief guessing where they are stored as long as you generated your astronomically large random number properly who guarantees this to you not some politician not some businessman not some company not any person the guarantor is none other than the universe itself as long as the laws that hold the universe together hold your satoshis are safesteady reliable money guaranteedwhen it comes to speed bitcoin doesn’t try to go as fast as possible instead it seeks to maintain a constant speed or pace that steady pace that bitcoin is after is to ensure that one block will be added to the blockchain on average once every ten minutes forever this is perhaps why “timechain” is a better descriptor than “blockchain” and is being increasingly proposed as a substitute termonce again satoshi utilized the eternal unchanging laws of physics to engineer bitcoin to always achieve this pace he did so by combining proof of work and a difficulty adjustment to that proof of work to ensure this pace even in the most extreme physical circumstancesif all the world’s energy or even all of the sun’s energy was directed toward trying to accelerate this pace bitcoin would “slam on the brakes” within  blocks at most slowing down the block discovery rate to one block every ten minutes conversely if efforts were made to slow bitcoin down by withholding energy from its miners bitcoin would again within at most  blocks reduce the work requirements effectively “stepping on the gas” to speed itself back up to one block being discovered on average once every ten minutesno government law can change this fact government laws cannot after all supersede the laws of physics nothing can no billionaire no hacker no protester no banker no corporation no army not even the pretentious arrogance of a bowtie wearing awardwinning economist eating russian caviar at a cocktail party for new york’s elites and claiming that bitcoin “has a fundamental value of zero” can change the actual laws of physics thus bitcoin runs without interruption regardless of what anybody thinks of it or tries to do to it bitcoin’s reliable uninterrupted operation is as pure and as real as reality itselftougher standards lead to the better moneyas we did when comparing german car engineers to their peers in countries with low speed limits let’s consider the results of the engineering efforts of satoshi and other bitcoin contributors with those of the designers of the incumbent monetary system — fiat money the rules of the fiat system are dictated by regulators legislators and bureaucrats these rules can easily and at any time be changed by a mere change of dictatewhereas nobody can steal or seize satoshis fiat money is stolen and seized so often that we don’t even keep count of how many times this happens or how much fiat money is affected whereas bitcoin continues to issue its currency units reliably and predictably on a predetermined schedule the fiat money supply goes through wildly unpredictable shocks whenever the people running that system decide to alter ithistory shows that fiat systems collapse the monetary units of these systems become worthless upon those collapses science shows that the laws of physics do not collapse they are eternalto summarize by relying on the eternal and unchanging laws of physics bitcoin guarantees perfect reliability that its promises of property protection and continued operation will always be in force this frees bitcoin and more importantly its users from having to trust any temporary and fallible shortlived entities like people central banks political parties and even nation statesin the final analysis it is ultimately a voluntary decision for each individual to choose whether they prefer bitcoin and the reliability of physics over fiat money and trust in politicians that is a decision to choose science over politics bitcoin itself is in no hurry for anyone to make that choice however like the laws of physics themselves bitcoin is foreverproof of work requires that someone a ‘miner’ in the case of bitcoin be able to produce a very improbably low number as the output of running input data a block header in the case of bitcoin through a function  in the case of bitcoin that produces unpredictable randomlooking numbers but always the same output for the same input if the miner can show that the result of the output from their input is lower than the threshold set by bitcoin’s difficulty setting it is very likely the case that they put in the expected amount of work required by running the algorithm time and again with slightly modified inputs until they finally arrived at a result that met the proofofwork criteriathis is a guest post by
