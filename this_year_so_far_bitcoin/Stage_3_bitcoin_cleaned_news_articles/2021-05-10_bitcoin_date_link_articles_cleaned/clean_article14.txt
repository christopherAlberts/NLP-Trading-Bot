kevin simpson founder and chief investment officer of capital wealth planning joins yahoo finance live to discuss outlook on cryptocurrency and the marketvideo transcript all right jared we dont want you to go anywhere because we do want to continue this conversation on cryptocurrency but also the markets were joined now by kevin simpson founder and chief investment officer at capital wealth planning kevin great to have you with usso we just heard jared talking about cryptocurrency weve seen a lot of moves and i think just about a year ago and even longer than that i feel like so many people were shrugging off cryptocurrency as something that just a lot of millennials were purchasing but not really anything that could be taken too seriously and here now were having serious conversations about a cryptocurrency that was originally based off of a memehow are you approaching the cryptocurrency conversation how do you think investors should be approaching cryptocurrency in their portfolio should they stick with perhaps a bitcoin or should we start seriously looking at something like a dogecoinkevin simpson well kristin great to see you and i think that the conversation about the dogecoin meme should be just that conversation only i cant look at it as an investment we are legitimizing some things that really were started out as a joke i made a comment earlier this morning to one of my team members i said the dogecoin phenomena is making the  tulip craze look legitimate and i just cant get behind the doge tradenow he responded and hes a millennial and really into this stuff he said well youre old and right now bitcoin is old its all about ethereum and i thought ok well can you explain that to me and he said ethereum not only being a cryptocurrency and breaking  its also an application its a utility it has blockchain value that really makes this legitimate so even though we dont invest in cryptocurrency we are absolutely paying attention to itstory continues so interesting that it seems like bitcoin is for the old folks right now why do you think ethereum is catching up to bitcoin i think all the ethereum thats out there right now has a market cap of about  billion but bitcoin is over a trillion dollar market cap its incredible to even say that but is it because ethereum is behind the rise weve seen in these non fungible tokens these nftskevin simpson yeah absolutely because you need that blockchain to create it in fact if you trade crypto in many cases its the ethereum blockchain thats allowing for those transactions to take place so its a fascinating discussion i dont think that ethereum is going to put bitcoin out of business but i think that there is tremendous validity to something within the blockchain space that has application and clearly this does kevin im really glad that you mentioned tulip mania that was about  years ago by the way my long term price target on bitcoin is about  because way back  years ago a single house was traded for a single tulip that happens to be the median home price in the usbut i want to stick with bitcoin here and just get your take on how far the institutionalization of it weve seen tesla buy a billion and a half paypal and square they got to put it on their balance sheet were also seeing wall street trading desk gearing up how much of that is left do you think and how much short is needed to get the price of bitcoin higher because we saw really institutional participation driving the price up gains i guess that we had earlier in the year and especially last yearkevin simpson well thats a great point jared and i think theres three four or five exchange traded funds that are in front of the sec right now that are all applying to be able to create etfs that will make bitcoin more accessible to retail brokerage accountsso there are firms on wall street that are dedicating analysts to this space theyre dedicating resources to be able to trade this space and when you have a limited supply and increasing demand and to your point whatever that demand may be caused by it tends to make prices go higherso were looking as we invest in companies not for their take on cryptocurrency were still looking at old fashioned balance sheets i wanted to come on today with a  hat because the dow broke over  and none of us were on the floor of the exchange to celebrate or blow whistles but if we think about helping our investors i want to stick to fundamentals i want to stick to the basics were going to pay attention to cryptocurrency but at capital wealth planning were certainly not investing in it all right so kevin i do want to ask you then about the markets weve been seeing lately a lot of euphoria quite a bit of green but there is still fear that exists in this market as well what do you see right now as the biggest risks to equities what should investors right now really be the most cautious of going forwardkevin simpson well kristin we got some really good news as bad news medicine on friday with the jobs report and by allowing the wall street pundits to relax on thoughts and fears of higher interest rates fed activity hawkish comments especially after janet yellen made some remarks about fed tightening that has a tremendous impact on stocksso if we see higher rates were going to see the stock market roll over and for now were looking at a dovish fed and thats going to allow us to continue to move higher but even as we look at these graphics theres a tale of two markets here weve seen a modest shift from growth to value over the past few months and weve all talked about it together i think that will continue as valuations and reality sets incompanies that continue to make money and increase earnings are going to be able to do well companies that pay dividends can sustain higher prices valuations on technology stocks have come down a little bit because theres only so much frothiness you can put in you can only look at momentum forward valuations and then you start to think about things as far as how can these prices continue to go higher heck we hit my year end target alreadyso i think that the reopening trade will continue i think the consumer will spend like crazy i think stock markets can go higher but to your point we have to be careful we have to be rational and we have to be willing to get out of some names if we see things that express more weakness and of course looking over at tech it is right now the laggard down about  and  of a percentage point kevin simpson founder and chief investment officer at capital wealth planning thanks so much for joining us today
