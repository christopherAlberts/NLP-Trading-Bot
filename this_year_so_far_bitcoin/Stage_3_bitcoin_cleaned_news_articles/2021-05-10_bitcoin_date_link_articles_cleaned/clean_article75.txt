bitcoin is struggling to find any direction and it will not be a stretch statement to say that the price has been very much consolidating for the last number of days this is quite interesting because if we look at the news flow there is ample optimism every day almost we hear more major institutions including some big banks issuing statements that they will be offering bitcoin to their wealthy clients but if we look at the bitcoin price it seems like it is struggling to keep hold of its gainsfrom a technical price points things are looking weaker the reason for this is that the bitcoin price has clearly lost the battle with the  sma on the daily time frame and the price has moved below this important average in addition to this the price is also struggling to stay above the  sma as well traders will also need to pay attention to the  time frame where things are looking uglier i am saying this is chiefly because the price has crossed below the   and  sma which means we are likely to see more selloff if the price doesnt move above any of these averages any time soon
