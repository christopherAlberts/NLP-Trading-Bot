bitcoin sv the original bitcoinby makkie maclang coingeekbitcoin will forever be remembered throughout history as the pioneer in digital currencies before ethereum litecoin binance coin cardano and tether came into existence there was bitcoin it has been more than a decade since the bitcoin white paper entitled ‘bitcoin a peertopeer electronic cash system’ was published on oct   under the pseudonym satoshi nakamoto however it only reached mass consciousness in  when its value skyrocketed to bitcoin is a triadic term that denotes a digital coin a setinstone protocol and a public blockchain network while bitcoin has since become a household name and blockchain has been gaining ground in the past few years as a viable technology for businesses in various industries such as healthcare gaming social media marketing supply chain and real estate not many people know about their true history and real valuebitcoin historythe first ever persontoperson bitcoin transaction was completed on jan   when nakamoto successfully sent  bitcoins to cryptographer and developer hal finney it was a year after on may   that the first documented bitcoin transaction was created when early bitcoin mining aficionado laszlo hanyecz bought two pizza pies for  bitcoins  worth about  total at that time now  bitcoins would amount to almost  millionfrom its humble beginnings bitcoin’s value and popularity steadily started to rise and people became increasingly curious as to who nakamoto was as his identity remained a mystery public interest was so high that on mar   newsweek published the lengthy investigative article ‘the face behind bitcoin’ that identified dorian nakamoto a japaneseamerican engineer living in california as the creator of the ‘global phenomenon’the next day satoshi nakamoto’s account which had been dormant since  on the  foundation website suddenly became active nakamoto simply replied ‘i am not dorian nakamoto’ in one of his old posts dated feb  in  a year full of upheaval in bitcoin wired and gizmodo published leaked documents and headline stories claiming the largely unknown dr craig s wright was satoshi nakamoto  effectively doxing him and threatening the wellbeing of his business friends and family this prompted a media frenzy which culminated in the removal of gavin andresen from the helm of bitcoin core and caused a fury of problems for wright who very clearly did not want to be a public figure at the timestory continueson may   the confusion came to an end when wright chief scientist of ukbased bitcoin research company nchain addressed the world and admitted on bbc news that he was indeed satoshi nakamotoover the years there has been an underlying dispute within the bitcoin community over the scalability of its blockchain the conflict reached its peak in  termed as the bitcoin scaling war bitcoin split into bitcoin core btc and bitcoin cash bch with advocates of the former labeled as small blockers and the latter big blockers these labels denote those who did not believe in scaling and opted to keep bitcoin’s  block size cap and those who believed that increasing it is the only answer for bitcoin to move forwardfor bitcoin beginners a blockchain is a distributed ledger that records validated transactions on data blocks which are then linked together to form a chain a master copy of the data updated in near real time is stored on all nodes or miners on the network all miners also need to agree if ever a change is going to be made making data practically impossible to be manipulated hence data is distributed and the network is decentralized in order to scale the block size limit needs to be raised enabling each block to contain more data and transactionsat the height of the scaling war in  wright could not take what was happening to his creation anymore with bitcoin nurturing a reputation for being a network focused exclusively on large slow and expensive but presumably unstoppable transactions the only viable use cases for the network were becoming evasive savings and largescale criminal commerce against this backdrop wright made a fiery surprise speech at the arnhem conference in july “satoshi nakamoto didn’t like the crime culture of bitcoin however it was the predominant cultural narrative ‘hey we need a lot of distributed nodes we need to make sure bitcoin can’t be censored and to make sure we can’t censor it we need to make it slow and small enough for people to run their own nodes and create their notion of perfect security’” coingeek chief historian kurt wuckert jr saidfrom the moment wright made his surprise appearance in arnhem he steadily returned to the bitcoin community and became active in order to fix bitcoin and get it back on track  focusing on the technology the economics and the culture that makes bitcoin valuable in  bitcoin cash bch was again embroiled in conflict over the scaling issue while bch had scaled its block size limit set to  many believed that that was enough again some bitcoiners fought against the need for continuing to scale while others wanted to pursue wright’s vision of infinite scalability in late  bch again split and bitcoin sv bsv emerged from the battlewhat is bitcoin sv bsvwith sv standing for satoshi vision it is clear that bsv is all about restoring bitcoin to what wright originally intended it to be since its inception bsv has been dubbed as the original bitcoin about a year after the split the genesis upgrade was released on feb   which successfully restored bitcoin’s original setinstone protocol as close as possible to how it was designed in the white paperaside from scalability bitcoin’s changing protocol and the nature of its governance has been a major issue during the scaling wars a protocol that is often changed means applications built upon it need to be adjusted as well applications would need to stop running and developers would require time and money in order to fully adapt to the new rules furthermore timelocked contracts or escrowed bitcoins were impossible to implement with the shifting sands of the protocol wars  breaking many commercial use cases with a fixed protocol developers can now build a variety of applications and platforms on the bitcoin sv blockchain without having to worry about changes just like how the internet protocol created a trustworthy online economywhat sets bsv apart from other digital currenciesunlike other digital currencies where the coin is the “product” and communities focus on absorbing value for holders of the coin during frothy bull market cycles bsv is built to allow the external creation of value based on four pillars a stable protocol a massively scalable blockchain security beyond sufficiency and safe instant transactionswith the original bitcoin protocol set in stone bsv provides a rocksolid foundation upon which developers can build whatever application or software that suits their needs the genesis upgrade also unlocked the capability of bsv for unbounded scalability and use of the bsv for monetized generalpurpose computation like ethereum but without limitssince then the bsv network has continued to scale massively and this is evidenced by its test network recording  transactions in a single block the size of  at an average transaction fee of  bsv on feb   this proves that micropayments and financial services can be rendered at a very low cost compared to western union or paypalaside from implementing the first ever fully securityaudited bitcoin node software bsv’s security is also the only variant of bitcoin that can benefit from the economic security inherent to bitcoin as a complete system without arbitrary limits and compounding dependencies bsv is public by nature and abides by the rule of lawper the bitcoin white paper all transactions and changes thereof are broadcasted to all nodes on the network their active participation in mining and governance make it impossible for an attacker to successfully conduct a  attack which is the name of an act whereby malicious actors gain control of the blockchain disrupting and reversing transactions for the sake of theft or vandalism of the blockchain ledger the public blockchain also prevents criminal activities as evidence of any illegal dealing is publicly accessible all of these attributes which other blockchain networks seek to remove from their competing protocols make instant transactions on bsv uniquely safe and reliableenterprise blockchain solutionsthe genesis upgrade is just the first step towards bsv’s grand vision of making it an enterprise blockchain that can be globally adopted by businesses at present there are more than  projects and ventures being built on the bsv blockchainusbased ehr data veridat and vxpass are each developing their own healthcare data management platforms norwaybased unisot’s seafoodchain is already providing solutions to the seafood supply chain scotlandbased recycle sv has created an app that streamlines and incentivizes the recycling process and australianbased firm  technologies has already successfully tested out voting platform bvote to accommodate the country’s entire populationthese are just a small number of projects on the bsv blockchain that spans many countries and industries and blockchain conferences are continuously being held to foster global awarenessthe original bitcoinbitcoin has been misused throughout the years and has deviated from its creator’s original vision and although more than a decade late wright has finally stepped up to rightfully claim what was his and steer the project back toward the creation of more economic and personal freedom he is doing this by giving the world the tools to do business more efficiently and by giving people ownership of their data with increased privacy and utility  only possible with the power of bitcoin svsee more from benzinga©  benzingacom benzinga does
