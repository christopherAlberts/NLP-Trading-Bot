china is making promising progress with testing its digital yuan currency it has announced the success of a pilot in suzhou city near shanghai in eastern china where  consumers were given ¥ £ of free money in digital wallets to spend at participating outlets in the double fifth shopping festival between may  and this was part of a bigger test by the people’s bank of china targeting  consumers in  chinese regions since april for those eligible there is a straightforward app to download which gives them a wallet using this to make purchases in thousands of participating stores they receive discountsthe digital yuan is a version of the normal chinese currency deployed on a blockchain which is the tamperproof online ledger technology that underpins digital coins like bitcoin and ethereum however this blockchain is permissioned meaning the people’s bank decides who can use itthe latest round of tests is ten times the size of the original round that took place in autumn  china has also been trialling the digital yuan crossborder between hong kong and neighbouring shenzhen and is developing a platform for making the currency internationally viable that involves thailand uae and the bank of international settlementsevery step forward increases the prospect of china becoming the first country to put its currency fully on a permissioned blockchain no date has been announced but a national rollout seems foreseeable within the next  months most likely in staggered stagesin contrast western central banks like the federal reserve bank of england and to a lesser extent the european central bank have all been been moving more slowly on socalled central bank digital currencies cbdcs they worry about things like getting privacy right when all transactions will be publicly visible on the blockchain and about the effect on retail banksyet a digital yuan raises profound questions about global financial stability the question for the world’s other major economies is how to respondadvantages of digital currenciesthe digital yuan already has the status of legal tender payments using it are fundamentally different from those on payments platforms like alipay or wechat or indeed paypal in the west such services may settle transactions very quickly for customers but behind the scenes are ledgers of large numbers of transactions between the banks of the buyers and sellers and often also intermediary banks that settle hours or even days laterthe digital yuan bypasses the need for these banks there is no service fee unlike these payment alternatives and in theory the speed of payments can be even fasterunlike cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin the currency is also backed by a government this means that issuance of digital yuan is the same as issuance of cash in circulation making it just as secure it gives the government better control over the money supply since unlike with cash officials can see all the transactions taking place at any given timethree dangerslots of central banks have been looking at developing digital currencies some such as japan and south korea are not far behind the chinese the eu is signalling that a digital euro could be four or five years awayfor the laggards there are several dangers the first is around international payments most transactions between different currencies currently use the us dollar as an intermediary via the swift international banking protocol this means considerable demand for the us dollar which brings advantages such as enabling the us government to borrow more cheaply in  for example china alone exported goods worth  billion £ billiontransactions using digital yuan won’t need swift or the dollar with implications for dollar usage in international trade as many as  countries have china as their biggest trade partner and many question settling in dollars as it adds the unnecessary financial risk of adverse exchange rate movements china says it is not trying to replace the dollar with the digital yuan and that the “goal is to allow the market to choose” how to settle international transactionsa second danger is that if central banks don’t meet the demand for digital money market forces will paper money was invented in china during the song dynasty in the  century but it is fast becoming redundant contactless credit cards have become ubiquitous during the pandemic digital money is better still as it costs less to usethird countries that fail to embrace digital currencies could find their central banks losing control over monetary policy to cryptocurrencies – be it decentralised initiatives like bitcoin or centralised ones like facebook’s forthcoming diem currency in other words if these nonsovereign coins become widely used for payment purposes central banks will find it harder to manage their economies by setting interest rates or changing the money supply of course it is possible to ban cryptocurrencies but this stands in the way of progress and all the advantages they bringthe digital yuan is happening amid heightened tensions between china and the us and europe this clearly makes it a worrying time to give the chinese firstmover advantage over this new type of currencyincidentally sanctions such as those recently imposed on chinese officials over human rights concerns will be much easier to bypass if and when the digital yuan is up and running there could well be calls to sanction those using the currency as a result which raises numerous questions about viability and consequences that could be discussed on another occasionbut given how much is at stake it is vital that the us eu and uk begin testing their own digital currencies urgently blockchain is reinventing the way we conduct payments and the risks of being left behind are too great to ignore
