from berkshire hathaways latest shareholder meeting over the weekend and weve also got a few more earnings reviews on tap for you joining me this week its certified financial planner mr matt frankel matt how is everything down there in lovely south carolinamatt frankel its kind of rainy today but other than that its a pretty good day how about you how is it going up theremoser its a little overcast here we had some rain through the night and then into this morning it seems like its clearing up a little bit so hopefully itll be clearing out for a nice weekend or a nice week here but i mean the weather was really nice over the weekend so that was a bonuswell over the weekend while the weather was nice there were probably a lot of people who opted to stay inside for a decent bit of saturday because a little thing known as the berkshire hathaway annual shareholder meeting took place matt that is obviously one of the big events of the year for investors of all walks oftentimes has been referred to as the woodstock for capitalists having the opportunity to go out there one year and actually experiencing the meeting was something ill never forget i mean it was really a lot of fun and being out there with the press badge no less i mean that really made it like the firstclass experience from start to finish if i recall correctly correct me if im wrong but youve not physically been to that meeting yet right you were planning on going and then all of this covid stuff happens so youve had to postpone those plans for a little whilefrankel yeah i had hotel reservations in  had to cancel those then i rebooked it for  and they made this one virtual too  not only was this one virtual i think it was in californiamoser it sounds like this next year though will not be virtual from what i can ascertain is that rightfrankel i hope i hope munger can make the trip because they held it in california to accommodate him this yearmoser yeah were all getting older but hes no spring chicken though i did like the way he phrased his aging i think he is aging at  annualized a year or something to that effectfrankel  charlie munger is who i want to be when im moser  yeah i agree with that im right there with you  i think hes done it right well speaking of charlie and warren and all of the fun stuff that occurs during a normal year at the berkshire meeting  clearly virtual is a bit of a different story but always insightful always educational and we always get some really needed takeaways and this year was no exception i wanted to jump into this with you because we were talking before the show here and there were some things that really stood out to you and i agreed with a lot of it but lets dig into these takeaways because i think youve got five fun takeaways to talk about here today so lets just jump right in with takeaway no frankel yes there were more than five obviously we cant get through all of them you know its a long meeting i cant talk for as long as those two guys canmoser yeah weve got to draw the line somewhere so were just going with this your top five so lets see what you gotfrankel one of the biggest ones is charlie munger let slip who is going to be the next ceo  the succession plan obviously has been a big focus for years warren buffett is  munger is  theyre human beings theyre not going to be leading the company forever i mean buffett has even said he might retire at some point so its been highly speculated who is going to take his place we got some clarity a couple of years ago when they made greg abel and ajit jain the two cochairmen or the vice chairmen of the company to join charlie munger as vice chairman we knew it was going to be one of them and munger said its going to be greg abel he let it slip and then warren buffett confirmed that later on and it makes senseone of buffetts biggest points of choosing a successor is someone who could potentially lead the company for a few decades greg abel is  the other cochairmen or the covice chairmen are  and  if you include munger in the equation the  is the one who is most likely to stay berkshires ceo for a couple of decades if he gets the jobive got to think thats really what made the decision in that respect both are doing great greg abel by the way is currently in charge of all noninsurance operations at berkshire so he presided over the railroad business the utility business dairy queen duracell all the little adjacent businesses pretty much everything but the insurance portfolio and the stock portfolio is currently what he is presiding over everyone pretty much assumed it would be him but now we finally had some real confirmation about berkshires succession planmoser i mean i think youre right i mean i dont know to me at least it felt like it was probably even money whether it would be jain or abel i think there were enough people out there who thought it could be jain given his experience with the business given his familiarity with the insurance business in particularbut to that point and thats what struck me was with mr abel given his biggerpicture focus for the company it seemed like age notwithstanding maybe he was the better choice given his biggerpicture view not just focused on really insurance and he has even said this he tends to stay focused on the competitive threats for berkshire hathaway writ large as a conglomerate as this gathering of so many different businesses hes always focused on those competitive threats in that competitive landscape whereas ajit jain is clearly very focused on the insurance operations for obvious reasons and that plays a very big role in berkshires business to me it kind of feels like they got this one right thoughfrankel i would agree with that i guess age is a big thing and the other thing is that they want to preserve the corporate culture which the culture is have all these conglomerates and dont tell them what to do which greg abel is really the one thats over that part of the business as you said i mean ajit jain i would even make the case that aside from his age hes the favorite of the two leaders in buffetts eyes just reading the praise he has gotten in annual letters over the years but i mean you cant really make the case that theres anyone more connected to berkshires corporate culture right now aside from the two at the very top  whose succession plan were talking about than greg abelmoser yeah and i mean that makes sense too i mean having a company clearly warren and charlie feel like theyve gotten this company to a good place they like the potential they like what the future holds they want someone in place who they feel is in line with what matters most to them and so certainly itd be tough to come up with a name other than mr abel perhaps mr jain but here we are whether it was an accident or not we know a little bit more now than we did before and typically as investors thats a good thingwhat about takeaway no frankel well lets get to the bitcoin part because  lets get this out of the way because i know jason is going to be triggered and offended by these commentsmoser hate mail is addressed to matt frankelfrankel  theyre not my wordsmoser no thats right were just communicating what weve heard but i thought this would be a fun one to talk about so yeah lets dig in a little bit of mungers feelings on bitcoinfrankel first of all buffett dodged the question he even said im dodging the questionmoser its like politicsfrankel he completely understands that his opinion on bitcoin is not a popular onemoser yeahfrankel buffett does munger has always been kind of an unfiltered speaker and whatever filter he had now that hes  is gone hes had some pretty mean comments about bitcoin through the years already he said of course i hate the bitcoin success thats what he said  he said i dont welcome a currency thats so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth nor do i like shuffling out a few extra billions and billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air if that wasnt enough he went on to say that its disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilizationmoser wowfrankel tell us how you really feel charliemoser those are strong words agree with them or disagree with them were talking about obviously his feelings on the matter and granted hes not the only one im sure that feels that way but yeah it does seem like hes opening the invitation for a lot of blowback there from the younger generations of investors who feel like hes too old he just doesnt get it bitcoin is the future whatever it may be everybody has got an opinion on the matter its not like charlie is just some guy who picked a couple of stocks and rode that success hes been part of building something pretty special and pretty meaningful over the last several decades he knows a thing or twofrankel i dont want to get involved in the twitter war i know theres a lot of people at the motley fool who love bitcoin who are big believers in it its a very polarizing investing topicmoser yeah i think its interesting too because you said and these are his words but he refers to it as a currency there is a debate that we had as currency versus asset two very different things it certainly depends on the perspective of how youre viewing it whether its an asset or a currency or something elsefrankel yes what i would say is dont be so quick to dismiss munger as an ok boomer or any of those  i think hes actually above a boomermoser i think youre rightfrankel i think the oldest boomers are in their  right now and hes well beyond thatmoser thats no surprise his feelings on the matter i would imagine with things like dogecoin they just become magnified and so there you go you can agree with him or disagree with him but clearly theres more than one opinion on the matterfrankel i saw something on a chat that said you think his comments on bitcoin are bad youd better be lucky they didnt mention dogecoin because it couldve exploded moser i have a feeling theyre going to be more of these types of things introduced in the near future it will be interesting to watch how this market shakes outfrankel you know what else ive noticed nobody just kind of likes bitcoin  everyone either thinks its the next big thing in finance or theyre charlie mungermoser its difficult for me to fully wrap my head around why it matters ive always said and i stand by this bitcoin bulls to me theyve done a phenomenally horrible job at explaining why it matters im not saying it doesnt dont get me wrong so dont at me understand i dont care i just dont care about bitcoin but what i am saying is theyve done a very poor job of explaining why it really matters you can tell me about decentralized and unhackable and yadda yadda yadda but theyve just done a very poor job of explaining why it really mattersim sure we will get a lot of people explaining from here on out why it really matters on twitter and whatnot thats fine but it will be interesting to watch that space evolve because youre right its either one or the other you either love it or you hate it and i would add maybe a third category and i think i fall on this third category  you just are apathetic you just dont believe in itfrankel i was going to start calling you jason mungermoser i just dont care  theres a third category so i dont lose sleep over it if it works out great if it doesnt work fine you know what i know what i dont know maybe munger will be proud of me because ive realized what i dont know and thats really one of his more famous quotes it revolves around hey know what you dont know because thats when real wisdom starts kicking in well see a sign of a good investor is the ability to change ones mind so maybe hell change his mind one day i dont know well have to wait and seelets talk about your third takeaway here we did a whole months worth of shows on these im not throwing out all of these because there will be some babies that go out with this bathwater but buffetts problems with spacs  talk a little bit about thatfrankel buffett first started talking about spacs when asked about how they affect berkshires ability to find acquisitions he said thats killing their ability to find deals there are  spacs in the market all looking for targets they all have a ton of cash things are getting expensive hes pretty much saying the spacs are overpaying for businesses  hes saying it wont go on forever thats where the money is now thats what people are interested in nowto be fair take that with a grain of salt people have been upset with buffetts lack of ability to find deals for five years now this has been going on for way before the spac boom but the cash is just building up and i think the whole elephantgun quote was before anyone knew what a spac waswith that in mind his point is the spacs pretty much have to deploy their capital within two years which is true thats usually the rule he said if you put a gun to my head and tell me i have to buy a business in two years id buy one i wouldnt necessarily get the best deal but i promise you i would take that money and buy a business with it munger being munger said its not just stupid its shameful talking about the spac boom  but buffett was a little bit more thought out about itmoser i feel like we went over a months worth of shows talking about spacs and the merits then the challenges and whatnot i feel like there are probably going to be more losers in this space than winners but there are going to be some important companies that come from this movement i think there are going to be some important companies that have come public via spac and we wont be sorry that they were able to come public you just have to be very discerning it feels like with this spacefrankel yeah that was essentially the whole underlying theme of the shows we did everyone knows that im a spac investor its one area that i clearly disagree with buffett and munger on i think that out of the  there are probably  you should pay attention to but there are going to be some great companies that go public i mentioned  as one that im particularly a big fan of as a company thats going public via spac i think opendoor which went public through spac last year i think its a big one that has a ton of market potential there have been some great companies that are going public through spacmoser id put appharvest up there personally appharvest controlledenvironment agriculture came public via spac i think thats another one that to me we talk about where we feel the world is headed i feel like thats solving a big problem and i feel like that is a direction that the world needs to be headed whether appharvest goes public this year or five years from now maybe that doesnt necessarily make a difference but maybe it does the spac gives them the opportunity to get public and have those benefits that capital access that they might not have otherwise maybe they are a little bit earlier to the game but i feel there are some companies out there that are important and its just giving them a little bit of an earlier startfrankel yeah think of it like the spac class of  and  like any class youve got your top  that are going to go onto ivy league schools or whatever  with spacs stay away from the bottom of the classmoser well i think you just came up with an idea there i feel like we need to build out an ivy league class of spac recommendations maybe thats how we piggyback off the series of shows that we did earlier in the year on spacs the ivy league spac portfoliofrankel i like it the ivy league basketmoser there you go well as investors we all make mistakes and buffett and munger are no exception theyve made their share as well and warren talked about one of berkshires bigger mistakes and that was takeaway no  for you matt what was one of berkshires bigger mistakesfrankel well one of the things was what buffett said was not mistaken and that was selling the airlines remember he got a ton of criticism for that last year selling all berkshires airline stocks at big losses after the pandemic broke out and he would have made billions if he had just hung onto them now that theyve rebounded he said the airlines have been better off without berkshire involved as an investor and basically his point is that the government wouldnt have been as willing to bail out the airlines if they had an investor like berkshire hathaway backing them upmoser yeah thats a good pointfrankel so i can see that the airlines he says were not a mistake people wanted to hear that he did say that it was a mistake that they sold some apple stock last year he even said that munger tried to talk him out of it  as we know apple is by far berkshires biggest stock positions with well over  billion at this point he sold a small amount not a ton but several billion dollars worth he said that was probably a mistake he also said it was a mistake exiting costco if you remember berkshire sold out of costco in the third quarter last yearmoser i do remember thatfrankel relatively small investment by berkshire standards only  billion so peanutsmoser well im going to put you on the spot here because i feel like this is always something to talk about and ive got an idea of one i would use but thinking of a matt frankel mistake something reasonably that stands out to you as an investor a mistake that matt frankel made in his portfolio does anything stand out to you over the past couple of years something you did that you wish you didnt do in hindsight buy or sell an error of commission or omission it could be eitherorfrankel well i probably shouldnt have sold bitcoin in moser  very good im glad good its humble thats goodfrankel ive talked about this several times i got in on the early days really just to figure out how it works back when bitcoin was in the single digitsmoser yeahfrankel no one knew that it would get to this pointmoser no shoot i remember not all that long ago i sold some chipotle not all of it this was a few years back but i sold some chipotle the majority of the position to reinvest that money elsewhere clearly selling some of that chipotle at i dont know it was  a share maybe at the time in hindsight do i wish i did that well probably could have just left that money alone and it would have done fine and i reinvested that capital in other investments that are performing well so im not sure but thats one that i certainly think about from time to timefrankel i have a better more recent one so early  we started hearing about this coronavirus that was going around asia remember thatmoser yeah i think ive heard of thatfrankel when everyone didnt even pay it any mind we got the first case i think washington state had a few cases at first and everyones like its going to fizzle out whatever the market went down in fear of the coronavirus it wasnt even called  at that pointmoser yeahfrankel it went down a little bit and i put a bunch of money to work saying that this is a silly overreaction in late february i bought occidental petroleum i bought goldman sachs and then the pandemic hit and it turns out everyone was right i was way too early i wish i had put more money to work in late march and not so much in late february i shouldve let at the time the covid scare i shouldve let it play out a little further that was a mistake now i know to just be patient and let things play out before you reactmoser yeah well in hindsight i guess the idea is we know were going to make mistakes its just the real key is figuring out the lesson from it so that you can try to avoid repeating that mistake in the future and it sounds like at least we were recognizing the mistakes and we just got to learn from themwhat is takeaway no  i think this is an interesting one much like bitcoin could potentially ruffle a few feathers but what was takeaway no frankel well it shouldnt surprise you to learn that buffett is not a robinhood trader  if anyone was worried that he was going to jump on the platform and start buying gamestop thats not the case  he criticized robinhood for the gamification of it which weve done on the show a few times weve talked about how robinhood turned investing into a casino and that was their biggest driver of success i would even go so far as to say in  when there were no casinos there were no sports to bet on so that became the casino the no  reddit thread on investing is called wallstreetbets you cant tell me that investing hasnt been gamified when thats whats getting all the headlines so buffetts caution as he said this creates its own reality for a while and it does because how many times have you seen people say on twitter and stuff stocks always go up in the past year moser  stonksfrankel  or things to that effect yeah the stonks or whatever and he says that nobodys going to tell you when the clock is going to strike  and it all turns into pumpkins or mice in some stocks it actually happened some of the really speculative spac stocks or some of their short sweet stocks that weve seen did not always go up lo and behold he did say hes interested in reading robinhoods ipo filing when it comes out but he called it part of the casino groupmunger had some equally nasty comments about it he said its awful that something like that brought investments from civilized men and decent citizens and brought it into robinhoods platform the two are not fans and its just like there are always people who are going to invest in the wrong ways thats why buffetts advice has been so widely followed for so many years this dates way before the robinhood thing ever started people investing in the wrong way but he said that just really adds to the gambling atmosphere of it people have referred to wall street as a casino long before robinhood got involved with thingsmoser sure yeahfrankel so its not that robinhoods making it into a casino its like the casino had the roulette table and robinhood is just adding the flashing lights on top of it which is kind of whats going onmoser well they replied they responded to that there was a blog post this morning from the head of public policy communications of robinhood to counter buffett and mungers comments and ultimately they feel that buffett and munger have insulted a new generation through their comments on robinhoodi guess it remains to be seen exactly how this all works out i think the criticisms that have been lobbed up against robinhood are fair again building something like that from the ground up youre bound to make some mistakes and learn some things along the way so i will not be one to jump on the bandwagon saying that robinhoods days are numbered but perhaps they need to be a little bit more thoughtful on how they build out this platform if they want to really build the next generation of investors as opposed to the next generation of traders or gamblers because clearly they are two very different thingsfrankel yeah for sure im not a robinhood user ive said that there are some cases where it could be a good platform to use especially for cryptocurrency investors ive made that case where its a good place to have everything in one place but one thing is for sure it has brought millions of people into the investing worldmoser yesfrankel whether thats a good or bad thing and theyre doing it in the right way or not its up for debate but they have really brought a new generation of investors into the markets id like to see them double down on education and things like that the way sofi is doingmoser yeahfrankel sofi is partnering with coursera to create personalfinance classes that its giving to its members i would love to see robinhood doing something like that thats really my big issue with robinhood is that they dont emphasize investing they emphasize trading it feels like so thats my big issue with robinhoodmoser well we shall see well thats great stuff thanks for digging into that meeting and like you said of course there are probably countless takeaways but weve got to draw the line somewhere those were five really fun ones to talk aboutbefore we wrap up the show today we have a few earnings reports that we wanted to get to here that came out recently lets just take these one by one and ill go ahead and open up with capital one finance matt what stood out to you for capital ones quarter that was reported last weekfrankel well if you rewind to our bank earnings show last time every bank beat their earnings pretty much every bank had a good quarter especially when you compare it to the first quarter of  when they were setting aside all these reserves the sky was falling this that and the other thingcapital one had a pretty good quarter even without that net income was significantly up over last year a lot of that was reserve releases their net income was  billion they released  billion in reserves out of that about half of their income excluding any reserve activity including their setting aside last year and their releasing this year earnings were up  year over year not terribly exciting but definitely not bad considering that interest rates have gone down considerably since the first quarter of total revenue was down  thanks to lower interest rates for the most part noninterest expense was down  which helped to offset that a little bit they spent a lot less on marketing over the past year for instance capital ones one of the most efficient banks ive heard of especially out of the brickandmortar banks which before i had been to dc to fool hq id never even known that capital one was a real physical bank because we dont have them down here i thought it was just a prank or somethingmoser they were building and everythingfrankel this was years ago yeah heres a capital one building whats that then lo and behold thats where the capital comes frommoser thats rightfrankel  but anyways efficiency ratio is about a little under  which is really good for a branchbased bank net interest margin is almost  most banks are at about  thats because of the high amount of credit card loans which are higherinterest loans the credit card loan portfolio is down  year over year we mentioned this last week last time when we did the bank earnings consumers have had a lot of cash in the way of stimulus checks things like that extra cash being pumped in and theyve had less opportunity to spend think about how much youve spent traveling over the past year compared to the year beforeconsumers have just had less opportunity to spend and extra cash coming in they are spending less on their credit cards thats probably a good thing for society  lower credit card debt but for capital one the credit card loan portfolio was down  their consumer loan portfolio which is mostly auto loans was up  overall that balances out to down  on their loan portfoliothe deposit base grew but not as much as some competitors they now have about  billion in deposits versus only about  billion in loans they have some money to lend their loan portfolio is well covered by lowcost deposits nice capital structure therebut all in all id say it was a pretty good quarter are you a capital one fan being that youre more in their geographic areamoser im not a capital one account holder im not a capital one user but the more i learn about the business the more i actually become a fan of it i like that they have such a strong focus on credit cards and being able to open up that product landscape for consumers with so many different levels it feels like theyve been able to do that very well whereas you look at another company and maybe this just segues perfectly into this next earnings review but a company like american express that has had to pivot from this identity of being a card for the wealthy to really having a card for everyone with that in mind american express was another company that reported earnings here recently we wanted to dig into that one as well what stood out to you there for american express this quarterfrankel well their stock actually took a dive after earnings revenue was down  year over year which in a lot of the cases like we mentioned with capital one earnings were down year over year pretty flat but revenue did ok revenue wasnt down double digits like american express was that i think bothered people a little bit comparing it to the first quarter of  not very useful but just like capital one about half of their net income for the quarter was reserve releases they released a little over  billion this all lowered loan volumes in credit card spending just like capital onecard member spending just comparing it to a year before covid  like i said  is not very useful for comparison here is one thing that i found really interesting spending on american express cards excluding travel and entertainment which people arent spending money on still for the most part was up  europe from  levels thats pretty impressive everything other than travel and entertainment was nicely higherunfortunately american express makes its money by selling cards based on travel and entertainment benefits i mean the key part with my american express platinum card is being able to use airport loungesmoser yeahfrankel their big credit card partnership is delta they have the deltabranded american express cards of course if you exclude travel and entertainment its going to look ok but thats a big piece of the puzzle i think that also spooked investors a little bit they did say that theyve seen an uptake on travel and entertainment spending in recent weeks thats promising but the fact that they had to back that out to even compare it with two years ago is not that impressive they came out and said that  theyre viewing it as a transition year theyre investing theyre trying to grow their core businessi mentioned i have the platinum card they did a really great job of pivoting to some nontravel benefits that people were able to use in covid times they did a store credit at home depot it was one of the big ones that i was able to use they did online credit at best buy online credit at goldbelly  which if you havent used goldbelly its where you order food from restaurants from all over the country to have it shipped to you they did credit for that for members which we used and was really fun theyve really done a great job of engaging their customers i dont know of any other major highend credit cards that have really pivoted their benefits like thatim still a fan of american express i may add to my position that was the first financial stock i ever bought almost  years agomoser lets wrap it up then with svb group because thats another one svb financial a company that is very popular in our foolish universe but im wondering maybe dont get quite as much play as some of the others what about svb financial stood out to youfrankel this is silicon valley bank is what svb stands for for those who arent familiar with the business as the name implies theyre based in silicon valley they loan a lot to tech businesses startups like that essentially consider them a bank and a venture capital firm in one is how i could describe it the markets been fantastic for things like that think of how the nasdaq has done over the past year its been a great year for the bank not terribly surprising the banks earnings exceeded expectations but what was surprising is that it was the best quarter in the banks history the bank earned over  a share for the quarter best ever the stock shot up  after earnings the return on equity was  standard for a bank is about  is what youre looking formoser yeahfrankel they grew their assets a banks assets might grow  in a year which would be considered a good year for a bank of america svbs assets grew  year over year total client funds grew  year over year thats a pretty impressive increase as the ceo says there are significant tailwinds at this point for even more growth  jasons dog just popped up you just missed him again  the ceo says that theres tailwinds for growth which makes people really optimistic this isnt just a onetime thingremember we mentioned last weekend a lot of the banks said some of the things that were just temporary like the higher trading revenue fueled by the volatility in the markets higher investment banking revenue fueled by ipos if investment activity in the tech sector is really here to stay and its going to ramp up for a while then its going to be a positive catalyst for this bankmoser well thats something to keep an eye on for sure as we continue on through earnings season and the rest of the year but matt i think for now that is going to wrap it up for us this week i really appreciate you not only taking the time to dig into those takeaways from berkshire hathaways meeting but also to dig into those earnings reports as earningspalooza rolls on i mean we just have so many companies announcing on a daily basis its nice to be able to jump in there and make some sense of it all so thanks againfrankel of course always fun to be heremoser well look forward to doing it again next week until then remember you can always reach out to
