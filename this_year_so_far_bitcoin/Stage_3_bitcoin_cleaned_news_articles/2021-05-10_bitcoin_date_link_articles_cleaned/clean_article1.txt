in this article ethcmjack taylor  getty imageslondon — ether the worlds secondlargest cryptocurrency has been stealing the limelight from bitcoin lately the digital coin hit a record high above  on monday and is now up more than  since the start of  that doesnt come close to the returns on memeinspired crypto dogecoin which is up over  yeartodate but many crypto investors dismiss dogecoin as little more than a joke and have compared its rise to the redditfueled trading frenzy that pumped up the prices of gamestop and other stocks here is a breakdown of what ether is and how its different from bitcoinhow it startedether is the native currency of ethereum an opensource blockchain platform ethereum was founded in  by russiancanadian programmer vitalik buterin and several other crypto entrepreneurs many of the people who started ethereum were previously involved in bitcoinfor buterin bitcoin was too limited in functionality in an interview with business insider he compared it to a pocket calculator that does one thing well whereas he said ethereum is more like a smartphone with multiple applications you can use thats the main premise of ethereum like bitcoin its built on blockchain technology — essentially a distributed computer network that records all cryptocurrency transactions but unlike bitcoin people can build apps on top of ethereum in buterins own words ethereum is a blockchain with a builtin programming language and the most logical way to actually build a platform that can be used for many more kinds of applicationssmart contractsthe ethereum network hosts whats known as smart contracts — collections of code that carry out a set of instructions and run on the blockchain these contracts are what power decentralized applications or dapps which are similar to smartphone apps that run on googles android or apples ios operating systems except they dont answer to one company or authority recently activity on ethers network has surged thanks to the rise of nfts or nonfungible tokens which are digital assets designed to represent ownership of unique virtual items thats because many nfts — from the colorful online cats of cryptokitties to the cyberpunkinspired avatars of cryptopunks — run on ethereumput simply bitcoin is a payments network that can be used to transfer value between two people anywhere in the world today its mainly used for investing ethereum on the other hand is aiming to create the infrastructure for an internet that isnt maintained by any single authority a big trend in ethereum right now is decentralized finance a term that refers to traditional financial products like loans and mortgages that are built using blockchain in this case blockchain replaces the middlemen — from banks to governments — and keeps track of everythingcriticismsethereum is far from perfect though in  the popularity of the game cryptokitties caused ethers network to become heavily congested slowing transactions significantly and leading the games developers to raise their fees scalability is one of the biggest issues with the ethereum network today it currently operates using a proofofwork protocol similar to bitcoin this means that cryptocurrency miners with purposebuilt computers have to compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to validate transactions this has led to criticisms of both bitcoin and ethereum from those who are worried about the massive amounts of energy consumed by their networks
