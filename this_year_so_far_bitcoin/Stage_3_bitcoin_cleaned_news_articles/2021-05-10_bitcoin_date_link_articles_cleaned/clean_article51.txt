to improve the efficiency of capital” said kazuya aihara who leads the firm’s digital asset grouphe added that the sharp increase in the value of cryptocurrencies over the past several months has been

participation of institutional investors and big corporations is still growing slowly although coincheck has enjoyed a surge in its number of users they are mostly individual investors the reluctance of institutional investors to get involved partly stems from a number of uncertainties such as those related to taxation and accounting and consequently big japanese investors appear to be taking a waitandsee approach“us and japanese institutional investors are quite different” said otsuka “major japanese institutional investors tend to seek stable returns the us has more investors such as hedge funds willing to take risks”photo gallery click to enlarge
