many pools that previously said they were committed to deploying taproot have yet to signalthe signaling period for bitcoin protocol upgrade taproot has begunthough the necessary consensus hasnt yet been reached in the first possible window supporters are expecting it to come in the next month which would still put the taproot deployment ahead of schedulethe privacyfocused modification will allow every use of the protocol to be encoded as a single public key and single signature which allows for other actions to be hidden inside seemingly ordinary code it also switches to the use of schnorr signatures which enable users to encode spending policies in individual public keys these changes will hopefully elevate privacy and efficiency developers and supporters saybut getting there has been a long road though taproot now has broad consensus conversations surrounding the upgrade have been in progress for years as of february bitcoin’s development community had established an activation timeline for the upgrade the upgrade merged into bitcoin core late last year and the node software allowing miners to signal support for the upgrade with hash power was released in marchnow miners have begun signalingninety percent of blocks have to signal for taproot during a twoweek period known as a difficulty epoch at the end of each epoch the bitcoin protocol adjusts upwards or downwards to accommodate how fast or slow blocks are being produced consensus for an upgrade must occur within the period before this adjustment in the case of taproot consensus must occur within  epochs or else developers will have to pursue a different activation strategy potentially a useractivated soft forkso far that hasn’t happened it’s very unlikely that enough mining pools will signal during this first difficulty epoch since only  of blocks are signaling at the moment on the mining pool side of things pools that collectively control  of the hash rate have started signalingbut many pools that previously said they were committed to deploying taproot have yet to signal alejandro de la torre vice president to mining pool poolin said the failure to activate in the early epoch is likely due to some inconvenient timingminers could start signaling on may  but that coincided with china’s may day celebration the holiday is observed from may  to may  in china meaning all the mining pools that had previously committed were essentially out of office on the first days of signaling they’re also five days behind on fixing any hiccups that could come with signalingand there have been hiccups for some de la torre said poolin has to upgrade firmware for some machines in its pool since the current firmware doesn’t allow signaling after upgrading the firmware it’ll then upgrade its nodes poolin at the time of publication was not signaling though it remains committed to doing so others could be experiencing similar problems which are easily fixable but take timeeven with roadblocks de la torre said he’s expecting the consensus to occur within the coming two difficulty epochs that would be at most a month from now putting the development community still a month ahead of its planned activation timeline of upgrading the majority by july the slow road to signaling doesn’t mean mining pools have changed their mind there’s no real contention with the software and sentiment remains positive according to de la torre“i don’t think it has anything to do with any change of sentiment” said de la torre “it would be really unwise in my opinion”
