a cryptocurrency mining farm in nadvoitsy russia andrey rudakovbloomberg via getty imagescryptocurrencies based on owning a large number of hard discs rather than using computer processors could offer a less energyintensive alternative to bitcoin and might even make it cheaper to build data centres – although one is already causing soaring demand for hard discs that is disrupting supply chainsbitcoin and several other popular cryptocurrencies are created or mined using a concept called proof of work which involves solving computationally difficult puzzles that consume a large amount of electricity bitcoin’s annual electricity consumption is estimated to be  terawatthours and rising or around the same amount as poland’s now rival currencies are emerging that instead make use of large numbers of empty hard discs a concept known as proof of spacebecause hard drives are less energyintensive to run than processors proofofspace currencies are touted as being more environmentally friendly however demand for one such currency chia has become so high that some asian countries such as vietnam are reporting shortages of hard discs the same phenomenon occurred with graphics cards which proved to be extremely efficient at mining certain proofofwork cryptocurrencies currently around  million terabytes of hard disc space are being devoted entirely to mining chia enough to store  billion moviesadvertisementjason feist at hard drive manufacturer seagate says the company is experiencing strong orders and that staff were working to “adjust to market demand”he also suggested that these new cryptocurrencies could provide a way for companies building large data centres to offset the cost by turning them over to mining “chia and similar technologies such as filecoin and sia show potential ways businesses can turn their idle infrastructure into ongoing revenue” says feistmichel rauchs at the university of cambridge says that while bitcoin’s proofofwork approach is well understood proofofspace alternatives are still in their infancyread more bitcoin mining emissions in china will hit  million tonnes by “other consensus algorithms that are less energyintensive but also introduce some level of centralisation and subjectivity might be an acceptable tradeoff there are always tradeoffs involved most of which tend to only become known over time” he saysaron peterson who works in digital production for the film industry in the uk says that people in his field started to notice the price of computing hardware creeping above manufacturerlisted prices around six years ago he puts it down to the demand for graphics cards by cryptocurrency miners“it was causing frustration among creatives and gamers who didn’t want to purchase upgrades at inflated prices just because other people were wasting huge amounts of electricity to compete for digital tokens” he saysafter deciding to try mining himself peterson found that it was using significant energy he also predicted that it would take five months before mining any coins “obviously i wasn’t going to run this experiment for five months especially if the estimated time continued to climb as new miners appeared” he sayspeterson isn’t convinced by chia’s green credentials saying bitcoin miners are unlikely to switch because it would require them to buy new hardware “instead of displacement it’s an additional crypto to be mined” he says“aside from the energy usage this results in mountains of electronic waste as hard drives will fail faster and more often” says peterson “the poorest people in the world already live with mountains of ewaste pollution we dump on them and this is just going to add to that”chia network the firm behind the cryptocurrency didn’t respond to a request for comment
