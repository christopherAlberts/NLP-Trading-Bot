bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that is used in digital form bitcoin is denoted by btc cryptocurrency is just like digital cash bitcoin was introduced by satoshi nakamoto the identity of this person is anonymous bitcoin was announced in  and was launched in  initially there was no value of bitcoin but with time its value increased its value is based mainly upon the users as it is based on their user activitybitcoin is a cryptocurrency that works in the form of blockchainsnow here are two words block and chain here the block is the place where the data is stored for instance the transaction is processed and all the information about the receiver sender and the amount of everything is saved in the blocknow everything has its limit and in the same way there is the limit of this block to store data and when the data gets stored then the new block forms and other blocks are formed in the same waynow the blocks are forming with the different information these get interlinked with each other by saving the last transaction of the respective previous block in this way the blocks are formed and the link is formed in all the blocks in this way the chain is being formed in the different blocks this is the process that is known to be blockchainbitcoin mining and minersnow as the transaction takes place there is a need to confirm the transaction and there is a significant risk if we allot this work to one person only as there are great chances of fraud with the transaction so as the system of the bitcoin is an open chain the transactions are computational and these require high computational support so there are thousands of people who are ready to provide their computers for this computational support these persons are known as minersnow the main job of miners is to solve the transaction as soon as possible and make it verify for this one transaction there are lots of miners present the transaction first enters the blockchain and then it gets decrypted as it is highly encrypted by cryptography the whole process works in this waynow there is no one who works for free in the same way these miners work and get rewarded a reward is in the form of bitcoin as the amount is being processed some amount of bitcoins is deducted from it and the part of it is given as a reward to the minervalue of bitcoin in the marketinitially when bitcoin was just launched it had no value but with time people started to understand that they should start investing in bitcoins as with time the demand for bitcoins increased which automatically led to the drastic increase in the number of bitcoins that gives people an idea about is bitcoin is real money or it’s a spambut the amount of bitcoin depends upon the demand in the market for instance if everyone starts to buy the bitcoins in high amounts and then they wait and let the price of bitcoins increase and they will sell these but the thing that happened was when they were buying the price of bitcoin drastically increased and when they stored it the price started to fall this is the main thing that decides the value of bitcoinas in the share market you just need to buy one share and pay the complete amount but this thing doesn’t take place in the case of bitcoins if you want to buy the bitcoins it is possible that you can buy bitcoins infraction for instance this is possible if you’re going to buy  btc but this is not true in the case of share marketslast wordsso here we come to the conclusion that bitcoin is the best way to invest in the form of digital cash as it is straightforward to use and work as peer to peer connection this can be transferred to any person whole over the world without taking any fear about the currency in which you are transferring even you can earn bitcoins by being a part of this and work as a miner
