the raspberry pi compute module   is known for its improved processing power and thanks to this new project from mirkoelectronics  its easier to apply that power to the world of cryptocurrency the development is known as the bitpirat—a custom carrier board created just for the the new custom pcb is designed to include modules and components suitable for the needs of a bitcoin node the best raspberry pi projects are flexible and according to mirkoelectronics this board can also function as a light computer or microserverimage  of  image credit mirkoelectronics image  of  image credit mirkoelectronicsthe bitpirat adds two usb ports an ethernet port one hdmi input and an  pcie slot for storage—critical for anyone looking to run a full bitcoin node it has a  power supply connector and  power rail that can deliver up to  of powerweve covered projects before that explain both how to mine bitcoin and create a bitcoin full node on the raspberry pi but this is one of the first dedicated  bitcoinfocused pcbs weve come across bitcoin mining thrives on gpu power but because this board is storagefocused it may be better suited for something like chia farmingcheck out the board design on hackaday for a closer look at the specs please also take note that this is an untested concept and work in progress be sure to follow mirkoelectronics for new iterations and future updates
