indmoney will be enabling customers to buy crypto assets using fiat currency like inr in foursix weeks said founder and ceo ashish kashyapinstead of directly buying cryptocurrencies users can invest through virtual holdings of these currencies that can be redeemed for cashcryptocurrency is clearly the flavour of the season with the rise of dogecoin epitomising just how quickly it has entered the mainstream even in india despite no clear cryptocurrency regulations interest around cryptocurrency such as ethereum dogecoin which is considered a meme crypto by most cardano ada and others has definitely piqued the interests of india’s fintech startups the latest to join the bandwagon is indmoney which has added fractional crypto investments with its techstars partnershipusing the inapp indcoins rewards indmoney users can invest in shares of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin ethereum dogecoin ripple cardano and uniswap founder and ceo ashish kashyap who announced the launch on his instagram feed told  “cryptocurrency is the asset of the future we feel that it will become an important element in diversification of investment for our customers and we have had many customers give us feedback about wanting to invest in crypto”kashyap said the initial goal is to deliver a simple experience for investors who may not be familiar with crypto investments the gurugrambased investment tech platform has enabled fractional virtual holdings through techstars a virtual exchange which facilitates trading in virtual fractional holdings of apple amazon google microsoft and other tech giants as well as cryptocurrenciesindmoney tests crypto watersfounded in  by ibibo cofounder ashish kashyap pratiksha dake and varun bhatia indmoney is a personal financial advisory agent which offers advice across asset classes loans and tax management it enables consumers to organise and track their wealth across investment avenues such as fixed deposits etfs mutual funds and morewhile the company has started with its proprietary indcoins for the crypto investments the plan is to broaden this to the extent that is allowed by any potential regulations for cryptocurrency“we will be enabling customers to buy crypto assets using fiat currency like inr this will be going live in foursix weeks we have taken a scalable approach with the indcoins which can be extended as we know more about the regulations” indmoney founder and ceo kashyap saidhe added that indmoney would also be adding a cryptocurrency wallet so customers can invest in real holdings and not just fractional virtual holdingsas the company explains a virtual holding is “a representation of a parallel value of a holding it is not part of the real holding a virtual holding then is essentially a method for calculating a value that is granted in the form of indcoins” it adds that a fractional virtual holding is just a portion of this holdingin the case of indmoney redemption of the investments is possible but it does seem a lot more complicated than it should be if the goal is to familiarise its user base with cryptocurrency users need to sell their virtual holdings on techstars to get indcoins in their indmoney account alternatively they can get cash in their accounts by transferring the virtual holdings to a friend who has to then claim those virtual holdings another option is the real monetary value of the indcoins would be credited to the user’s bank account presently the value for redemption on techstars is  indcoins is equal to inr cryptocurrency gains mainstream limelight in indiathe foray into crypto indmoney’s kashyap highlighted was prompted by customer feedback across channels “our goal is to cocreate with customers when we read all the feedback on our app store and other channels we saw users need a onestop shop for all investments”while some have derided these fractional holding models as not being real cryptocurrency investments they have massively increased the addressable base by making it easy and affordable for indians to invest — even though there are several challenges still to overcomefor example coinswitch kuber claims to have over  mn users in india and is targeting to cross  mn users by the end of  on the back of mainstream promotions it crossed  bn in transaction volume in february  in the growing indian crypto market coinswitch competes with several other homegrown exchanges such as wazirx coindcx unocoin and zebpay among othersgiven that cryptocurrency is currently a selfregulated market ie no overarching regulations from rbi or sebi there are a variety of models at play fractional investments in cryptocurrency is essentially what coinswitch kuber coindcx wazirx and other exchanges in india offer crypto investors can buy up to  of a virtual holding up to the eighth decimal investors are allowed to ‘withdraw’ these investments to external crypto wallets for a fee which is usually quite steepessentially fractional investments are used for trading between cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrencybased fixed deposits and loans as in the case of bengalurubased vauld formerly known as bank of hodlersother investment tech and fintech platforms are also exploring cryptocurrency as an investment class or a way to drive activity fintech company cred partnered with wazirx last month to offer bitcoin as a reward as part of a promotional campaign with the crypto industry hopeful of regulations will widespread adoption of crypto be the key to finally bringing it to the mainstream and out of the shadowswill crypto regulations come at the right timeindmoney’s kashyap strongly believes that regulations will come in for crypto just as it has for all investment asset classes while he did not speculate on how the regulations will play out he was confident that the industry will grow on the back of these rules and there will be opportunities for indmoney to partner with dedicated crypto platforms tooin recent weeks indian cryptocurrency exchanges have alleged that payment gateways are blocking their transactions on instructions from some of the country’s leading banks “confusion in india’s banking industry is hurting  cr indians in crypto” nischal shetty cofounder and ceo of mumbaibased cryptocurrency exchange wazirx wrote on twitter earlier this weekkashyap believes that the current roadblocks will be cleared for all kinds of crypto operations in due time it will pave the way for more innovation around cryptocurrencies he saidwhile in  the reserve bank had barred banks from providing services for cryptocurrency trading and to crypto companies this was overturned by the supreme court in march  the sc had called the rbi bar as ‘unconstitutional’ but one year later banks are still wary of providing financial services to crypto exchanges at the same time the national payments corporation of india npci the umbrella body for retail and digital payments has refused to block fund movements for cryptocurrency trades and has left it to each bank’s risk and compliance team to take the call naturally confusion abounds for the crypto industry“ideally it would help the industry if rbi could give some clarification as currently banks are not willing to provide access to the crypto industry due to confusion about whether they’re allowed to service the industry or not if the rbi could clarify its stand to all the banks under it then that would tremendously help this fastgrowing sector in india” wazirx’s shetty told  earlier this weeklobbying efforts from the industry continue to call for regulation so that crypto companies can go about scaling up their businesses and driving economic value indiatechorg — an industry association representing india’s consumer internet startups unicorns and investors — has proposed a fivepoint recommendation on boosting india’s cryptocurrency economy potential to  government departments such as the income tax department ministry of corporate affairs and other bodies including the reserve bank of indiathe proposals have been made to bring in more clarity over various aspects related to cryptocurrency investments taxation transaction
