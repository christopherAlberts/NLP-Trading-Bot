satoshi nakamoto and i have something in commonhe has just been commended in the louisiana legislature as i was in  there the resemblance ends he made history by inventing bitcoin i was just a humble member of that years large class of inductees at the louisiana political hall of fame in winnfieldmy one advantage over nakamoto is that i exist and he does notnakamoto is a pseudonym for an inventor or inventors whose worth in any currency fiat or crypto runs into the billions theyve got me there i received the nod in baton rouge under my real name but never accumulated enough moola of the folding kind let alone the digitalthe house of representatives quickly adopted a resolution authored by state rep mark wright rcovington which not only commemorates the ascent of bitcoin but urges state and local government to adopt this “new technology” in particular a cryptocurrency developed in louisiana called moxey the resolution reads very much like an advertisement asserting that cryptocurrencies provide access to new capital and customers as well as “new tools for employee bonuses and compensation” while facilitating “peertopeer transactions in a secure manner”while the louisiana house believes bitcoin could “replace gold as a monetary reserve” warren buffett takes a different view buffett whose pronouncements are generally on the money has described cryptocurrencies as a “mirage” and “rat poison squared”the house has now unanimously passed a bill also authored by wright that runs to  pages and provides a detailed exposition of a “financial technology regulatory sandbox program” the object is to leave the likes of moxey largely free from government regulation while they refine the “blockchain technology” that sustains cryptocurrenciesthe bill passed so easily that we can only conclude legislators had no trouble grasping that technology i will therefore not insult your intelligence by explaining itthe rapid rise of cryptocurrencies has made early investors very rich but doubters invoke the south sea bubble of the  century and the tulip craze of the  to warn of impending disaster euphoria rules right now though when the cryptocurrency trader coinbase went public last month its value reached  billion before falling backthat sure sounds like madness but if wright is right louisiana stands to prosper mightily by embracing cryptomoney a mere  years after bitcoin was inventedthere have been so many reports of instant millionaires that cryptocurrencies have received the most attention as an investment medium but they have lately been catching on as a means of exchange elon musk is a big fan of cryptocurrencies for both purposes you can buy a tesla with it and musk owns  billion worth of bitcoin the oakland as are taking dogecoin for game ticketsbut buffett is hardly alone in fearing it will all end in tears bill gates and treasurer secretary janet yellen are among the naysayerscryptocurrencies being by definition safe from prying eyes have an obvious appeal for criminals but if you failed to get in early the boom may have passed you byfor those of us who missed the chance of easy riches the consolation is that at least we are not destroying the wetlands through the global warming driven by cryptocurrency algorithms that gobble more energy than many a countryemail james gill at
