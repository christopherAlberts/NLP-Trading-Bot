if you’re a canadian investor then it’s likely you have a taxfree savings account tfsa while the tfsa is great this year there is a total contribution room of  now if you’re interested in buying bitcoin you have a problem bitcoin currently trades at around  as of writing so even if you haven’t invested a penny into your tfsa it means you can only put one solitary bitcoin in your tfsa maybe it’s time to look at the bigger picture of cryptocurrencylet’s say you don’t have  lying around but you want to get in on the cryptocurrency action i don’t blame you luckily there are other ways to invest in bitcoin and cryptocurrency that won’t cost thousands in fact you can keep it all under  per sharethe bitcoin etfcanada now has several exchangetraded funds etf exclusively focused on bitcoin the first official one was purpose bitcoin etf tsxbtccb it invests  into bitcoin using funds from investors to buy up bitcoin and then etf investors get a share so basically it’s like investing in bitcoin for a fraction of the price as you can see the stock has performed almost exactly like bitcoin since coming on the marketas of writing purpose etf has about  billion worth of bitcoin on hand shares in the etf are up  since coming on the market this year if you’re one to believe that bitcoin not only has a future but one that’s set to skyrocket then purpose is exactly what you want right now you can pick up shares for about should you invest in hive blockchain right now click here to learn morebigger than bitcoindogecoin has been exploding this year though not by share price let’s do another sidebyside comparison to bitcoin while bitcoin is currently up  in the last year dogecoin is up an insane  in the last year that growth of course needs to be taken into context while bitcoin has been trading in the tens of thousands dogecoin went from  per share to  per share yes you could have made millions but that would have been a rare occurrencethe question is can you still make millions the cryptocurrency which started out as a joke is just like any other cryptocurrency stock the entire market is volatile so you’re likely to see massive fluctuation from this investment that’s especially since a onecent move could be a huge dent if you invest enough to make millions so this isn’t my favourite but at  per share it’s absolutely affordable to take a small stakehive stockthis is by far my favourite investment whether you’re interested in dogecoin bitcoin ethereum or any other cryptocurrency hive blockchain technologies tsxvhive is what you’ll need the company invests in climatecontrolled data centres to mine and sell cryptocurrency it continues to grow through acquisition and is an actual business not a currencywhat this means is its performance is actually dependent on revenue most recently that revenue increased to  million up from  million the same time last year and the stock keeps on rising as of writing shares in hive stock trade at  per share and are up  in the last year lone so here you get the middle ground in performance between the craziness of dogecoin and stability of purposebottom linecryptocurrency remains an area of investment with lots of volatility while all three of these stocks trade under  per share if you’re going to consider one i would go with hive stock the others are too dependent on the performance of an individual currency hive stock however just depends on whether cryptocurrency will be around years from now if today is any indicator it looks like a likely future
