the flip side of nfts a glimpse into the artists unique perspectivesthe incredible momentum of the nascent nonfungible token nft market has attracted significant attention from collectors and investors alike still one group that is notably benefiting from this paradigm shift is the artists behind these creative worksnew era for art emerges as a net positive for creatorsover the last few months much of the attention drawn to nfts have been a function of soaring valuations for digital art and collectibles that seemingly set new records every week enthusiasts needn’t look any further than the appearance of multiple exchange platforms niches and new mediums that nfts are pioneering to recognize the inherent value proposition of this fresh standardwhile auction results are certainly a fascinating interest story the advantage for artists who are largely overlooked is even more compelling yet the artist’s point of view has largely been absent from the nft discussion and debate despite playing a central role in this budding movementinstead of recognizing this advantage many critics focus on the drawbacks like the environmental impact of platforms like ethereum with hic et nunc a tezosbased nft marketplace that stands for “here and now” overcoming these critiques the perspective can be shifted back to the platform’s art contributors like nancy baker cahill greg yüna and ben clarkson each of them harbors exciting views on the status and outlook for nftsnfts as a source of empowerment and expanded opportunitiesmany creators see this new archetype as a means to push the boundaries of art even further in a supportive community environment and luxury jewelry designer greg yüna echoes this notionaccording to yünajewelry has been one way for me to bring to life a creative vision but i’ve also always sought out opportunities to take that and express it elsewhere…it’s great that now people are really understanding that digital art can be the product itself not just marketing for something else it takes a lot of time to create that work of art and it’s liberating for us as artists for that work to be valued as well i’m really hyped to be a part of this community that supports artists and appreciates the work we donot a passing fadoften finding themselves at the bottom of the food chain nfts are a surprisingly empowering development for the creative community and according to the artists not just a flash in the pan for californiabased multidisciplinary artist nancy baker cahill nfts are a driving force in redistributing the power hierarchy of art which makes them all the more attractiveper baker cahillfor far too long artists have been denied the kind of economic accountability guaranteed to practitioners in other industries the ontological questions blockchain prompts are equally appealing and provide creative fertile ground in which ideas will continue to grow and develop…i see the hyperbolic profits as a passing fad but not the art form itself or the idea of digital artwork with value – even value equal to a physical artworkyüna echoes this notion statingi don’t see it as a fad at all nfts allow us to expand our ecosystem of work change traditional commerce and connect with a new community that wants to support that work i think more consumers will follow suit as nfts become more commonplace but i’m excited to get into this now because who doesn’t want to be in the company of first adopters the people that are buying my art are the real visionaries herefor an artist illustrator animator and twotime finalist for the lumen prize ben clarkson the social element is crucial for nfts’ staying power he addsi think nfts are here to stay in one form or another what the specific economics or underlying technology are will probably continue to be in flux for awhile yet technologies are always forms of social communication what changes are the social relationsa participation shakeupnot all art forms traditionally had marketplaces that would allow creators to monetize their works while delivering greater accessibility and awareness for clarkson nfts are inviting more widespread participation in this new market and helping artists push the limits of the digital realm as they experiment with this new mediumwhen addressing the stark contrast between physical and digital art clarkson remarksin the  robert rauschenberg attached a chair to one of his paintings making it a sculpture you can’t do that with an nft there are material qualities to mediums that dictate what you can communicate with them nfts have their own set of material qualities there hasn’t been a market in the past for fine art animation and now with nfts it is thriving as people experiment with the form there will be new possibilitiesbaker cahill views nfts and physical works as symbiotic instead of opposed and more of a bridge between the two realmsi wouldn’t want to frame them as antipodal especially because nfts can also back physical works of artthe evolving creative processjust like the platform and mediums are changing the creative process accompanying nfts is also in flux for clarkson it is more of a straightforward answeri think ‘how can i get this under ’yüna expounds on this idea even furtherthe process is definitely different since you can’t wear an nft on your body at least not yet…when i make a piece for a person it’s got to have a part of their character in it so i’m not approaching this like i would when creating a piece for say floyd mayweather to wear in the prefight show or michael b jordan for the next creed premier this is turning my own collection and turning the jewelry into an artistic composition when i’m creating with rachel we take the materials that we would use in our jewelry and transform them into digital works of artstill for cahill baker the process isn’t so strikingly different and applies the same systems she already employsin my case i am as intentional about the artwork and its conceptual undergirding as i am in my physical works this applies even to the artworks i choose to mint – how do they reflect my practice and my goals as an artistthe outlook according to the artists themselvesjust as the artists embrace this new format for their creative works they are also looking towards the future as they brainstorm for the next frontier of art for some this means experimentation for others a chance to shine a spotlight on pressing issues and other still a chance to dream up something brand newaccording to yünarachel and i have been experimenting with new ways to look at luxury jewelry and reimagining how people see luxury jewelry for awhile so when this opportunity came we had to go big naturally we looked at some of the greatest works of art in history and decided we could have some fun recreating those with timepieces tennis chains loose diamonds cuban links rings and precious gemstones it wasn’t easy—trying to do gustav klimt and piet mondrian right is a tall order but we did itin terms of her upcoming projects baker cahill chooses to hone in on an undertaking that features a unique combination of stakeholdersi’m super excited about an ambitious project for which i am collaborating with a knowledgeable art lawyer in the nft space a prominent pos blockchain an art platform that supports ecofriendly cryptocurrency and an art museum together we are presenting a multipart artwork which boldly addresses a series of urgent issues we are collectively concerned about at this moment in timefor clarkson brainstorming is the order of the dayi’m trying to figure out what i produce next i fill books with ideas then dream about ways that i can flesh them out i am currently thinking about animating an animeinspired shootout but everyone has a bananaare you considering buying a piece of art nft let us know in the comments section belowimage credits shutterstock pixabay wiki commons greg
