the best investor in the world wants you to buy index funds ok mr buffett i will but which indexes largecap smallcap growth value the us internationalbitcoin is “disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization” — charlie munger vicechairman of berkshire hathawaywhen i was  years old i bought shares of the stop  shop supermarket company that grocery chain is now part of the ahold delhaize conglomerate being the kid i was i held it only long enough to make the money i needed to buy the computer and the mountain bike i wanted stop  shop wasn’t the only stock i considered i remember ruling out berkshire hathaway because i didn’t have the  to buy one single share maybe i should have split more wood or sold more lemonade and tried to make enough money to buy a share because i missed out on an opportunity on may   berkshire hathaway held its annual meeting at the time a single share was trading above despite that mistake i still pay attention to the company’s annual shareholder meetings in part for the unfiltered commentary this year did not disappoint regarding bitcoin vice chairman charlie munger expressed “i don’t welcome a currency that’s so useful to kidnappers and extortionists” warren buffett ceo of the company took a swing at the trading platform robinhood buffett claimed that robinhood has “become a very significant part of the casino group” munger swung harder calling them “deeply wrong”in addition to the controversial comments i also tune in for the investment advice buffett is often considered the most successful investor ever known when he gives advice you kinda oughta pay attention here is a transcript of the meeting for you to dig deeper into all of those pearls of wisdombuffett the world’s best investor says the best way to invest is in index mutual funds upon his death  percent of his thenwidow’s funds will go into an sp  index fund and  percent will go into treasury billshe pointed out that if you looked at the  biggest stocks in  none of them are on that list today he said if we were asked in  how many of those companies would still be the biggest today very few if any of us would say zero “it is a reminder of what extraordinary things are going to happen” he said “we were just as sure of ourselves as investors and wall street in  as we are today but the world can change in very very dramatic ways … it’s a great argument for index funds”the best investor in the world wants you to buy index funds ok mr buffett i willbut which indexes largecap smallcap growth value the us internationalwhen buffett advises investing in index funds he primarily refers to the sp  index that’s a focus on largecap us stocks generally over the long term the sp  is agnostic to the growth versus value debate i consider a largecap blend index whether tied to the sp  or the dow jones industrial average a k a the dow my home base however i am apparently more riskaverse than buffett as i tend to be more diversified than just holding the sp  indexi don’t rely upon a static allocation i think it’s a mistake to hold something just because the textbooks say you should the vanguard group is in my opinion the king of longterm investing in index funds vanguard tells us that “to get the full diversification benefits we recommend that you consider investing about  percent of your stock allocation in international stocks and about  percent of your bond allocation in international bonds”i won’t refute the merits of vanguard’s recommendations over the long run but for example i’ve purposely avoided holding foreignbased stocks for years on november   i sent our trading rationale to clients explaining why we shifted our allocation from the msci eafe index europe australia and the far east to the sp  index if you’d like to read that internal memo send me an email i’ve dabbled in some emerging markets trades since then but i’ve generally avoided international investments for those sixplus years that was technically a risky move on my part because i became less diversified i feel that sometimes it makes sense to avoid specific sectors market capitalizations or regionssimilarly sometimes i think it makes sense to discreetly allocate more funds to one area over another for example i’ve been more a fan of growth stocks than value stocks on april   i shared with readers that “i shifted some largecap growth broadly and technology stocks specifically into largecap value stocks” i am in no hurry but i expect that i’ll rotate more of my holdings from growth into value over timei’ve covered many reasons i remain bullish on the us equity market even if a  percent plus correction is overdue my bullish inclination remains although i have also pointed out some valuation metrics that contend that the us stock market is approaching — if not in — bubble territory the most elevated valuations exist within the growth sectors of the market which could limit returns and leave equity prices vulnerable to more significant pullbacks because of those elevated valuations i am exploring a shift from growth to valueyou may wonder why i have not made a more significant move well when i sold out of the eafe index in favor of the sp  index i did so because i thought it would be a longterm trade i am not particularly eager to execute a trade unless we’re looking at holding something for at least a year preferably a decade if timed well making a quick move from growth to value could pay off however i am by no means a savvy trader according to dalbar’s  qaib report quantitative analysis of investor behavior trying to time the market was a primary culprit as to why the average equity fund investor returned nearly onethird less than the sp  index over    and  yearspeople like to tell themselves they’re the exception to the rule that they’re special i’m just smart enough to know that i’m not smart enough to be special i don’t want to overconfidently try and time a shortterm move during the last month i have become more confident that rotating from growth stocks may make sense maybe not yet to value stocks but perhaps to something more neutralregarding making a more considerable shift to value stocks as opposed to something more neutral i’m sure i will do so at some point i want to be more confident that it’s the start of a longterm phenomenon when i do i don’t have to be first to be correct i can let others take the risk of being early and if it ends up being a longterm trend then i can benefit from the duration of that trendthe debate about growth vs value is more subtle than you might expect i don’t believe you should discuss the rotation of growth to value without considering cyclical stocks vs noncyclical stocks companies of cyclical stocks sell more of their goods and services when the economy is doing well the prices of cyclical stocks tend to follow economic growthnoncyclical companies sell nondurable necessities noncyclical stocks tend to fall into the category of value stocks cyclicals however could be value companies like financials or growth companies like technology i like the outlook for cyclical stocks if you think cyclical stocks will perform well that means both value stocks financial and growth stocks technology could do wellcyclical stocks tend to outperform noncyclicals when the profit cycle accelerates earnings reports for the first quarter of  have been overwhelmingly positive companies are beating on both the top and bottom lines and some are increasing guidance the atlanta fed gdpnow tool is currently tracking gross domestic product growth for this quarter to be twice that of last quarter i believe the positive economic and earnings outlook will support cyclicals which includes both growth and value stocks i continue to have more of a progrowth stance but i know that it’s only temporary the stock market tends to sniff out inflection points although the economic and earnings data are in boom territory i need to watch them closely it is near the time to flatten out my growth allocationstarting in late march of  the market saw its biggest gains from the “stayathome” stocks then the leadership became the more traditional postrecession earlyleadership type of names lowerquality companies with higher leverage we could soon see another leadership handoff so that midtolate cycle stocks namely the cyclicals with good cash flow and lower leverage could be the next winnersi don’t have a significant concern that the growth stocks which led in the second half of  will blow up in the second half of  but a healthy rotation for the overall market means there would be a shift in leadership making my growth vs value allocation more neutral isn’t about chasing performance it’s about reducing risk by
