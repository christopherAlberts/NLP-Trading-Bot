century city calif â€” as the cryptocurrency bitcoin gains more mainstream attention longtime investor and bitcoin miner brad yasar is often asked what exactly is bitcoin miningi put on my hard hat and grab a pick and shovel and go to work yasar said jokingly no basically youre the accountant for the bitcoin blockchain networkwhat you need to know bitcoin mining is the process of verifying blocks of bitcoin payments and adding those transactions to a massive public ledgerthe mining operation looks like a data center where the computers do the verification work autonomouslycritics of bitcoin say its a massive speculationdriven bubblethere is also a concern about energy consumptionbitcoin mining is the process of verifying blocks of bitcoin payments and adding those transactions to a massive public ledgeryasar was recently in his home country of turkey which took steps to try to ban bitcoin before reversing course he lives in los angeles most of the time but travels the world educating people about bitcoin and has a mining operation in canada consisting of about  computerswhen i first started mining i could mine a lot of bitcoins on a simple pc computer yasar said now you need thousands of computers to verify one blockthe mining operation looks like a data center people dont sit behind the computers instead the computers do the verification work autonomously and are programmed to solve increasingly difficult cryptographic puzzles to verify transactionsyasar explained how the puzzles generated by the bitcoin software are extremely difficult to solve using lots of computing power pooled together miners also compete against each other to solve the puzzles because the reward is a certain number of new bitcoinsit would probably take a person millions and millions of years to solve one puzzle yasar saidonce a mining computer solves the cryptographic puzzle its easy for the bitcoin network to verify the answer and approve that block of transactions to be added to the shared ledger there has to be consensus from the network which provides the decentralization of bitcoinhow can a puzzle be extremely difficult to solve but extremely easy to verify the answer think of the cryptographic puzzle as trying to find the code of a lock there are no shortcuts possible when trying to find the code that unlocks it you have to try every possible combination until at some point you find the correct one by chanceonce you find the code its easy to verify that the combination was correct because the lock is now open thats essentially how bitcoin mining worksand the pseudonymous programmer satoshi nakamoto who invented bitcoin wanted to ensure the supply can be capped to prevent inflation he created digital scarcity there will only ever be  million bitcoins and the last one is expected to be mined somewhere around something that cant be overproduced or suffer a supply expansion is more devaluationproof do you know how much the us dollar in your pocket has been devalued in the last five to ten years do we even think about it yasar saidcritics of bitcoin say its a massive speculationdriven bubble one that could never overtake or substitute fiat also known as government money and there is also a concern about energy consumption as usc economics professor dr larry harris explainedmy understanding is theyre consuming about threetenths of a percent of all electricity produced in the entire world harris said so that cost has to be borne by the people using bitcoin and that makes bitcoin very expensive there are a lot of losers in bitcoina bill introduced in the new york state senate is even seeking to halt bitcoin mining for three years until the state has assessed its impact on the environmentyasar noted that hes concerned about energy consumption as well but feels the technology shouldnt be singled outim supportive of all those conversations he said i think where i may differ in opinion and approach is lets look at other industries and other activities that are consuming industrial level and scales of electricity and energy and see if we can have a global and acrossboard approach as opposed to saying bitcoin is horrible for humanity and should be destroyedyasar added that he supports green energy sources for mining which are actually more profitable for the miners this is because the lower the cost of energy the more profit they make when generating new bitcoinsbut more importantly yasar feels bitcoin presents the opportunity for a more sustainable financial network one that he sees as an opensource alternative to a monopoly global monetary system run by banks and politicians he doesnt necessarily trust to preserve the value of his money
