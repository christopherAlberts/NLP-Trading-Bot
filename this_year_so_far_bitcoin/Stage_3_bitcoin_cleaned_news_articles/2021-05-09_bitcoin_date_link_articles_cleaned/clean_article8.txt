asked  experts which crypto theyd rather hold for the next  years and whysign up here for our daily newsletter  things before the opening bellbitcoin has long been the dominant cryptocurrency but recently ethereums native token ether has emerged as more than just a clear number twoin  ether has made gains on bitcoin in terms of market cap and investors are taking notewhile the two cryptocurrencies are very different in terms of their architecture and use cases both are top options for cryptocurrency investors longtermwith that in mind insider decided to reach out to the experts to see which cryptocurrency they believe offers the most upside over the long haulwe asked crypto industry ceos analysts cofounders and more which asset theyd rather hold for the next ten years and whyheres what they had to saybitcoin bulls we are strong believers in both bitcoin and ethereum that being said if we absolutely have to choose we would prefer holding bitcoin over ethereum for the next few years while ethereum leads in terms of innovation and current use cases bitcoin leads in terms of security and proven track record most importantly we believe its a great store of value and has all the properties of a reserve asset  peter wall ceo of argo blockchain bitcoin will be as transformative for money as the internet was for information by  bitcoins market cap will overtake golds market cap demonstrating that it is the best storeofvalue asset for a digitalfirst world but it doesnt stop at storeofvalue bitcoin is both a decentralized monetary settlement network and a digitally scarce asset today ethereum powers most of the defi decentralized finance platforms but in the near future well be able to build defi platforms on top of bitcoin thanks to layer  solutions eventually bitcoin will become both the global standard of value and the monetary settlement layer of the world for these reasons i have put most of my liquid assets into bitcoin not ethereum  jason yanowitz cofounder of blockworks bitcoin is strengthening its position as a store of value and the narratives around btc as hedge against potential inflation and potential replacement for gold is becoming more clear with all the big firms entering the space with multiple financial institutions starting to hold btc on their balance sheet there is more upside and price will be driven mostly by increased participation in the ecosystem  ken nakamura ceo of gmozcom trust company to me its a nobrainer bitcoin is the name brand everyone knows and has proven its staying power ethereum is the new kid on the block and challenger eth has been sold as having mystical practical applications but in reality its inefficient struggles to operate at scale and is not a hedge against inflation  jamie finn president  cofounder of securitizeread more fundstrats head of digital assets research walks us through his  and  yearend price targets for bitcoin and ether  and shares the  tokens hes bullish onethereum holders i do believe the potential upside on ethereum tends to be a bit greater from its utility functionality and ecosystem voyagers customers who own both bitcoin and ethereum have shifted their cryptocurrency allocations in the past few months to increase their ethereum holdings on which they can earn  interest apr were also seeing our larger investors more comfortable taking on ethereums risk and reward profile the ethereum blockchain powers the most established ecosystem for decentralized finance utility tokens and nfts all of which are gaining mainstream traction ethereum will also be soon undergoing an upgrade that will accelerate the speed of eth transactions reduce transaction fees and restrict its circulating supply  steve ehrlich ceo and founder of cryptoasset broker voyager digital the technological advantage and utility of ethereum blockchain is far greater than that of bitcoin and i think investors are noticing that as well there are over  billion currently locked in defi projects on the ethereum blockchain and only  days ago it was  billion for those that believe in the demand of defi for services like lending borrowing trading insurance monetary issuance they should be paying more attention to the ethereum blockchain its a network that supports smart contracts…they alone carry limitless potential and should be enough for ethereum to have a competitive advantage over bitcoin and its applications in our everyday lives im in the ethereum camp  tally greenberg head of business development at allnodes institutional investor recognition of eth as a real and valuable asset has been longawaited and anticipated i foresee the current trend of ethereums price increase gaining more momentum leading to a shift in capital flowing into ethereum  as investors become educated on what ethereum is and how the technology is going to shape the future…technicals and fundamentals show there is greater long term upside potential for eth than btc…most banks institutions and investment funds have mandated investments towards clean environmentally sustainable industries and technologies concerns on how and where the majority of bitcoin is mined today could negatively impact the assets price long term…ethereums upcoming network upgrades  and proofofstake will make eth a deflationary asset while providing a reduction in gas fees and reducing the total supply ethereum when these two shifts occur they could push ethereum over the  market cap whether ethereums network changes ignite a supercycle or not the asset undoubtedly has  more developers more onchain activity and exponentially more active use cases than any other chain  megan kaspar managing director of magnetic i think bitcoin will always have some level of acceptance being the flagship crypto and a perceived store of value within the space however the blockchain technology of ethereum having more applicability and functionality including recent smart contracts for nfts makes it potentially more of an attractive longerterm play also the current price disparity between the two might make ethereum seem more affordable to the average investor as well  ed egilinsky managing director  head of alternative investments at direxionwhy not both the world can be broadly split into traders and investors traders focus on shortterm price movements and arbitrage opportunities and rightly are excited by bitcoin versus ethereum relative movements right now investors focus on what the future will be like what are the tailwinds driving projects forward and how value will be captured by some and lost by others for investors both bitcoin and ethereum need to be in your portfolio right now…bitcoin has a chance of remaining the leading crypto asset in the world while ethereum has a chance of remaining the leading distributed software development platform in the world both positions of leadership would capture trillions of dollars of value in ten years time so invest in both now  matthew le merle chairman of blockchain coinvestors bitcoins market cap as of last week has fallen below  of the crypto market for the first time since  and is down over  overall since january in our work with large institutions were seeing increased demand for bitcoin and ethereum as well as alternative coins we believe institutional investors and corporate treasuries will hold onto both btc and eth assets as their adoption and the market matures  raghu yarlagadda ceo of falconx
