you might have noticed some green squares floating around twitter like the laser eyes they are part of the insider signaling that creates a sense of cause and belonging unlike the laser eyes they are not directly about the price – they signal support for the proposed taproot upgrade for the bitcoin networkwhy is this important it’s not just the benefits the upgrade brings which are significant taproot is important because it reminds us of what bitcoin isyou’re reading crypto long  short a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets authored by coindesk’s head of research noelle acheson it goes out every sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view you can subscribe herethe good stuffbefore we dive into why this matters let’s look at some of the main benefits of the proposed upgradeincreased privacy this does not refer to bitcoin addresses or enhanced anonymity it refers to types of transactions taproot will make complex transactions such as those requiring multiple signatures or those with delayed release indistinguishable from simple transactions in terms of onchain footprint lower fees the data size of complex bitcoin transactions will be reduced which will lead to lower transaction costs more flexibility a new type of signature will enhance smart contract functionality in bitcoin making it easier and cheaper for users to set more complicated conditions for a transaction lightning boost taproot will make transactions on the lightning network cheaper more flexible and more private the lightning network is a layer  solution that enables faster and more scalable payments that periodically anchor in aggregate form to the bitcoin blockchain offering eventual bitcoin security while amplifying speed and potential throughputa meaningful stepwith all of the above taproot is the most significant upgrade to the bitcoin network since the block size increase of  the relative infrequency of bitcoin upgrades highlights one of its main features it is robustmaking any amendments to bitcoin is hard there is no one “in charge” who can decide what changes get pushed through and achieving consensus among such a diverse and dispersed group of participants is a challenge to say the least that taproot is more or less unanimously supported highlights what a big deal this upgrade iswhat has turned out to be contentious however is the method of the upgrade in march a compromise was reached in the form of a “speedy trial” which gives miners a series of twoweek blocks in which to signal support for taprootthis kicked off last saturday with the most recent difficulty adjustment from that moment bitcoin miners had until the next difficulty adjustment two weeks later to signal support for the taproot upgrade in their mined blocks if  of processed blocks signaled support the upgrade would get “locked in” for activation in novemberon tuesday however it became apparent this signaling round wasn’t going to be successful with almost  of the window’s blocks processed by around midday  had not signaled support so the  threshold was out of reachthis is not a big deal – rather than rejection of the idea it’s more likely that miners hadn’t yet gotten their heads or their software tweaks around the necessary steps the next twoweek window of signaling opportunity is coming up and if that is also unsuccessful the network tries again and so on until aug  if by that date  signaling has not been achieved taproot goes back to the drawing boardthe real benefitso the taproot upgrade will boost bitcoin’s functionality and potentially broaden its market that’s good for its prospects and its valuationbut here’s the most important impact for the investing market overall it reminds us that bitcoin is a technologymany investors see bitcoin as a store of value others are drawn in by the volatility most tend to overlook one of the bitcoin system’s most defining features – it is a relatively new technology with all the upside that implieswhen you buy gold you don’t wonder how it will evolve while in the vault bitcoin on the other hand does evolve it did so in  and it will most likely do so again this year“technology” implies risk though – things can go wrong code has bugs andor unintended consequences that’s why it is key that bitcoin’s upgrades are few and far between because they need to be carefully vetted and tested also because there is no central body to decide on bitcoin upgrades they need to be agreed upon by all the key stakeholders consensus is always extremely difficult to achievethis is a good thing there’s over  trillion of market value riding on the bitcoin network now not to mention the valuation of all of the businesses built to support the network so the risk needs to be minimized to an almost negligible leveltaproot drives home that bitcoin may be an excellent store of value and it may provide good returns for speculators – but the cryptocurrency also represents the opportunity to get in early on a transformative technology investment it’s like being able to take an early stake in a hot startup but with much more liquidity and less paperworkso taproot will not only improve bitcoin’s usability which could have the effect of broadening its market and therefore potentially its value as well it also reminds us of one of bitcoin’s core characteristics which seems to have gotten drowned out in the prevailing marketdriven narratives of late bitcoin is still a new technology and its potential upside comes from more than its supply schedule its inflation resistance and its decentralizationdogecoin is getting people worriedyou may be sick of hearing about it but we can’t not talk about dogecoin this week it does feel like the sentiment has morphed from “hee hee this is fun” to “oh no we’re going to get into trouble” it’s like having a party at your parents’ house when they’re away for the weekend only to have it spin totally out of controlthe dogecoin concern is not unfounded a price increase of over  so far this year on objectively poor fundamentals concentration of ownership relatively weak security and narrow fully synced node distribution for starters is fine until someone gets hurtwhen if that happens will the outofpocket investors cry foul and demand intervention if so will the intervention materializewhat could the regulators do insist that investors only invest in things with solid fundamentals such ascould they insist that even more warnings be sprinkled about what would these warnings say and would they just be on dogecoin if so why if not would people even listeni suppose the authorities could publicly speak out against such speculation oh wait – they did thatthis is the regulators’ dilemma they have to protect the investor but they also have to encourage markets and innovation how can they do both in a market fueled by sentiment do they restrict the sentiment or the market how would they go about doing either effectivelypart of the intensification of the attention frenzy is the appearance of elon musk on “saturday night live” which has not yet aired when i am typing this but will have aired by the time this newsletter lands in your inbox which he teased along with the epithet “the dogefather” so we’re expecting some shiba inu references which given elon’s power among the meme crowd could move the price even more should the regulators go after elon for talking about dogecoin public figures often talk about their investments – should that be banned when does that morph from protecting the public to restricting speech at the risk of sounding ingenuous elon is not out there touting dogecoin’s fundamentals should he be banned from talking about things he finds funwhen the economic value of an investable asset is driven entirely by collective enthusiasm as well as meme amplification on social media then what really can regulators do how do you damp said enthusiasm without trampling on fundamental human liberties which will ignite the crypto crowd even morewhat’s more it seems like both access to the asset and its potential use case are broadening crypto exchange gemini and multiasset brokerage platform etoro now offer dogecoin trading the oakland athletics has become the first major league baseball team to accept dogecoin for tickets to games and the american cancer society now allows dogecoin donationsif all these questions are giving you a headache imagine how those of us who need to explain this feel it’s enthralling but also disconcerting and reconciling the two is a strugglepersonally i believe fears the regulators will come down hard on the crypto industry are overblown yes people will lose money when the dogecoin market corrects and that’s a huge pity but that happens outside of cryptocurrencies too and us regulators are no doubt aware that interfering with personal choice and financial freedom generally doesn’t end wellas securities and exchange commission commissioner hester peirce said in a recent appearance on coindesk tv “if  are just having fun they can do that as well but don’t come complaining to the government if you lose your money”a mainstream marriagesports are mainstream crypto assets are not yet so the deepening relationship between the two is an intriguing development that will help crypto reach more mainstream markets and help sports teams and athletes appear more “cutting edge” and of course there’s the potential incomethe overlap mainly comes from two intriguing trendsindividual athletes taking their salary in bitcoincrypto company sponsorship of athletic teams and venuesboth saw a handful of

custody specialist for  billion in stock and cash takeawaysthis will be the first ma deal over  billion in the crypto industry to date which is a sign of the growing maturity and weight of the market as well as of its principal playersgalaxy executives said last year that the firm was looking to become a crypto prime broker of which custody is an important part so this acquisition makes sense for that strategy last year bitgo launched its prime brokerage arm bitgo primemike novogratz galaxy digital’s founder and ceo has also said he wants to see his company become the “goldman sachs of the crypto banking world” which is interesting in that he used to be a partner at goldman sachs and goldman sachs was one of the early investors in bitgoas if this intricate web wasn’t confusing enough goldman sachs also hinted earlier this year that it is thinking of offering crypto custody services so we can expect more ma on the custody frontgoldman sachs nyse gs was in the crypto news twice this week once when it announced a new desk that will offer trading in bitcoin derivatives nondeliverable forwards and then again when it emerged as a lead investor in the latest raise for crypto data aggregator and index provider coin metrics takeaway in our writeup of the coin metrics raise we quoted a goldman sachs executive as saying “our clients will greatly benefit from coin metrics’ institutionalgrade data insights and emerging risk management tools” could this be a teaser of more services to comeinvestment management firm vaneck has filed with the sec for an etherbased exchangetraded fund takeaway if approved this would be the first ether etf in the us that’s a big “if” because the sec has yet to approve a btc etf canada on the other hand has approved several btc and eth etfs might the sec approve a btc and eth etf at the same time it’s possible but the us regulator has spent years getting familiar with the bitcoin markets – its surveillance price transparency liquidity etc – and it’s not clear that it has the same level of knowledge about ether’s markets which are complicated by the upcoming technology shift to eth square’s ndaq sq cash app generated  billion of revenue from its bitcoin operation in  and  million of gross profit both up approximately  from   takeaway this kind of result is likely to make other payments services sit up and take

trading custody and financing takeaway this is a reminder that institutions are increasingly asking their traditional banks for crypto services there are several institutionalgrade cryptofirst services that have good track records but let’s face it many institutions are going to prefer to deal with a name they already know trust and have accounts with this is unlikely to divert business away from the current roster of institutional crypto services rather it is likely to continue broadening the pool of participating deeppocketed investorsdigital currency group dcg the parent of investment manager grayscale and also of coindesk has authorized the purchase of up to  million worth of the grayscale bitcoin trust gbtc up from a  million level previously announced takeaway this is a smart move for two main reasons one it should act as a boost to the market of gbtc as well as to investor interest in the product which has effectively dried up as a result of the postlockup trading discount to nav and two if the trust gets converted into a redeemable etf as grayscale has said it intends to pursue then there’s a nice profit for dcglisted fintech company mogo ndaq mogo revealed it has bought approximately  worth of eth and almost  worth of btc as part of its plan to allocate up to  of its cash and investment portfolio in cryptocurrencies takeaway much has been written about the role of btc in corporate reserves – i have written about the likelihood of companies starting to hold eth as well so far few companies have revealed eth balance sheet positions meitu being a notable exception i expect we’ll see more of this in the coming months although i maintain my position that eth is better suited to a working capital holding than a storeofvalue treasury asset
