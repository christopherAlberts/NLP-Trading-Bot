yahoo financeâ€™s myles udland julie hyman brian sozzi and dan roberts discuss the market action for bitcoinvideo transcriptjulie hyman bitcoin we are watching it again this morning as we have all week as it has had an incredible climb again and a lot has been packed into this week when it comes to cryptocurrency news it was only on monday seems like a lot longer go than that that tesla revealed in a filing it had bought  and  billion in bitcoinwe also learned this week that mastercard was exploring accepting cryptocurrencies as payment bny mellon said it would support cryptotrading potentially and then cnbc reporting this morning that daniel pinto president of jp morgan said they didnt quite say that they would be supporting cryptotrading it was more sort of well if our clients want it then well have to do it it was more of a reluctant acceptance of whats going on out there we also talked remember to michael sonenshein of the grayscale bitcoin trust this weekwe heard from michael novogratz as well both of them saying that there is more risk at this point for professional investors not investing in bitcoin than investing in bitcoin so that has been a flip not sure ill believe that until we hear people who are not bitcoin investors making that kind of comment dan roberts is back with us hes been following all these developments also and this sort of narrative about adoption thats the big buzz word on the part of novogratz and others adoption adoption adoptiondan roberts yeah i agreejulie hyman i dont where the tipping point is or if were already past itdan roberts i agree with that being the buzz word julie because you know its one thing to just buy bitcoin for your balance sheet as an investment and hold onto it thats fine and some of these companies are doing that obviously that was part of the tesla news but more interesting is the companies that say that they want to accept it as payment now of course a fair retort to that is do people really want to use it as payment at a time when the price is soaring probably not they dont want to spend it but tesla says it eventually hopes to have customers use cryptocurrencies to buy its products maybe that means cars maybe that means something elsestory continuesand then of course you mentioned mastercard bny mellon and then just this morning i thought you were going to mention yet another one uber the ceo dara khosrowshahi in an interview saying that uber doesnt necessarily plan to buy bitcoin as an investment but it is considering allowing customers to pay in cryptocurrency on uber for rides as well as for uber eatsnow again no one really wants to spend their crypto right now but thats what we mean when we talk about adoption and i think thats the most significant step you talk about paypal thats adoption talk about square and that is sort of the rising tide right now that appears to be lifting other boats i mean gosh as you mentioned it was just a few days ago we were sort of saying whos next and then we woke up yesterday mastercard was next bny mellon was next twitters cfo went on cnbc and said that twitter is considering adopting crypto and buying bitcoin for its balance sheetso theres a parade happening right now and i think youre right to distinguish between kind of pure play crypto companies of course those people are bullish and noncrypto tech companies its those companies that when they come out and make a move i think thats what kind of really grabs peoples attentionmyles udland but you know dan its funny you mention adoption with respect to the spending of it because weve talked for years about how that narrative of bitcoin only works when people go out and spend it is completely flawed and not really what were talking about and so i feel like adoption is once companies and i found that the khosrowshahi comment curious because its like to me adoption is we realize bitcoin is a good part of an investment portfolio not that we would want to see customers using bitcoin so i mean i do wonder likejulie hyman i mean to be fair krosrowshahis comments were very tentative right he was asked he didnt volunteer that information and he kind of said yeah we would consider you know it wasnt like we are exploring this at this present moment it was kind of like yeah if people want it we might consider itmyles udland but hes still talking hes still talking about bitcoin though in a way that is not really in my view part of the serious conversation theres no serious conversation about is bitcoin going to replace the dollar its is bitcoin something that has to be part of an investment portfoliodan roberts well thats right and you guys i think its fair to point out that originally the white paper on bitcoin was peer to peer electronic cash system and people arent using it as cash now of course all the bulls just say store value digital gold thats fine thats good enough but i think the truth lies somewhere in the middle when people try to dismiss bitcoin because they say well you cant really spend it most places i cant buy my coffee with it well thats not the point thats fine and technologies evolve but its also true that if the only excitement in use case is buying it as an investment and holding onto it well thats not very exciting eitherso when i think of real exciting adoption it also really extends to a third bucket myles right we talk about adoption of letting customers pay in crypto adoption of investing in it for your balance sheet and then a third bucket would be embracing this decentralized technology you know and banks talked about doing that a while back but now were seeing decentralized finance and all kinds of new use cases and decentralized apps built on ethereum and thats sort of the most exciting adoption potentially if theres real day to day business use cases for itjulie hyman and whats interesting about that point is an analyst flagged to us earlier in the week when jack dorsey was asked about crypto on the call for twitter thats where he took it he talked about a decentralized technology potentially helping with content curation on a twitter he talked about that the model has been centralized its twitter deciding with its algorithms who sees what but what if the control for that was put in the hands of the users now didnt sound like theyre actually building that but he sort of brought it up as an interesting ideabut to come back to the payment question for just a second dan i still have trouble understanding how exactly it would if i wanted to buy a tesla with bitcoin like how is that going to work when the value like how is it a viable currency when the value fluctuates so much you know how do you how are you going to do the transfer how you know i just dont i have a hard time wrapping my head around just concretely how thats going to work right nowdan roberts well and to be clear i do not think right now its a viable day to day currency certainly not if youre a company and youre going to accept payment in crypto you better only do it because you are ready for the volatility and you are trusting that eventually the value is going to go up otherwise right its very simple why would a company take something that tomorrow could be worth a lot less money but clearly if youre elon musk if youre jack dorsey if youre dan schulman you believe in the future of this stuffand i guess id point to what jack dorsey said ages ago when square first kind of openly embraced bitcoin by adding crypto to its cash app he said i believe bitcoin is going to be the currency of the internet and i think that summarizes it nicely because it doesnt just mean that youre paying with it the currency of the internet means the underlying tech that its going to be used for a lot of things but youre certainly right julie if youre going to pay in crypto they better reduce a lot of that friction it has to be completely frictionless it cant be like when youre signing up for a subscription to a paywalled news site and you have to enter your credit card and enter your address and all the information but thats what some of these new coins are hoping to do is to allow frictionless micropayments onlinebrian sozzi dan let me read this comment to you it came from paypal ceo dan schulman at their investor day yesterday he said quote this is a once in a multidecade opportunity where the fundamental rails of the system are going to be redefined and we have a chance to help shape that now you have covered square and paypal for some time how far ahead are those two payments companies compared to othersdan roberts well i would put square at the forefront and you know this kind of bitcoin bull run was accelerated by the paypal news because paypal is certainly probably better known its more consumer facing squares a little kind of enterprisey and maybe not everyone knows it even though everyone has probably swiped their credit card on a square fob but its really square that has been doing this since  as i mentioned square was the first mover here and of course weve talked about twitter saying that its considering this week that to me was ah at long last dorseys other company eyeing crypto because square has been doing it for a whilesquare is the one that behind the scenes has been not only facilitating buying and holding a bitcoin in its cash app but then was the first kind of big name mover to just buy bitcoin as an investment for its balance sheet square bought  million worth which at the time was only  of its cashof course tesla makes more noise because tesla spent  of its cash on buying bitcoin but i would look to square as one of the companies that really is going to move the needle here in terms of big name fintech companies pushing widespread adoption paypals in that too and well see how many people really use that of course dan schulman in the most recent earnings report said that theyve been delighted by kind of the rate of adoption already in its paypal wallet but i still would bet you thats been pretty smallmyles udland yeah maybe its just because i and maybe i speak for myself here but working at a company like yahoo finance you see the world through the lens of the way companies do right so you think about investments first and foremost and to me the fact that big companies and big institutional managers now view bitcoin as a necessary investment to say we have covered all our bases is more confirmation of the space than i think even the biggest bulls could have hoped for a couple of years ago and i mean you think about it this way like you dont have a website that covers the dollar you have a website that covers things that happen because of the dollar so its not about how you use bitcoin its about the derivative plays on the ways that crypto works within the broader financial system that creates interest and demand and so on and so forthdan roberts well and just lastly if we have time i would say to that myles from a yahoo finance perspective and from the financial investor perspective thats certainly kind of the key thing right now is the institutional investment everyone says oh this current round has been driven by institutions thats fine and thats true but i would also say that the excitement in crypto right now has been accelerated by kind of the retail investor revolutionyou know its all tied up in one kind of convergence that the pandemic has really added to its regular people just never before even right now much more than in the  kind of hype cycle have i heard from as many regular people interested in this space wondering about it so youre right its wall street institutions and that excites people as an investment but i also think that youre going to see adoption by regular folks who wonder well what are the different use cases here and should i be into this stuff should it be something that i understand and want to learn aboutjulie hyman yeah if we were riding in taxis right now or ubers the drivers would be certainly asking us about this stuff all right thanks so much dave roberts really fun conversation there on crypto and on bitcoin
