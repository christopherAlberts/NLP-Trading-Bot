a new tool counts bitcoin mining activity and crossreferences users‚Äô locations to make a heat map of energy use by all bitcoin minerscounts bitcoin mining activity and crossreferences users‚Äô locations to make a heat map of energy use by all bitcoin miners it turns out bitcoin mining uses more electricity than entire countries including argentinamaking a more efficient bitcoinmining algorithm would go against the spirit of bitcoin miningscientists from the university of cambridge judge business school have built an interactive analysis tool to calculate the real energy cost of bitcoin cryptocurrency using their energy use model the researchers found that bitcoin mining uses more energy each year than the entire country of argentinathat sounds like a wild stat but energy use has always been a key part of bitcoin‚Äôs story let‚Äôs go back to the beginning and see how we got here‚û° join pop mech pro and get exclusive answers to your most pressing science questionshow do you mine bitcoinbitcoin is a cryptocurrency which means it‚Äôs a shared encrypted publicly available form of money made by building links in a longer and longer blockchain code blockchain refers to the collective record called a ledger that stores cryptocurrency transactions like a communal excel spreadsheetthis record is stored on volunteers‚Äô computers which run software that verifies transactions checking to make sure that both parties agreed to the change and the buyer has enough currency to honor it these volunteers are called miners and the reward for volunteering their hardware is kickbacks in the form of more cryptocurrencythis content is imported from embedname you may be able to find the same content in another format or you may be able to find more information at their web siteif enough computers conclude that yes this is a valid exchange that verification joins the rest of the world‚Äôs recent transactions as a ‚Äúblock‚Äù to prevent people from generating counterfeit currency the math required to verify a transaction takes so much computing power that no one user or group could do itpeople ‚Äúmine‚Äù bitcoin then by tasking computers to process complicated math usually in the background on real users‚Äô computers or even on dedicated machines miners use highend graphics cards or gpus because these pieces of hardware are already made to churn through computer math as quickly as possible and with a lot of calculations running at the same time like a highway with more lanes this reduces congestion and travel time it also heats up your pc usually requiring highend fans to matchlately pc gamers have had trouble finding parts like highend nvidia  series and amd  series graphics cards partly because cryptocurrency miners have snatched them up that‚Äôs on top of a global microprocessor shortage what is the energy cost of mining bitcointhe cambridge team‚Äôs tool counts mining activity and crossreferences users‚Äô locations to make a

entire country of argentina  terrawatt hours  the netherlands  twh and the united arab emirates  twh and it‚Äôs gradually approaching norway  twhbecause this model only considers bitcoin however that means the real energy cost of cryptocurrency overall is even higher bitcoin is just one example of an industry that includes dogecoin marscoin and so forth‚û° stuff we love the best gaming laptopsbest

hours each year but bitcoin algorithms are designed to be inefficient uses of energy with a lotterylike quality critics say meaning any amount of energy spent mining them is not worth its relative energy cost around the world including in the us about  percent of energy is still from coal power plants ‚Äúit‚Äôs very bad that all this energy is being literally wasted in a lottery‚Äù blockchain expert david gerard told the bbccan bitcoin mining get betteris it possible to make a more efficient bitcoin mining algorithm that would go against the spirit of bitcoin mining so it‚Äôs hard to imagine the whole point of mining is that it is slow and that it does involve tons of computation ‚Äúbitcoin is literally antiefficient  more efficient mining hardware won‚Äôt help‚Äîit‚Äôll just be competing against other efficient mining hardware‚Äù gerard said ‚Äúthis means that bitcoin‚Äôs energy use and hence its  production only spirals outwards‚Äùwhy is that well the cambridge team explains that making mining a slow and arduous process is how bitcoin‚Äôs creators try to ensure the currency isn‚Äôt hijacked by malicious actors‚Äún order to preserve its decentralised nature and as a result its censorship resistance bitcoin precisely needs to be inefficient in order prevent a single entity or colluding group of actors to easily gain control and dominate the network‚Äùthat means the inefficiency is part of what bitcoin must do to exist and we must grapple with its environmental costs firsthand instead of thinking of some shortcut solutionüé• now watch thisadditional
