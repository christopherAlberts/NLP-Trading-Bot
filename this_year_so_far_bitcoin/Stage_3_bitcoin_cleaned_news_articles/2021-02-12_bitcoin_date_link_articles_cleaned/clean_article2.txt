bitcoin is not moneytheoretically and legally cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are not money despite what some people may think money serves three functions it is a medium of exchange a unit of account and a store of valuenot many goods and services are priced in and settled by bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies bitcoin is not universally accepted as a unit of account and a means of payment granted many cryptocurrency payment apps have been created in recent years to promote its use but none of them has made it to the core of the world’s daily transactions and payments  except for some underworld transactionscrucially cryptos are priced in usd or other fiat currencies so they are no different from any item priced in usd standing on the opposite side of money in a transaction veteran bitcoin investor mark cuban summarised it succinctly when he said“for cryptocurrency to be money it bitcoin would have to be so easy to use it’s a nobrainer it would have to be completely frictionfree and understandable by everybody first so easy in fact that grandma could do it”to legally qualify as money a means of payment must be granted a status by a country’s laws as its official monetary unit this legal tender status allows debtors to pay their obligationsliabilities by transferring them to creditors as recognised and approved by lawrecent research found that  of the world’s central banks were either not allowed to issue digital currency under the existing laws or their legal frameworks are ambiguous and do not clearly permit them to do so  china however passed a law in  allowing its central bank to issue a digital currency  hence the birth of the world’s first official digital currency the digital currency electronic payment dcep  despite being digital dcep is strictly speaking not a cryptocurrencylegal tender status is usually given to means of payment that can be easily transferred and used by the population in daily life to use bitcoin or cryptocurrencies a digital infrastructure including computers smartphones internet networks and connectivity must be in place this condition makes it unrealistic for cryptocurrencies to become money it echoes mark cuban’s argument against bitcoin as moneybitcoin is a vehicle for speculatorsbitcoin supporters say it is an investible asset investible yes in the speculative sense in my view asset i am not surethere is an income stream associated with a financial asset granted there are assets with a zero yield such as commodities but they are traded because they have a practical use for production or consumption crypto­currencies have neither an income stream nor a practical usethe fact that they command a price and are tradable suggests that speculation would be their single most important ‘raison d’être’ hence crypto prices are subject to violent and random movement this brings up the other problem store of valuebitcoin is not a store of valuefor something to serve as a store of value it has to be liquid universally accepted and have a stable value cryptocurrencies including bitcoin certainly do not have any of these characteristicsbitcoin trading suffers from illiquidity and manipulation because of the existence of “whale wallets” wallets holding disproportionately large amounts of bitcoinsin late  the top  wallets were estimated to own  of total bitcoin supply  with most of the owners’ identities not known it would therefore only take a few whale wallets to manipulate the bitcoin market causing violent price moves huge price volatility has made bitcoin and cryptocurrencies unsuitable as store of value vehiclesfixed supply is a problem not necessarily a benefitcontrary to the conventional wisdom that the finite supply of bitcoins and cryptos is a benefit and protects value it is in fact a big problem for them being considered as moneythe maximum number of bitcoins that can ever be mined is  million at the time of writing there are already  million bitcoins in circulation the last bitcoin would be mined in  all cryptocurrencies have a finite supply and the speed at which they can be increased is uncertain and not controllable by anyonethese supply limitations make cryptocurrencies unsuitable as legal tender because the static money supply would deprive central banks of the ability to conduct countercyclical policyhowever crypto promoters have capitalised on wide­spread fear and distrust of fiat money arising from postglobalfinancialcrisis gfc monetisation they have skillfully twisted this supply problem into an argument for cryptocurrencies as a hedge against doomsday scenarios i believe this is wrongwhat nextchina which used to be the largest crypto mining country has seen through the smoke and mirrors and has cracked down on trading and mining without reservation this shows how quickly regulators could destroy the freewheeling decentralised crypto market china instead has created an official dcep with centralised controlwhat crypto aficionados do not appear to understand is that countries will take steps to protect their monetary systems and currencies and their ability to tax and manage the economy the more people believe cryptocurrencies are money the greater the risk of government intervention in this market the emerging trend of official digital currencies is a sign of central banks fighting backthe popular narrative that bitcoin’s finite supply guarantees its value can play into concerns over central bank quantitative easing and what these qe programmes might mean for fiat money thus the rise of cryptocurrencies can be seen as reflecting the antiestablishment movements in many countries since the  gfcviewed positively this crypto protest could prompt governments to change their economic management to become more responsible and regain trust and credibility time will telli believe crypto prices will eventually crash this could be triggered by a shift in monetary policy or regulations alternatively a crash could simply occur because prices are so inflated that much like the dutch tulip mania marginal buyers are priced out of the market leading to a selffeeding process of liquidation and falling prices when leveraged investors start to sellalso readcryptorenminbi to challenge us dollar many gold atm machines and settlement mechanisms were installed around the world in the early  as players were trying to promote the use of gold as an alternative to fiat money and a medium of exchange for daily transactions however they failed because of low public acceptance and the inconvenience of using gold for transactions crypto apps could suffer a similar fate in my view see “mark cuban this is what it would take for me to change my mind about bitcoin” necn money report
