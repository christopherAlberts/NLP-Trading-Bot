“you’d have to shut down the internet” hester peirce commissioner to the us securities and exchange commission sec on implementing a bitcoin banalthough bitcoin’s market capitalization has surpassed  trillion statements from governmental authorities and business leaders continue to fuel speculation about a us ban on bitcoin us treasury secretary janet yellen has publicly criticized bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for their role in “illicit finance” in the private sector ray dalio founder of the world’s largest hedge fund has commented that bitcoin may be outlawed just as gold was in the  jesse powell the ceo of kraken a usbased cryptocurrency exchange has also warned that “there could be some crackdown” on the digital assetscould the united states implement such a “crackdown” by joining countries like india nigeria and turkey in implementing a ban on bitcoin while a complete ban is certainly feasible the practical legal economic and political difficulties of implementing such a ban make it unlikely instead we can expect the us to join other developed economies in further regulating bitcoin regulators will face the challenge of writing laws that can be enforced without strangling the new opportunities for economic growth that bitcoin offers those countries that embrace itpractical challengesa basic understanding of blockchain technology underscores the practical challenges of a bitcoin ban“blockchain” describes a decentralized and distributed ledger that records the histories and transactions associated with digital assets bitcoin is a virtual asset that is accessed and recorded on such a blockchainthe term “cryptocurrency” is a slight misnomer since bitcoin is more like a decentralized network than a traditional currency that can be held or confiscated from a regulated custodian instead of holding physical “coins” or having access to an “account” with a regulated third party a bitcoin holder uses private keys to unlock digital assets recorded on the blockchain maintained by a decentralized and global network of computers these private keys are often represented in a series of words known as a “recovery phrase”that can be memorized and used to access bitcoin anywhere in the world with an internet connection thus bitcoin cannot be confiscated any more than memories canwhile the united states could criminalize ownership of bitcoin it would be all but impossible to enforce such a ban specifically there would be no way for the government to confiscate bitcoin from its global decentralized network the government would be unable to grab recovery phrases memorized by holders who refuse to share them or claim that they are lost or stolen furthermore bans in other countries show that this move could be counterproductive for example when the central bank of nigeria prohibited local financial institutions from servicing cryptocurrency firms buyers and sellers began using peertopeer trading platforms to trade bitcoin at a price premium in that countrylegal challengesthe political speech that has been a part of the bitcoin network since inception and the bitcoin network’s inherent associative nature would also make any ban on this asset subject to strong first amendment challengesbitcoin was created as a public network where participants make immutable entries on an electronic ledger while the most visible manifestation of these entries is the exchange of value bitcoin is more than merely money according to noted bitcoin advocate andreas antonopoulous “saying bitcoin is digital money is like saying the internet is a fancy telephone it’s like saying that the internet is all about email money is just the first application”in fact the bitcoin network has been used for political speech from its inception the first “genesis” block or recording of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain included the following statement “the times  chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” on the day of its nasdaq initial public offering ipo coinbase had a mining pool embed the following headline into the bitcoin blockchain “nytimes  house gives final approval to bidens  pandemic relief bill” these messages which serve as commentary on the role of central banks and governmental authorities cannot be censored and can be read by anyone with an internet connection unlike the occasional handwriting scribbled on a perishable paper dollar political statements have been permanently and irretrievably etched into the bitcoin blockchain from its very beginning and throughout significant moments in its historythe political speech bitcoin has expressed from its founding as a networked association outside the reach of centralized authorities should subject any attempted ban to the strictest scrutiny because the first amendment has been broadly applied to emerging new technologies it would be reasonable to expect a similarly broad application to blockchain technology itself a particularly detailed discussion on why bitcoin is speech can be found hereopponents of a bitcoin ban in the us would also have arguments for due process under the fourth fifth and fourteenth amendments to the us constitution the irs categorizes bitcoin as property and thus any ban would arguably represent an unconstitutional seizure the us government itself has seized and sold bitcoin further legitimizing its status as property protected by the constitution while the government could counter this argument by offering holders a window in which to convert their bitcoin to us dollars the potential loss of hundreds of billions of net worth to individuals and publiclytraded companies would hardly result in “just compensation” guaranteed by the constitutioneconomic challengeseven if the us government could legally ban bitcoin doing so would be economically prohibitivemuch of the value in bitcoin has been created and is held by us companies for example tesla has purchased  billion in bitcoin coinbase is a publiclytraded and usbased cryptocurrency exchange with a market value of over  billion and mainstream banks like jpmorgan chase and goldman sachs are launching cryptocurrency investment products furthermore payment companies like visa and paypal are helping thousands of small businesses accept bitcoin for goods and services although opponents may parrot claims that bitcoin is used by terrorists and drug dealers blockchain analysis suggests that only a small and shrinking fraction of bitcoin transactions are used for nefarious purposesthe numerous applications of bitcoin for storing value authentication and sharing intellectual property promise to create many new companies just as the internet did in the late  and early  any ban or crushing regulation by the us government would squander an opportunity to remain a world leader in new technologiespolitical challengesjust as bitcoin has grown exponentially so has its political influence this influence combined with practical legal and economic factors will likely result in the us government creating regulatory certainty rather than an outright ban of bitcoincompanies and individuals with significant exposure already have significant political influence according to coindesk sam bankmanfried the ceo of cryptocurrency derivatives platform ftx made the second largest donation to joe biden’s presidential campaign recently fidelity investments square and coinbase joined forces to launch a bitcoin trade group to lobby policy makersas the number of bitcoin users continues its rapid growth any attempted ban would be met with not only corporate lobbying resistance but also the wrath of an exponentially growing and passionate block of the voting public indeed coinbase the largest usbased cryptocurrency exchange has reported approximately  million verified users in  up from  million in  coinbase cofounder fred ehrsam tweeted that  of people now own cryptocurrencies in the united states while the accuracy of this claim may be debatable there is no dispute that this rapidly growing group would exert significant political pressure in response to any proposed banconclusionuntil there is greater regulatory clarity regarding bitcoin the statements of some prominent government figures and business leaders will continue to fuel speculation about the imminent demise of this emerging asset although an outright ban would be unworkable for the aforementioned reasons further regulation can be expected if this regulation is narrowly tailored to avoid strangling the emerging bitcoin economy it could bring newfound legitimacy to the digital asset minimize its use for illicit purposes and bring additional price stabilitythis is a guest post by stuart russell opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of
