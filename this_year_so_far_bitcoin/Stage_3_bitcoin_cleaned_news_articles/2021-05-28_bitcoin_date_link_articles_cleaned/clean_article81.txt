it’s a rocky time for bitcoin but one crypto trade show celebrates the notable faces of mainstreamingelon musk isn’t personally responsible for bitcoin’s recent misfortunes but the optics around the situation aren’t great for him shortly after musk tweeted a statement suspending the purchase of tesla vehicles using bitcoin bitcoin dropped  since then fears of a crackdown on bitcoin mining operations in china have continued the downward slide which has taken btc from it’s april high over  to under  this week institutional investors began trading btc for gold while retail investors and bitcoin adherents hodl in equal parts concern and optimismin this atmosphere coindesk launched it’s “big tent” virtual crypto summit consensus investor and hedge fund manager ray dalio headlined the event as opening keynote speaker dalio’s address was really a prerecorded interview in which he shared thoughts on the future of money and monetary policy but what words of comfort did dalio have for the virtually assembled adherents of the cryptoverse perhaps the cure for musk’s negative sentiment regarding bitcoin could be found in the words of another extremely wealthy person“i have some bitcoin” dalio stated flatly when asked in the latter quarter of the interview it made immediate headlines sometimes it isn’t so much about what is said so much as who is saying itothers also have some bitcoinmichael jcasey coindesk chief content officer described the theme of this year’s event in interview with benzinga as “the convergence of economic disruption from  lockdowns and stimulus efforts with explosive financial innovation across an array of digital asset and blockchain projects is poised to transform money as we know it”it seemed that in the contentheavy event there was another running theme perhaps more implied than intentional  the mainstreaming of crypto especially through bitcoin and nftsstory continuesin his keynote on nfts entrepreneur author and speaker gary vaynerchuk said “could you imagine if you were able to buy the original mickey mouse cell if you could have actually bought the derivative if this was now and walt disney was now that first drawing of mickey mouse”vaynerchuk has been an avid supporter of bitcoin and nfts for some time now producing multiple videos for his channel on how to make nfts and buy crypto as a successful content producer it’s easy to imagine vaynerchuk’s excitement in monetizing and promoting content through nftsvaynerchuk recently released his own line of nfts and he said “this is going to be the greatest era of intellectual property ownership”nfl quarterback and seventime superbowl champion tom brady appeared as a “surprise guest” on wednesday and followedup by posting a twitter profile picture with “laser eyes”  a sign of support for bitcoin reaching the role of influenceit seems that with mainstreaming comes an everexpanding cast of characters that arrive to promote bitcoin and crypto overallhowever bitcoin in particular seems especially susceptible to the public opinions of influential people after all bitcoin’s value is “staked” in belief and in the past  months that belief has proven more steady than most traditional assets but do influencers play an overall positive role in the crypto communitywhen asked if influencers play a positive role in crypto oliver gale ceo of panther protocol responded “replace the industry and the question is the same do public figures celebs and influencers play a positive role in society we live in a world where individuals can have enormous sway over different sectors and sometimes it can be positive and sometimes less so however the fact that public figures are talking about blockchain and crypto is good in general as it means we are approaching the days of mass adoption and awareness”however you measure influence notable personalities wield in public sentiment around crypto it’s clear that the phenomenon is amplified greatly by social media and as mainstreaming continues it isn’t just famous people promoting crypto in a way that has an impact as we have seen with fintok  the fintech arm of tiktok a relative newcomer next to other monolithic social media platforms but one that has already reached nearly  billion users with an emphasis on millennial and generation z audiences fintok has had an impact in the rising fortunes of coins like doge which has left some of the crypto investing community feeling “trolled” but not everyone sees its influence as negative“from a microperspective its shaking up the investment industry as a whole and speeds up decentralization and a renewed voice to explain crypto regulations and technical analysis from the macroperspective its rewriting the narrative on how brands perceive their target investor” jordan anderson chief operating officer of bitbuy saidas for the opinion of elon musk  at the end of day  after  pm et justin sun shared an anecdote during his brief end of day  when the moderator asked sun how he feels about being the bad boy of crypto sun said one of the best comments ive heard about elon musk was elon musk is gonna be the next justin sunperhaps musk will supplant sun in his roleseeking decentralization in a centralized worldpart of the appeal of the show is its diversity of topics in a contentrich event that spans morning until well after business hours for five days one of the most compelling presentations in our estimation took place midconference in the  pm et time slotpresented by dr robert epstein senior research psychologist american institute for behavioral research and technology amy james coinventor of open index protocol and devon read james inventor of open index protocol the presentation was sobering in its characterization of how tech giants like google are not only tracking users’ behavior but also using that information to manipulate users toward desired behaviorsdr epstein showed leaked internal communications between google employees in which they discussed how to use “ephemeral experiences” to shift public opinion on policies by the  us president these ephemeral experiences are particularly troubling because as the name suggests they are packaged content experiences intended to persuade  and then disappear effectively these ephemeral experiences turn seemingly neutral sources like google into propaganda distribution channels in a way that is untraceable and untracked“there are three motivators  the main one of course is to make money but also to manipulate votes and to advance the prevailing values of the company” dr epstein said “this manipulation has a profound impact on people without their knowledge”dr epstein said that the solution is to monitor google and other tech giants with “systems that do to them what they do to us and then expose them”open index protocol oip is working to make an open source index of metadata information  and hold tech companies accountable for their actions while allowing start ups to compete with companies like google which relies on its enormous index to push out competing search engines“theres a tension on the web today between freedom of expression and the rights of private companies the reason this tension exists is there isnt a true public space on the web the platforms we really think of like twitter are private companies not public spaces so since the early  the web has evolved into a walled garden model on the one hand regulation compliance would be practically impossible to monitor and enforce on the other hand breaking them up would make it even easier for information to be suppressed” james said in her part of the presentationwe interviewed james to ask how oip metadata index would be used in practical terms and whether this is a necessary building block of web “web  will mean users’ data and anonymity is protected by default processes usually done by centralized data centers are instead done by open networks deep fakes are the source of funny gags but not real threats to information dissemination and creative content producers can earn a real and reliable living to achieve these goals absolutely requires a unified and open metadata layer” james saidconclusionit’s an interesting time to observe the crypto and blockchain community interacting with bitcoin down and in a virtual event that is far from the inperson trade show experienceit’s safe to assume that this is all part of the “new normal”  a term that is rather a glib summary of some monumental shifts in behavior necessitated by the pandemic  but the change is not entirely negativethe community is quick to point out that the principles of blockchain support decentralized experiences but one thing lacking from the experience is most real twoway communication most sessions had no time for questions and when there was time the questions had to be carefully picked out by the moderator from numerous requests for the token giveaways consensus used to incentivize attendeesoverall the experience has the feeling of a workinprogress according to casey attendance was approximately  this year down from  last year  although it is not an even comparison since consensus  was a free event and the  event was notultimately any time the community takes time from their projects to communicate with each other is a small success for blockchain after all if the voices of crypto influencers are disproportionately strong the logical solution is to use our own voices and guide the discourse around the innovations
