the arrival of nfts in the mainstream has brought a new crowd to cryptocurrency and its blockchain technologynonfungible tokens nfts are tied to files like serial numbers to show ownership they’ve become popular among the arts and collectibles’ crowdthe format exploded in sales during a high point of this spring’s digital markets but projections differ wildly one suggests nft markets will double by october another says sales are coolingnot everyone is on board with nfts or the cryptocurrency ecosystem some who are just becoming aware of the format are joining environmentalists and others who criticize the cryptoworld’s energyconsuming mining processthe industry has critics from the finance side as well critics say market upheavals in bitcoin and other digital currencies mean the digital markets are full of hype and show instabilitystill illinois state university finance professor alan cring is among many who believe in riding out the wild rides of the markets — even with last week’s crypto market crash cryptocurrencies have real staying power he saidgoogle maps there are bitcoin atms all around bloomingtonnormaland hes not alone although most stores around here dont use cryptocurrency yet crypto atms are turning up everywhere a quick search of google maps shows dozens of locations in the twin cities allow using a debit card to buy crypto“there will be ups and downs in this but as it expands and as more and more very powerful and wealthy institutions and other entities get involved in it they’re not going to let this go down”said cringmany blame the crash on china’s altcoin crackdown us regulatory talk and on tesla founder elon musk — as an influencer he has waffled on bitcoin support often blasting his views on social mediato be clear i strongly believe in crypto but it can’t drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use especially coal — elon musk elonmusk may  the volatility also matters to digital artist ryan bliss of rural mclean county bliss said some nft marketplaces have open access meaning they could prey on artists unfamiliar with the upload process transaction fees sometimes are high regardless if the artist ends up earning any profits“that’s what i worry about that these community marketplaces are kind of taking advantage of the hype and selling shovels during the gold rush” said blissothers say the biggest obstacle for cryptocurrency is also its strongest feature it isn’t tied to a country illinois wesleyan university finance professor jaime peters said decentralization — having the checks and balances performed by users as a whole — was core to the creators of industry giant bitcointhat platform disrupted the financial world in  when launched by satoshi nakamoto the pseudonym of the person or group behind the launch in little over a decade the landscape has evolved to many platforms“what’s behind bitcoin there’s nothing there’s nothing there there’s no central government manipulating it which is true but there’s also no central government supporting it” said petersthese cryptocurrency platforms make the users as a collective responsible rather than in individual company or government“there is nobody responsible for any problem happening so there’s no guarantee of protection” echoed shaoen wu state farm endowed chair for isu’s cybersecurity program hes in favor of more regulations for the industrysome investors like cryptocurrencys decentralized model because of its lowinterest rates and possible high yield according to jim jones executive director of isu’s katie school of insurance and financial serviceshe said cryptocurrency also can be a way to diversify portfolios beyond the traditional options of gold platinum or silver typically you have those commodities so when the world seems more risky you have something to fall back on if big wars disrupt these reallife currencies maybe cryptocurrencies could be that he saidother investors don’t like the lack of consumer protection and the fact criminals use the virtual cash to get nontraceable payoffs said jonesthe recent colonial pipeline cyberattack resulted in a ransom of  million dollars — in bitcoinmining’s environmental coststhen there’s global climate change drawing other critics to the sceneone of the biggest criticisms of the cryptocurrency world is its reliance on a proofofwork model earlier this month tesla’s musk joined the vocal critics calling on the industry to move away from the model that uses a ton of fossil fuelsthis spring as nfts gained a huge following it also brought more people to consider the concerns about the carbon footprint from nfts processingbliss said many in the digital arts community paid attention when artstation announced plans to launch its own nft platform less than a day later they ditched the plan because of so much backlashand bliss said on one of his digital blasphemy social media pages a recent discussion on nfts drew more than  comments most of the artists and art fans on the thread seemed to be collectively scratching their head about the new format many were concerned about the environmental costsisu’s cring also is a digital artist he’s uploaded some of his art as nfts he said bliss’ concerns about artists getting swept up in a “gold rush” mentality has some truth to it so he encourages fellow artists to research marketplaces before making the leap to creating nfts some marketplaces only will charge gas or transaction fees if the nft sellsbut its much more common that gas fees are part of the uploading process regardless if an item sells those gas fees are an environmental concerna move to more energyefficient modelscryptocurrency’s infrastructure — created with bitcoin’s launch — is blockchain that’s a decentralized digital ledger peters said think of the record keeping like this first we used a single bank then a computer network and later a cloud now we have blockchain“it sits on thousands and thousands of computers” she said instead of a single government backing the transaction all the users do creating a web of interconnected duplicated recordsbut that model’s original form using a proofofwork model has drawn heavy criticism for its impact on the environmentin proofofwork blockchain uses complex computer calculations to solve equations in cryptocurrency models closing a block results in earnings for miners that’s what the gas fees are tied tothat leads to an incentive to go and find the next coins so you have more and more energy being used crypto’s growth has translated to mining warehouses filled with energyguzzling computersmoving to proofofstake is the direction of most new platform developers for this reason various test nets are popping up including ethereum  and cardano eos and tron are just a few another new kid in town is a cryptocurrency called internet computer that token allows users to create apps websites and other webbased servicesinternet computer blockchain singularitysome central illinois digital artists won’t make nfts yet partly because of this issue but others say participating doesn’t prevent a focus on green solutionsisu creative technologist rick valentin who released a set of nfts this spring said nfts are just a drop in the bucket of the digital markets reducing carbon emissions drastically is imperative but that includes emissions from oil and plastics too he saidisu physics professor david marx who teaches classes on energy and the environment said after reading up on this topic he’s not a fan he said major digital currency blockchains only process a few transactions at a time— with an enormous electrical power drainsome estimates show bitcoin and ethereum — the latter which caters to nfts — have a combined annual electricity usage equal to  million us homes according to marxjones calls bitcoin the most damaging to the environment because of its sheer sizethe website digiconomist has been at the forefront of tracking the impact updating those figures regularly on its bitcoin energy consumption index signs show the energy usage continues to riseand jones blame’s musk’s celebrity move into bitcoin — with a  billion investment — for drawing hordes to the platform thus shooting the energy usage through the roofthe billionaires influence could swing the pendulum toward greener cryptocurrency too though last week after he spoke against bitcoins proofofwork model more miners announced theyd be joining the crypto climate accordthe privatesector led movement — based on the paris climate agreement — aims to create a cryptocurrency world with zero carbon emissions by there are nearly  cryptocoins the growing field is finding more identifying as greencring said those newdeveloping cryptocurrencies are more often than not working toward more energyfriendly versions but he said the tech world needs to think even further outside the box“we need to create blockchain on green energy build a better blockchain” he said “make it so the blockchain — every level — proofs its own ability to sustain itself” he added tech company devvio is exploring that kind of zeroemissions ideanot all blockchain is about moneythe coin versions causing the climate damage are just one type of blockchain in use said shaoen wu isus state farm endowed chair of cybersecurityblockchain just refers to a specific type of database — one that stores its information in blocks that chain together after a block closes the information is locked there and not able to be changed or erased one growing popularity use for blockchains is decentralized apps or dapps for shortillinois wesleyan university’s jaime peters notes industries such as accounting and finance like blockchain’s permanent transactions and records that can’t be altered or lost adding state farm ilikes it toowu said blockchain technology will mature but it’s a mystery how it will turn out“it will come somehow but in what kind of format that i don’t know” he saidwhen looking at cryptocurrency blockchain and other developments it’s important to remember technology in and of itself isn’t good or bad said wu how people use it is key he notedwu explores ways to stop those bad actors in how cryptocurrency fits in with the fields of artificial intelligence and the newer field of internet of things he said some cybersecurity faculty have focused research on the blockchain and students in the program get the opportunity to see how their future roles in security will interact with that technology tooat one time people couldn’t imagine a tiny phoneslashcomputer could fit in a pocket or that we could see a friend’s face a continent away and have a live conversation but that’s normal to us nowsome see nfts as disrupting how the art world does business some see cryptocurrency as disrupting the financial world but cring said blockchain’s arrival into our daily lives represents a much larger cultural moment“this is disruption there’s not a continuity of experience that’s going to happen this isn’t down the road this is happening right now all around us” he saidcring said nfts and related technologies are here to stay regardless of people’s opposition“those of you who don’t want to do nfts go for it you’re following your conscience i admire that however it’s still going to happen” he saidbut unfortunately responsibility for the environment responsibility to human rights and all of those things are secondary matters to business according to the finance professor business will do what it must to create the newest products and knowledge that’s very related to the digital world he said“unless the internet dies this isn’t going away” he said
