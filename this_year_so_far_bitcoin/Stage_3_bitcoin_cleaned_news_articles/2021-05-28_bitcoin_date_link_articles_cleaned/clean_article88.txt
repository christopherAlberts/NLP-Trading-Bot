last february i predicted that the crypto market would breach  in market capitalization less than a year later that prediction came trueroughly  months after that the total market cap for all crypto markets including security tokens rounded the corner of keep that in mind as we dive into the current debate around cryptocurrency and its impact on the environmentfirst some real talkwe are being naive if we do not acknowledge that media corporations roughly  parent entities control over  of all mainstream media are not in the business of offering unbiased “truth”sadly journalism as an institution is largely a relic of the past that’s a massive problem obviously but a topic for another daythe reality is that we have forprofit corporations who purvey human attention to the highest bidder “news” is now marketing for the most part facts and truth are signals that must be extracted from the noisewith that said let’s see if we can find a signalnftsthe environmental impact debate around cryptocurrencies began to reach a critical mass a few months ago before elon musk decided to jump inthe debate began around the specific impact of nfts being minted on the ethereum blockchainwhat is interesting is that blockchain technology has been consuming energy for over  years but for some odd reason nobody made a fuss until just recentlya sudden appearance of a narrative being pushed into the mainstream news cycle remember not journalism but marketing almost always indicates a coordinated campaign rather than an organic grassroots event back to that in a momentregarding the initial hubbub around nfts the environmental impact argument is largely out of context and based on ignorance of how blockchains workcase in pointethereum  of what bitcoin is using in the chart belownfts only represent about  of all ethereum transactionsin terms of energy consumption minting an nft isn’t the lead catalyst on ethereum that would be miningpairing ethereum with a sidechain technology a framework that batches transactions together to reduce overall mining impactfees like polygon reduces operational load and fees by roughly it’s also relevant to note that there seems to be no consensus on how to calculate a “carbon footprint” googling calculators reveals several different approaches is there an actual science based approach for this who knowswhat many people don’t know is that most of the conversation around “carbon footprints” was actually a pr strategy funded by bp to distract from who the true culprits aremusk vs bitcoinelon musk via tesla holds roughly  bitcoin recently musk announced that tesla would no longer accept bitcoin due to its alleged negative impact on the environmentnegative impact compared to what see chart above context is king in this conversation the announcement sparked off a debate with various pundits each with their own agendasof course i also have an agenda but as an entrepreneur and professional advisor i am more interested in facts than propaganda facts are what get problems solvedin addition to the chart above provided by ark investment management another key indicator provided by mike novogratz’s firm galaxy digital comes by way of an independent audit showing that bitcoin uses roughly ½ the energy of traditional banking systemsit doesn’t help musk’s argument that along with his tweets around bitcoin energy consumption that he doubled down on his promotion of dogecoin which is a meme coin created offthecuff as a joke by insinuating that he had been working with dogecoin devs on making it more energy efficient and better than bitcointhe problem is that there are no official “dogecoin devs” and that most of the devs on that project are actually bitcoin engineersevery suggestion musk has made in that regard is not technically feasible given dogecoin’s architecture musk was taken to task by crypto advocates in social media over the past week and the general consensus in the industry is that he is either completely ignorant on how blockchains work or is trollingmy experience over the past several years in the crypto space including the pioneering of a security token model for venture investment and capital raising gives me a better than layman’s understanding of the topics at handmy assessment is that much of the narrative around environmental impact regarding cryptocurrency is simply that – a narrative a narrative being promoted by an agendathe same applies to elon musk’s tweetsthe bigger meta framing this entire conversation though is vastly more significant imothe big metathe recent pullback in bitcoin price had been expected by industry leaders the musk announcement had some impact but wasn’t the reason for the pullback as is being widely “reported”going back to my  market cap prediction and the fact that less than  months after that happened the crypto market including security tokens breached  indicates that we are reaching a critical mass inflection point where exponential growth becomes the normenvironmental impact of blockchain technology is irrelevant in the big scheme of things and will become increasingly so once new consensus mechanisms eliminating high energy consumption proof of work mechanisms come online over the next  monthswhat is relevant to widespread adoption of cryptocurrency is usability and real world application this is the thesis behind my work on the make crypto easy campaign and its flagship product digital namesdigital names enables crypto users to create a simple humanreadable name to replace the long alphanumerical addresses used in digital walletsdigital names for cryptocurrency and digital wallets do what domain names did for the internet back in the  rather than remember a numerical ip address for a website you can simply type in wwwgooglecom and arrive at the desired destinationthe projected growth of this nascent industry is potentially larger than the domain name service industry which currently grosses about  billion a yearas part of this campaign i’ve been working closely with a consortium of telco and manufacturing companies on a stealth project aimed at delivering an interoperable solution that would bring an entirely new spectrum of networked communication between the traditional internet blockchains and iot internet of things enabled devicesmy career focus has been on empowerment and providing value in the fintech space the advent of blockchain tech has increased that capability  and represents a generational disruption across all the industries that can benefit from distributed ledger technology i’m excited to be among those leading the chargeblockchain is truly novel there are things you can do with blockchain that you just can’t do with any other technologythe things you can do only with blockchain technology have one thing in common and that is the empowerment of the individual and democratization of transactional activities whether that be in logistics finance communications etcthe simple truth is that blockchain technology is a  order paradigm shifting technology if it is a “ponzi scheme” as detractors assert then it is the second longest running and most popular ponzi scheme of all time what holds first place chart belowthomas carter founder and chairman of dealbox inc read about thomas “this fintech veteran is making
