if you’re reading this you’ve most likely read other articles regarding how “bad” bitcoin btc has become for the environment but really how much worse is it than traditional bankingfiat and can we do better hint the answer is yeseditors note “for transparency – the pivx project is community run and managed – by a dao decentralized autonomous organization this is not an endorsement of daos which can behave very differently”here’s what we’re going to cover and discusshow much energy does it take to mine bitcoinhow much energy is needed to support banking as you use it todaywe’re also going to introduce you to pivx a financial data protectioncentric coin that uses millions of percent less energy to maintain the global network than either of thesewhat are the corresponding carbon emission rates for all threegrowing up in the suburbs north of seattle i recall my grandfather telling me “… there’s no such thing as free money” like most anything worthwhile in this world there’s a cost associated with “things” even if you don’t see it while cryptocurrency investors specifically those with an eye for bitcoin continue to purchase the coin at alltimehigh prices some prefer to mine their coins which costs nothing more than setting up an expensive computer for a few hundred or thousandsand while most people work for their hardearned money have you ever thought about what it takes to produce manage and store that money specifically what are the electrical needs for all of that infrastructurethis article is broken down into two partsfirst  we’re going to talk about the nontechnical aspects of what it takes to produce bitcoin manage fiat regular money as we know it and create pivx a userprivacy protecting cryptocurrency project then if you’re still up for it we’re going to talk about the nontechnical aspects of what it takes to produce bitcoin manage fiat regular money as we know it and create pivx a userprivacy protecting cryptocurrency project then if you’re still up for it continue reading the second part where we look at the numbers to produce the outcomes for part one and the environmental impacts as measured by  emissionssome of the information in the second part is redundant but necessary for the point it’s almost like a moneycentric “choose your adventure”where we are in shortas noted in the opening there’s little love for the electricity used by bitcoin and while the media’s focus is on bitcoin the same issues could be said of all proof of work projects like ethereum or litecoin in general you need only do your own research dyor on the subject to see the outcryhere’s the first thing you may see if you search it“mining” for the cryptocurrency is powerhungry involving heavy computer calculations to verify transactions cambridge researchers say it consumes around  terawatthours twh a year – and is unlikely to fall unless the value of the currency slumpsof note is the amount of electricity it takes right now over  terawatthours per year to put that little number in perspective for you where i live that’ll cost you  at  per watthour for of mining mining is expensive no doubt it gets worse thoughunless you’re living off the grid and storing your cash in your mattress i applaud you if you are you’re probably using a bank to manage or keep your money i do it’s part of life as we know it however in doing so i too am part of a problem a problem that far exceeds any issues we may have with bitcoin’s power issuesthe global banking system as of a  study used more than  terawatthours per year figure  i need not run the math on this one it’s safe to say it’s worse if not much worse than bitcoin et al and that’s just the energy required to keep the “digital” side of the system afloat you can begin to easily tack on more terawatthours per year when you consider the energy needed to create the paper or coin elements of currency shipping transportation and the like the question you need to ask yourself is why doesn’t anyone talk about thisthe answer is pretty easy to comprehend the status quo is to put your money into the banking system it’s a thing that ordinary people do many of these same people also question bitcoin and cryptocurrency writ large as unnecessary because we have banks and while this may sound like a copout answer the truth is until your average grandmother can buyobtain store and use cryptocurrency as they do with their bank the status quo shall remainto further complicate the environmental aspect of this is a recent report published by the rainforest action network within you’ll find that from  through today  of the world’s largest banks have poured nearly  trillion into the fossil fuel industry this only exacerbated the very issues we’re trying to solvethe thing that bitcoin or the dream of bitcoin or cryptocurrencies at large provides is an unparalleled opportunity for humanity to redefine and alter the fundamental framework of money itself for the first time in known history we possess the ability to jumpstart a renaissance of local digital currency systems social coordination and programmable money and assets this is indeed something incredible unto itself and you might argue worth the energy demands while certainly bitcoin opened that door it’s time we went through it and deeper into what is truly possible with distributed ledger technology and cryptocurrencies that could benefit the earth’s environment our home as well as our pocketsenter pivxi liken pivx to what banks strive to be but can’t a system where a user has total control over their money don’t want anyone to know how much money you have in the bank with pivx you can do that want to send an undisclosed amount of money to your sister you can do that too you can protect the data about where the money comes from where it’s going and how much is moved need to pay a bill using a system that conforms to government antimoney laundering laws think wire transfers pivx can do that tooall of this can be done from your desktop computer today and soon from your phone oh wait did i mention that running the entire global network only costs  in annual energy costs figure  even better pivx’s global network is  million times less expensive to run than bitcoin’s that my friends is a lot of saved energynow one argument might be put forward about pivx in that its current transactional volume is a fraction of bitcoins and this is why it has a lower energy cost than bitcoin if pivx was a proof of work cryptocurrency like bitcoin this might be true however the beautiful nature of pivx is that it can continue to scale to meet a rising transactional volume demand with minimal if no change in its energy consumption how is this possible the pivx network does not demand or require energy demanding computational devices to try and out compete other nodes in the network instead lowpowered globally distributed nodes all contribute and cooperate together to validate secure and protect the network thus if pivx was processing the same amount of transactions as bitcoin today the power use and cost would barely movei should also note that i calculated the numbers for pivx based on the average desktop computer’s energy consumption however the nodes can be run on a microcomputer eg raspberry pi given a mix of  regular and microcomputers this annual cost drops to  millionannually if they were all raspberry pi computers that number would only be  millionannually you can’t mine bitcoin or run the world’s banking system on a raspberry pi but you can maintain the pivx network while being your own bank oh and you can earn more pivx just by saving your pivx in your wallet… no i’m not kiddingi’m pretty confident that the point’s made for the everyday person it takes a significant amount of electricity to maintain the global financial system and not much less to mine bitcoin while a single btc is worth a considerable amount today it doesn’t offer much bang for the creation buckwhile bitcoin is the grandfather of the cryptocurrency world thank you btc we can do better today it’s hard to argue that pivx isn’t that answer the team behind the project is everevolving the protocols while i dare not say they’re working to futureproof it it’s pretty damn closepart the cost of bitcoinspecific to btc while a mining setup can be expensive for an individual it can pale compared to the longterm cost to run the said machine according to cryptocompare it costs about  a year for a single device to mine  of a single bitcoin given that it’ll cost a single machine  to mint a single bitcoin however the more likely scenario here is that it will take about  devices running  to complete the task in a yearwhile you may think this isn’t too bad of a profit and it’s not at first blush the issue arises when you factor in farms these are operations that run hundreds or even thousands of highend machines the largest farm can mine about  bitcoins a month in a year that single farm will spend  in electricity to mine approximately  bitcoin with a current worth of  million this is only one operation and there are hundreds of such farms around the worldthe cost in energy converted to actual energy used to mint bitcoins worldwide is now more than entire countries and has been for years a paper on interestingengineering notes“cambridge researchers say cryptocurrency “mining” for bitcoin — which uses heavy computer calculations to verify transactions — consumes around  terawatthours twh a year“using an analysis tool that generates energy estimates for cryptocurrencies the team of researchers ranked bitcoin’s electricity consumption above argentina  twh the netherlands  twh and the united arab emirates  twh — and they say it is close to reaching the consumption levels of norway  twh”another estimate shows this consumption as low as  twh in january of  either way this paper cites that it costs roughly  million per day to mine bitcoin ouchhere’s yet another perspective on the issue this  paper on the global electrical costs of bitcoin shows calculation that it took  gigawatts of power the same as ireland’s entire national usage earlier this year  bitcoin energy usage surpassed that of argentina tooas we’ve already been using terawatts a conversion from  gigawatts is  terawatts thus from  to  the global usage of electricity for mining bitcoin has risen by over  to   –    x  depending on which calculation you take for today’s amount the point is the cost isn’t going to decrease any time soonthere is a growing trend among the bitcoin community who mine to seek alternative energy use methods thus while still a massive consumer of energy bitcoin appears to have a trend of pushing energy usage into a cleaner production sectorthe cost of fiat  bankingfiat is anything declared by a government to be legal tender in most cases it’s papercoins printed by said government to better define fiat it’s something that you or i can give the government to either pay off debt or pay taxes you can’t do either of these directly with cryptocurrency yet however if the city government of miami florida gets its way cryptocurrency will soon be an option for paying billswith that noted have you ever wondered how much it costs to make money used as fiat i hadn’t really until writing this i did however know that it cost more than  to make a penny let’s learni originally went into writing about how much it costs to produce the same amount of us dollars as a single bitcoin however i don’t have the patience to wait for a redacted copy of government records which can take months to getinstead let’s look at this as a global issue which indeed it is in short bitcoin pales in comparison to how much it costs to produce and manage banknotesin a  article it was estimated that the global banking industry uses around  twh of power annually to maintain their physical locations buildings servers atms etc another report this one from  notes that it took  twh of electricity and  billion with a “b” gallons of water annually to produce banknotes don’t forget the paper ink linen etc figure so if we want to compare some elements bitcoin is currently a less energyconsuming alternative to traditional banks traditional banks have the bloat and burden of this “physical” item notes dollars coins paper etc that consume untold amounts of energy plus the digital infrastructure required for a “modern” age bitcoin in cutting out the middleman as it were is a less energyconsuming alternative albeit it’s still a massive energy hogthe cost of pivwhile bitcoin and fiat regular money are well known worldwide i’m here to bring something new into your lives pivx these four letters stand for protected instant verified transaction xthrough the years using cryptocurrency has been compared to being one’s own bank to a degree if your money is in a bank you want your funds to be secure and private there is no reason for people to know how much money one might have in the bank pivx can do this and more the best part of all it’s no more difficult to obtainconvert funds into pivx than it is for bitcoin ethereum or cardanoif you’re interested read up on the project or visit the team on discord and ask direct questionsfirst things first let’s discuss the energy impact of pivx where bitcoin uses a coin minting standard called proof of work pow surmised above as energy inefficient as it takes a lot of energy to solve the required math pivx uses a standard called proof of stake pos and it’s much more energyefficient using pos reduces the energy needed to mint new coins and maintain the network’s node integritywhere pow coins such as bitcoin require specialized computers to make it worthwhile the pos method used with pivx allows node owners to use nearly any computer yes even a raspberry pigiven that i want to showcase how little energy it takes to run a pivx node and its underlying network i’m using the raspberry pi rpi  for the example at a published rate using  the rpi is indeed a costconscious computer i run four in my house as various servers however we’ll assume it’s a standard rpi with no extra wizbang items attached for use as a node where i live north of seattle the power company charges a little more than  cents per kilowatthour kwh if the machine is powered  it is it will roughly use  kwhday to the tune of  kwhyear at  cents per kwh i’m spending  annuallyto keep this somewhat accurate let’s say nodes will also be regular pcs doctor google gives an average watthour of  for a desktop computer annual power usage would be  kwhyear and an operating cost of we have known numbers of a particular type of node on the pivx system today  what’s unknown is the number of nodes not running as masternodes for argument’s sake let’s assume there are another  nodes keeping this fair we’ll turn those  nodes’ energy consumption of  kwhyear cost number of nodes multiplied by the pcs kwhannual to twh terawatts as used for bitcoin and banks above figure  i’m also rounding because when you’re talking about such a small number yes  million kwh is minor the math gets funky however for argument’s sake  million kwh equates to  twh so we’ll just round to  twhas a side note and as you’ve decided to read into the numbers i also want to highlight the cold staking functionality of pivx’s wallets you can delegate your pivx coins while still holding on to your keys i stake mine from my ledger nano and you’ll still receive your staking rewards it’s just another method allowing you to remain in control of your money essentially this means you don’t have to have your walletnodecomputer running  to reap the benefits of the systema comparison of the three figure fiat banking  twh annually  to run physical locationsbitcoin mining  –  twh annually pivx  twh annually   rpipc is  twh annually all rpi is  twh annuallyconceptually this might be hard to grasp so let’s expand on this a bit further the average american home consumes  kwhyear of energy using our calculations from above that means that the legacy banking ecosystem consumes the power equivalency to that of more than  million homes bitcoin not much better it consumes power equivalent to more than  million homeswhere does pivx come in on its energy use just  homes worth figure  that’s a single neighborhood in some places that means for the power it takes to energize  homes you can have a network that can do everything and more than bitcoin by design pivx is faster more efficient rewards anyone who participates and best of all preserves and protects your financial dataenvironmental impact  significanceso what does this mean for the environment and the planet that we live onwell the current banking ecosystem is atrocious for the environment the energy used is immense resulting in  lbs of  every year  million metric tons of  that’s roughly  of the total  emissions in the usa annuallyhow about bitcoin the energy it requires results in  lbs of  every year  million metric tons of  again that’s still roughly  of the total  emission in the usa annually not that much better than cashso how does pivx fare then well the energy pivx requires results in  lbs of  every year  metric tons of  that’s roughly  of the  emission in the usa it’s not nothing however but for a system that can support a global financial ecosystem well now we’re talking efficiency and environmentally friendly figure   figure pivx has already delivered a webbased wallet accessible via any browser even mobile soon this wallet will also permit offline or “coldstaking” meaning anyone anywhere in the world with a phone capable of accessing the internet can participate in the pivx ecosystem transact and earnwrapping upwe’re just a group of people who are conscious of power choices more so now what we hope we’ve been able to share with you is how expensive and powerhungry money is we have a choice and given the nature of money it’s always going to be a personal choice until the government says otherwise—time to make yoursif you have any questions or burning desires to learn more i suggest you check out pivx’s and bitcoin’s
