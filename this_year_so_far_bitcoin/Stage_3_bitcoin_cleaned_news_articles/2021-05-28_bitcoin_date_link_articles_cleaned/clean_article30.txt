if a client or prospect brings up crypto it is simply in the openended question of what do you think about bitcoincrypto i tell them that i consider it a volatile and speculative place to put moneymy investing philosophy is built around investments that we can reasonably predict and expect a return from when you buy a stock you get the future cash flow that the company generates when you buy a bond you receive interest payments when you buy crypto your sole source of a return is betting that someone else will be willing to pay more for that digital currency in the future than you did maybe they will but im not willing to bet my familys or my clients futures on such an unpredictable outcome— matt elliott pulse financial planning rochester minnesotai have had a few clients ask me about cryptocurrency the first thing they ask is “what is it” and then they want to know if we are investing in it or if they should invest in it oftentimes these are people who are very risk averse but no one wants to miss out on the next hottest thing i remind them about the volatility of these assets and tell them if they would like to invest some of their money in crypto it should be money they arent counting on for retirement or their other goals they should only invest their “mad” money— monica dwyer harvest financial advisors west chester ohiomany clients are asking about crypto assets i explain that crypto assets still appear to be speculative in nature i am not recommending crypto assets be part of their core longterm investment portfolios however they are welcome to create or add to a side account they might have for speculative holdings specifically it should be money they can afford to lose i am also reminding them to account for any cryptorelated realized gains whether they self prepare their income taxes or work with a tax professional— michael palazzolo fintentional llc birmingham michigani have conversations weekly regarding crypto as a handful of my clients are crypto millionairestypically the meetings revolve around a couple topics balancing net worth between crypto and traditional assets and income tax planning the tax conversations can be very strategic as typically we only look to sell longterm capital gains but with the volatility of the asset class there is opportunity to tax loss harvest as wellover the last few months i’ve also had clients pull money out of their coinbase accounts in order to purchase a home really it is the same conversations i have with traditional clients just with a more aggressive timeline— blake hempel hempel wealth management chicagoplenty of my clients have asked about cryptos and whether or not they should invest i have explained to my clients that i view crypto as gambling and not investing  i ask them about what they haven’t thought about do they have an objective trading plan a sell price the vast majority of people have no idea how it’s being pricedclients ask me why i dont like crypto … ultimately i explain to them that even though cryptocurrency might be theoretically possible this doesnt change the fact that its a madeup currencyasset that isnt backed by anythingthere is no reason to believe a cryptocurrency value will consistently rise over time even bitcoin is not a safe haven when the market is down if anything it’s more correlated to highflying tech names i tell clients i will invest in bitcoin on your behalf it’s not something i believe in you can do it on your own against my recommendation— michael caligiuri caligiuri financial columbus ohiowe have been asked recently about crypto assets ironically the only question people seem to be asking is “how do i buy it” nobody is asking “should i buy it” or “what are the risks”the reality is there are indeed risks this asset class is new and volatile will it be regulated and if so how the sec has yet to approve any crypto etfs even though they’ve been asked to for years what we tell clients is to take care of their basics first much like using your salary to pay your rent and buy food and clothes before you go out on the town and splurge make sure you have assessed your risk tolerance and have invested accordingly in a diversified portfoliobeyond that we wouldn’t recommend any more than  total in ‘speculative investments’ which could include crypto or any other currencies art or in some cases real estate you need to be ok with the possibility that you may lose your entire investment also to this point most advisors cannot buy crypto for clients— brad wright launch financial planning andover massachusettsi

have been many times over the past  years when it went down  or more i tells them it can get cut in half or more on its way to going higher and to expect an extremely volatile ride over long periods of time i think it will do well— marc schindler pivot point advisors bellaire texasgovernments are experimenting with digital currencies when they enter the market they will blow away the “private”
