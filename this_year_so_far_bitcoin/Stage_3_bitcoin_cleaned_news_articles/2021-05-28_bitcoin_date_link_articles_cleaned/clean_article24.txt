for the past few days the price of bitcoin has been consolidating after a monumental correction reaching the local low at  many onchain analysis indicators also recorded significant declines going back to levels from before this year’s runin today’s analysis we present five onchain indicators that are now recording levels of support that played important roles in previous bull markets in this way they provide arguments for the thesis that a deeper correction occurs around the middle of the bull market the integrity of which remains intactbitcoin price actionthe price of bitcoin has been consolidating since it experienced a monumental correction on may  and dropped to  the decline was a record at  for this cycle measured from the alltime high at bitcoin chart by tradingviewsince then the price has respected the extensive range of  –  over the past week bitcoin has stabilized tested the  resistance level twice and is currently hovering around the  levelthere are discussions about whether such a deep correction is a signal of the end of the cryptocurrency bull run or if looking at the current market condition it can be considered a “healthy correction” for the overheated bull marketthe indicators of the onchain analysis presented below seem to support the latter option and suggest that we are just in the middle of the bull market in this cyclethree indicators one storythe first three longterm onchain indicators give very similar signals percent supply in profit mvrv and realized profitloss ratio all of them are currently at levels that were crucial to hold in the middle of both previous cycles  and their charts contain three common featurescorrections from local peaks in the  cycle reached the current level green circles corrections from local peaks in the  cycle reached the current level green circles the bull market in  started at the current level blue circlessupply in profitstory continuesthe first indicator is the percent supply in profit this metric determines the percentage of circulating coins in profit ie the percentage of existing coins whose price at the time they last moved was lower than the current pricepercent supply in profit  źródło glassnodecurrently around  of bitcoins are in profit compared to the price at which they were purchased this value was hit several times after the first local peak in  it also held twice as a support after corrections between may and august  green circlesthe last time we recorded such a value several times was during the long threemonth consolidation between may and july  blue circlemvrvthe second indicator that tells a similar story is mvrv which is the ratio between market capitalization and realized capitalization it gives information about when the price is below its “fair value” ie below onemvrv  źródło glassnodeduring the current correction the mvrv approached the value of  where it dropped during the corrections of the previous cycles green circles in both cases it was around the middle of the bull market followed by an exponential phase of growththe current bull market also started at this level when after the aforementioned threemonth consolidation the btc price moved towards new highsrealized profitlossfinally the third example of our onchain analysis pattern is the  average of realized profitloss ratio it is the ratio between all coins moved at a profit and a lossrealized profitloss ratio  source glassnodethe current value of this indicator is around  signifying a slight loss in the market the longterm chart shows two bullish retests of this level in the previous two cycles green circlesin the  cycle the first retest took place before the first peak and the second after it in the  cycle both took place more or less in the middle of the bull market this was before the main phase of growth but also before the breakthrough of the previous athinterestingly in the case of this indicator we also had a retest of this level during the btc correction in september  it happened as bitcoin validated its previous resistance around  as supportadditional arguments rhodl and puell multipletwo more indicators of onchain analysis can reinforce our narrative about the middle of the current bull market the first is the realized hodl ratio it uses a realized cap hodl waves ratio and helps indicate an overheated market and possible macro peaksrealized hodl ration  source glassnodethe current value of this indicator fluctuates around  the sinusoidal chart is very similar to the movement from the middle of the  cycle green circle where after a strong increase we had an extended consolidationthis region was also significant in the late phase of the  cycle blue circle however its breakthrough quickly led to the last phase of the bull marketfinally the last element of onchain analysis that provides arguments for the middle of the current run is the famous puell multiple it is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of bitcoins by the  moving average of daily issuance valuethis indicator helped determine the previous macro tops for bitcoin that occurred when puell multiple hit the red region above  today its value is just  and has dropped to late  levelspuell multiple  source glassnodeinterestingly in the  cycle we have not reached such a low level after the first peak however four years later this area turned out to be important twicewhat is more it was even lost once in  for several months and regained after nevertheless it was again recorded around the middle of the cycle and its retest allowed for a much higher btc value at the peak of the bull marketconclusionin the above analysis we presented five longterm indicators of onchain analysis they all provide arguments in favor of the thesis that the ongoing bitcoin correction occurs about halfway through the current bull marketif these levels are maintained – as in the  and  cycles – the next months may bring a strong continuation of the run and a journey towards new alltime highs for btcfor beincrypto’s latest bitcoin btc analysis click here
