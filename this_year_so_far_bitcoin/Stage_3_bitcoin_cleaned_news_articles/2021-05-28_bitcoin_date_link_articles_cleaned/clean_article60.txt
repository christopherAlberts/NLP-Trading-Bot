john vallis will be hosting the bitcoin  conference in miami on june  and  make sure that you set a reminder for the bitcoin  day one youtube live stream and one for the bitcoin  day two youtube live stream nowbitcoin  in miami is less than a week away and i’m excited to see old friends and meet many new faces conference mc john vallis is someone i’m particularly eager to meet and have a conversation withvallis is one of the highestquality podcasters in the bitcoin space with his show “bitcoin rapid fire” he has interviewed bitcoiners of all ages and from all walks of life from plebs to ceos developers sovereign individuals and more running this podcast has changed his life since as he told me he’s finally found his tribe i think many bitcoiners including myself can relateback when i was fairly new to bitcoin twitter vallis was the second bitcoiner to interview me for a podcast it was awesome to sit down and talk about bitcoin life and more with him i really enjoy his outlook and opinions on things and he’s someone i listen to when i’m searching for signal amongst the noisei asked vallis five questions about starting his podcast his experience interviewing bitcoiners finding pure signal the current state of the bull market and what he’s looking forward to most at bitcoin  see below for his answers which will allow you to learn more about the man behind the micwhats the story behind starting your podcastits pretty simple really all i could think about was bitcoin and then i somehow stumbled into bitcoin twitter in  and realized there were more like me and i pretty much started it out of necessity to get some of these thoughts out of my head my approach to the podcast has always just been to have open relaxed conversations with people who i find interesting or with whom i share interests i tend to explore the more philosophical or “personal development” aspects that seem to be emerging around bitcoin the best part by far has been connecting with unknown plebs and hearing how meaningful the bitcoin journey has been for them its incredible reallyyou’ve hosted a podcast for many years interviewing people from all backgrounds can you dive into this experience and share how hearing your guests’ different perspectives has impacted your views on life and bitcoinwell for one its been awesome i came to the realization a few years ago that genuine relationships are one of the things i value most in life i love how bitcoin permits and inspires people to be who they really are cause you need both people to be doing that to really “connect” developing relationships with good honest principled dedicated lighthearted ride or die motherfers has been the greatest reward of doing the pod of course having a forum to air out my thoughts and ideas and mix them with those of my guests has been a huge asset in helping me to refine my thinking as far as how its impacted my life its changed everything man not so much diet and lifestyle stuff that was always pretty on point but i just feel like i found my people and they all see a similar vision for the world and are passionately pursuing it its insane how good that feels to be a part ofi know you are all about truth freedom and asking questions in order to figure out why things are the way they are in the current world with so much noise and virtue signalling surrounding people how do people find pure signal and where do they go from theretough question man its no small task to “see truth” so much can cloud up our ability to do so my whole life ive been trying to see things clearly and prior to bitcoin that pursuit didnt always lead me to the most positive of realizations that said my attitude has always been that “id rather be tormented by the truth than coddled by ignorance” i dont think you can instill that kind of pursuit in someone they either have it or they dont youve got to at least be curious i think that characterizes a lot of bitcoiners if you keep asking questions youve got to arrive at the truth at some point right and i genuinely believe that bitcoin is a profound form of truth one which we are only just beginning to understand in fact i think we are acting out the truth of it even more than we are consciously comprehending or engaging it hence the “transformation” phenomenon and my interest in exploring it on the pod so in a world full of noise bitcoin is the pure signal they should be following from there you effectively become an alchemist you use your exploration and refinement of your understanding of the truth of the object to facilitate the same process in yourself i struggle to see a more worthwhile pursuit in the face of what my friend erik cason describes as an “ontological” object bitcoin “stranger than we can suppose”what do you think about the current state of the bull market ongoing fud and the supply of bitcoin getting eaten up by plebs and now institutional playersi give less and less of my attention to the markets and all the fud and shenanigans man dont get me wrong its sometimes fun and exciting and all that but i just care less and less ive made my mind up bitcoin is it its so much bigger than most people think id rather spend my time furthering my understanding or mixing it up and smashing ideas together with other bitcoiners than worrying what the decrepit fiat world is up to the more cheap corn the plebs can scoop up the betteryoull be mc’ing bitcoin  in a few weeks what do you look forward to most about this gatheringim super pumped about helping to mc bitcoin  and thanks to the crew at bitcoin mag for the invite im most excited about meeting and hanging out with everyone i think the energy there is going to be insane with everything thats happened in bitcoin
