methods with solutionsargo blockchain solutions teamed up with dmg blockchain solutions to create the first bitcoin mining pool that runs entirely off clean energy the initiative uses hydroelectric power to mine and therefore creates a “green bitcoin”another collaboration was agreed upon between wesco operating inc and ez blockchain they’ve created a way to capture energy from gas flares to power mining mining operations moved onsite thanks to ez smartgrid technology and used the electricity converted from flared gasthe future of bitcoin relies on adoption and environmental concerns could harm this going forward how the community shifts will be key to determining bitcoins future
