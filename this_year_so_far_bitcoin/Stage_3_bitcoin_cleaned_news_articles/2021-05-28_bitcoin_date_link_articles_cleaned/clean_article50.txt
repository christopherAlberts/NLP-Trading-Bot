cryptocurrency and its mostnoted asset bitcoin has been breaking into the mainstream press while most lawyers have heard terms like “blockchain” and probably even know a few people who have been deeply interested in the world of cryptocurrency far more of us have at best a vague understanding of crypto markets and how crypto is acquired traded and converted to everyday dollars or fiat currency given that the price of a bitcoin is up over  since april  and approximately  per coin at the time of writing the incentive to pay attention has increased what was once thought to be a solely a niche product is becoming more widely accepted as evidenced by an recent article in forbes estimating that  of stimulus funds or  billion will be used to purchase bitcoingiven this rapid expansion of interest and participation in cryptocurrency transactions it’s not a matter of whether you have an interest in crypto think it’s all a bizarre technobubble the eventual replacement for fiat currency or somewhere in between the fact of the matter is your clients and future clients are more likely than ever to have a connection to this market and a brief review of the headlines can make this prospect seem terrifyingfederal prosecutorial activitytype “bitcoin” into the search bar on the united states department of justice website and you come up with over  hits a scan of which will be heartburninducing for criminal defense lawyers “money laundering” “child exploitation” “terrorist financing” “dark web” “narcotics” and “ponzi scheme” are all terms you will encounter in the first few pages of results click through to the press releases of various arrests prosecutions and plea bargains and it becomes clear that there are some criminal elements particularly abroad that have an affinity for using cryptocurrency in attempts to transact illicit businessit is undeniable that early in the history of cryptocurrency those looking to evade legal and compliance measures were attracted by the anonymity of crypto transactions which did not require routing through traditional highlyregulated financial institutions such as banks and brokerages that have welldeveloped antimoney laundering aml and knowyourcustomer kyc programs office of foreign asset control ofac compliance units and generate suspicious activity reports sars for the us treasurythe situation today is more complicated nfl players corporate ceos and entertainers openly touting their most recent bitcoin purchase on social media are clearly not looking for anonymity with respect to their bitcoin or crypto transactions and traditional financial institutions are presumably getting in on the crypto craze for reasons other than terrorist financing or dark web narcotics purchases from an enforcement and prosecution perspective there is a still a working suspicion if not a presumption among some prosecutors and regulators that crypto transactions are suspect in and of themselves “really” they think “if this was on the upandup why didn’t this transaction go through the bank” or “what’s wrong with a wire transfer”it is undeniable that early in the history of cryptocurrency those looking to evade legal and compliance measures were attracted by the anonymity of crypto transactions which did not require routing through traditional highlyregulated financial institutions such as banks and brokerages that have welldeveloped antimoney laundering aml and knowyourcustomer kyc programs office of foreign asset control ofac compliance units and generate suspicious activity reports sars for the us treasury the situation today is more complicatedwhat is the government worried aboutthe traditional financial services industry is both a highlyregulated industry in its own right but also a de facto partner of federal law enforcement without which entire regulatory and enforcement regimes arguably become ineffective for example if i deposit  in cash in my checking account through a teller window my bank will generate a sar for the us department of treasury noting that transaction the transaction may or may not generate questions or enforcement activity but the bank knows to be on heightened alert for large cash transactions and its own internal compliance systems will kick in to ask me questions have me fill out forms etc similarly if i walk into my bank and want to wire a significant amount of money to uzbekistan i will be questioned about the transaction all parties will be run through an ofac database to ensure that parties barred from the us financial system are not involved and regardless of any actually illegality of transaction the bank may decline to process it simply based on “risk”these examples get to the core of the government’s concern with certain crypto transactions and platforms financial services businesses behave the way they do because of the obligations imposed by the bank secrecy act  usc §§ et seq and because they are money services businesses and thus governed by certain reporting requirements see  cfr § ff these laws and regulations though financial in nature exist to prevent money laundering of the proceeds of substantive crimes such as drug or gun running human trafficking or terrorism in theory if an illegal narcotics dealer walked to a bank with  in cash proceeds of drug transactions the bank would let the government know about the cash deposit questions would be asked and the substantive crime of drug dealing thwarted if the bank stayed silent it would face legal trouble for violating its obligations under the bsain this context it is easy to see the government’s concern with crypto transactions and platforms that evade this regulatory structure in its entirety for the purpose of facilitating criminal activity it is also easy to understand the fear of government regulators regarding the development of an entirely new digital currency or asset class that doesn’t fit well within existing systemshow does this apply to my clientshappily it need not the “wild west” aspect of crypto particularly in the united states is being reined in and plenty of legitimate avenues exist for the curious to try their hand in the crypto market at this point many major usbased platforms established to buy sell or trade bitcoin and other crypto assets in a “digital wallet” have registered as “money services businesses” have full “know your customer” protocols and other compliance you are familiar with from your bank and file sars with treasury as a bank would thus if your client’s interest is in acquiring some bitcoin and seeing if it goes up another  this year there are plenty of options to do so legitimately granted tax and other obligations remain and a tax lawyer would need to be consulted regarding recognition of gains etcof course not every client may be of the “buy and hold” variety what if your client has a more active transactional relationship with crypto is that a sign of troubleat this point many major usbased platforms established to buy sell or trade bitcoin and other crypto assets in a “digital wallet” have registered as “money services businesses” have full “know your customer” protocols and other compliance you are familiar with from your bank and file sars with treasury as a bank wouldsome legitimate business cases for using cryptobeyond novelty or “value store” uses of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies there are increasing legitimate transactional uses of cryptocurrencies particularly in the international arena for example in some populations crypto can be a more efficient way for small dollar and possibly even unbanked users to handle remittances from the us to a home country some businesses now “trade” payment of local invoices in local currency for bitcoin on ebaylike platforms as an alternative to wire transfers for crossborder transactions bitcoin though volatile can also be a store of value in countries where hyperinflation is an issue this list is not meant to be exhaustive but simply to note that contra the view of some mere involvement in crossborder crypto transactions is not a clear sign of money laundering or other illicit activityjust as with a “buy and hold” client for legitimate users there are plenty of legitimate options in the us that are registered with the appropriate authorities and can help facilitate various crypto transactions of course they will require traditional kyc documentation and will keep records of the transactions that will be available to authorities as always if the client is reluctant to use these options because of these requirements ask whywhere is the troublethe forgoing should put most lawyers at ease about their clients’ crypto activities so where are the “parade of horribles” on doj’s website originating it is valuable to review the categories of cases that have created headlines as doing so makes it relatively clear that market makers trading platforms and peer

presents fraudsters with ample opportunity to defraud unknowing investors and the doj has taken a deep interest in these scams bitclub serves as a prime example the “bitclub network” solicited money from investors in exchange for shares of pooled investments in cryptocurrency mining that rewarded existing investors for recruiting new investors as a result bitclub’s operators were charged with knowingly and intentionally conspiring to devise a scheme to defraud and to obtain money and property from victims by false pretensesthe bottom linethe crypto age is upon us even if you don’t care or understand much about it some of your clients will although regulatory clarity is well behind traditional financial services there are plenty of legitimate players in the market at this point as the us regulatory regime has adapted if your client for some reason wants out of that regime ask yourself why and make sure you are comfortable with the reasoning the ultimate risk is that anonymity or other irregular aspects to a transaction result in your client having facilitated a serious crime or participated in money laundering activity as discussed above however for typical users particularly new entrants to the crypto world there are plenty of legitimate and legally safe platforms to dip your toe into the crypto watersthis article originally appeared in business crimes bulletin vol  no  ©
