from today january   africa is ushering in a new economic era with the implementation of the african continental free trade area afcfta agreement the agreement was to be implemented in july  but was suspended because of the global pandemicseveral pundits and major organisations have lauded the initiative but it presents tough questions for policymakers and huge opportunities for startups and innovators in africawhat is the afcfta agreementthe afcfta agreement is a pact that involves the  member states of the african union looking to create a single continentwide market for goods and services and facilitate capital movementadvertisementthe african union au adopted and opened up the afcfta agreement for signature on march   besides eritrea all member states have duly signed and ratified the pact thus making it set to be the world’s largest free trade areabesides afcfta several treaties and agreements exist in different parts of africa we have the east african community eac the economic community of west african states ecowas and the common market for eastern and southern africa comesa to mention a fewtiti akinsanmi a digital economy and policy expert explains that the free trade agreement was an extension of existing treaties and agreements between african countries“you can trace them as far as the southern african customs union sacu agreement of  to more recent ones like the kigali declaration it’s all part of the au’s agenda for ” she saysaccording to akinsanmi the new free trade area’s existence does not negate the relevance of the previous agreements but rather improves them and creates new opportunitieswhat problem is afcfta trying to solvethe afcfta is looking to boost several segments of the economy including intraregional trade within africa and the production of madeinafrica goods and services among othersthe african export–import bank afreximbank stated that only  of africa’s exports went to other african countries in  the continent remains a major supplier of primary goods to nonafrican countries and an importer of processed and manufactured productsadvertisementaccording to the world bank the pact connects  billion people across  countries with a combined gross domestic product gdp valued at  trillion it also claims that it can lift  million people out of extreme poverty and raise the income levels of  million others who live on less than  per dayconsequently among several initiatives the new agreement includes plans tolet products and services be traded dutyfree across africacreate tariff concessions for goods and services moving in and out of africafacilitate payments across the region to promote tradewhat are the issues the afcfta agreement might faceas much as the benefits are being touted the africa free trade agreement’s challenges run deep and signing the new document might just be a drop in the ocean of easing africa’s crossborder tradeandrew nevin fs leader and chief economist pwc west africa argues that the trade agreement’s impact will not be felt overnight for now it would be best to be cautiously optimistic about the impact of the agreement“there are issues around physical and soft infrastructure connecting countries in africa right now it’s much easier to ship by sea we would need better roads and effective rail systems across africa for a more effective trading system” he saysrails are an efficient way of moving vast amounts of goods across long distances but it has witnessed a gradual decline in africa according to the african development bank afdb rail transport’s market share in most african countries accounts for less than  of the total volume of goods transporteddespite recent years’ progress africa’s road network both within and between countries leaves much to be desireddeepening internet connectivity easing crossborder payments creating digital identities and improving africa’s addressing system has remained a challengebesides infrastructure nevin insists that each country would have to harmonise several policies to a unified standard“if you produce a product or service ai essay writer that satisfies the standards organisation of nigeria son it has to be the accepted standard for other countries to ease economic transactions ultimately the afcfta agreement will take a lot of goodwill from member states” he explainsfor west africa nevin argues that relations might continue to be handicapped by the language barriers between francophone and anglophone west africaalso some african countries are historically territorial south africa has battled with long with xenophobia nigeria’s borders are closed despite the prospect of a free trade treaty and kenya wants its citizens to hold significant equity in ict companies operating in the countrywhat are the opportunities for startupsthe free trade agreement’s implementation is expected to increase foreign direct investments and by extension startup funding in africa however the issues that could arise from its implementation present different kinds of openingsakinsanmi opines that technology would need to be employed for several new agreement features to come into effect the new agreement opens up a wealth of opportunities from fintech companies and techenabled logistics and distribution platforms to the entertainment industry“crossborder payments already happen in africa so what’s required now is to build upon the existing infrastructure and make it less onerous to send money from one african country to another” she states“the banks have done quite well but the next stage might just be for the disruptors like paystack and flutterwave to further deepen africa’s payment infrastructure”in  bitcoin adoption surged massively in response to  and it is expected that this could drive down remittance cost so far people have responded to failing currencies and unstable economies by opting for decentralised financeaccording to akinsanmi despite the threat of territorial governments coming up with unfavourable policies startups can decide to expand to other countries by weighing the potential economic benefits of such moveshow soon might we see the benefitsit might take a long time for african countries to reap the benefits of the afcfta agreement and nevin believes every interested party should not overreact in the short term“i think the agreement is important but it’s a long term vision for  what african governments should be doing right now is focusing on the fundamentals improving good governance the roads rails payment systems and connectivity“no matter how the trade agreement turns out we’re going to need those infrastructures anyway” he addsas we’ve pointed out in several articles many policies introduced by african governments usually lack the requisite infrastructure to facilitate implementationbesides there are also issues with soft infrastructure and the lack of a central database in most countries is still a glaring issuethough some might argue that the data is not available akinsanmi argues that nearly everyone gets captured either through the birth certificates in the hospital the national census sim registrations or some other agency despite the absence of a central database“what we lack so far is cohesiveness with the capturing of this data and that has to be resolved”the afcfta agreement might be implemented in january  but african countries could remain a long way from reaping its benefits if the infrastructure is not in place nevertheless startups will continue to innovate
