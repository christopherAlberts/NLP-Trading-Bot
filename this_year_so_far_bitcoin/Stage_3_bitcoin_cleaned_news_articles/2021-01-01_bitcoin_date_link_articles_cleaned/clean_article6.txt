why the  vaccine distribution has gotten off to a slow startthe rollout of vaccines for  has been slower than expected reasons include local logistics lack of funding and staffing struggles during the winter holidaysleila fadel hostthe campaign to vaccinate americans against  is getting off to a slower start than officials had hoped  much slower heres a key number  in recent weeks about  million people received their first shots of the pfizer and moderna vaccines but thats far short of what officials had forecast  that  million americans would be vaccinated by now joining us to talk about what it will take to speed up the process is npr science correspondent richard harris hey richardrichard harris byline hey happy new year to youfadel happy new year so richard i was hoping in the new year you were here to tell us the vaccines will soon be readily available but it sounds like the country is far short of that forecasted  million what happenedharris well there are lots of reasons lets start with expectations the trump administration has long promised quick fixes to the coronavirus pandemic including a vaccine that would be widely available in  and indeed the administration did back an effort that produced vaccines for covid in record time but i spoke yesterday with dr marcus plescia who is the chief medical officer for the association of state and territorial health officials and his take is that the timetable for vaccination was largely aspirationalmarcus plescia we just had a meeting with the majority of our state health officials and you know the feeling from them was that it actually was rolling out quite well you know its only been a couple of weeksharris this is an enormous undertaking it is the most massive vaccination campaign in us history and he says health officials are still very much on the learning curvefadel so what are the challenges theyre running into as they move forwardharris well plescia says for one thing its the holiday season so many overstressed health care workers have been trying to grab a few welldeserved days off but he says the biggest logistical challenge is vaccinating people during a pandemic which means maintaining physical distancing nobody wants to spread  to people standing in line waiting to get vaccinated against the disease and dont forget once people have been vaccinated they have to wait nearby for at least  minutes just in case they have a rare reaction that requires medical attention so you need safe places for people to do that toofadel so lots of logistical challenges but frankly theyve got to pick up the pace of vaccinations if most americans are going to get their shots in the coming months what needs to happenharris right well plescia says he expects the pace to quicken a lot in january after the holidays and as health providers figure out how to optimize their routines but some of this also involves money the federal government has poured billions of dollars into developing manufacturing and distributing these vaccines but it has provided very little funding to local health care workers who had the enormous task of vaccinating people dr howard koh at the harvard chan school of public health says some significant funding to hire new staff to do just that is finally on the way thanks to the covid relief bill that just got signedhoward koh the new congressional package is an excellent downpayment has some  billion out of a  billion relief package to shore up a public health infrastructure thats been hollowed out for far too long but the public health systems at the state and local level need much more support going forward if were going to return to any sense of normal soonharris hes also incensed that some members of the public have been provoked to lash out against public health officials over issues like mask wearing and closing businesses and so on when in fact the public health system is playing such a vital role in helping us through this pandemic giving us these vaccinesfadel right npr science correspondent richard harris thank youharris anytimecopyright ©  npr all rights reserved visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at wwwnprorg for further informationnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by  inc an npr contractor and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future accuracy and availability may vary the authoritative record of npr’s programming is the audio record
