if your desire to mine bitcoin has been thwarted by a lack of gpu stock and flimsy bios locks youtuber stacksmashing may be able to help they’ve made a game boy miner which only needs a game boy console and a slightly modified link cable a raspberry pi pico and a regular computer via tom’s hardwarethe conceit of the project is that all of the mining happens on a stock game boy which was released a full  years before bitcoin was invented of course it does need some help the game boy can’t actually connect to the internet and it can’t hold the entire blockchain to deal with that stacksmashing uses the pico and link cable to connect to the computer which is running a bitcoin node after it’s connected the game boy runs the hashing program from a programmable cartridge and even plays a fun animation while it’s mininggiven that the game boy is slightly slower than today’s dedicated mining machines it apparently runs at  hashes per second while some of the fastest asic miners run  trillion times faster at  terahashes per second it’s astronomically unlikely that stacksmashing would be able to actually mine any bitcoins however when they set up a new bitcoin blockchain with no records on it they were able to confirm that yes the game boy was able to successfully mine blocks who’s ready for gamecoin
