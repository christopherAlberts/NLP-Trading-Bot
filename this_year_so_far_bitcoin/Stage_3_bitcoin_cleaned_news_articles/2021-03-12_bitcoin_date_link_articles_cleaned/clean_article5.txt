cryptocurrencies may be the way of the future at least that’s what many are betting onentrepreneurs and companies are buying selling and investing funds in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin some retailers are accepting payments in cryptocurrency already and most recently miami mayor francis suarez proposed that the city begin using bitcoin for some of its financial transactions including for employee salariesthe popularity of cryptocurrencies is attracting a number of people – including hackers hackers are currently finding lowcost ways to “mine” bitcoin and other cryptocurrency illegally by tapping into everyday people’s computers and using those machines’ resources without their consent the result hackers make millions mining cryptocurrency using other people’s computers meanwhile the victims often find their computers slow down and become impossible to use without realizing what’s going onthis form of hacking – called “cryptojacking” – is happening across the world at astonishing rates miners have not only hacked into regular folks’ computers but they’ve also hacked into major businesses retailers and governmental agencies to use their servers and machines just one example in  the wifi system at a buenos aires starbucks was hacked into to mine cryptocurrency using customers computersfaraz naseem ’ ms ’ is working to find a solution naseem works at fiu’s cyberphysical systems security lab part of the college of engineering and computing under the supervision of the lab’s director selcuk uluagac naseem postdoctoral researcher ahmet aris researcher and lab member leonardo babun ’ ms ’ phd ’ and current electrical and computer engineering master’s student ege tekiner created a novel software to address the problemthe team created a firstofitskind software that detects cryptojacking happening in realtime with an accuracy rate of nearly  percent“we are one of the first in the world to identify cryptojacking” says uluagac who is also an eminent scholarchaired associate professor in the department of electrical and computer engineering and knight foundation school of computing and information sciences “as bitcoin technology becomes more prevalent we will need these types of protections miami is already in the national and international news at the center of bitcoin usage we are becoming a hub for bitcoin so it’s very important that we understand the dangers that come with this and what we can do to solve these problems”the team’s software is a breakthrough in technology according to uluagac other similar applications that are currently in the market to detect cryptojacking require so much of a computer’s central processing unit cpu resources that often the computer slows down immensely and browsing web pages become impossible – not because of cryptojacking happening but because of the application that’s meant to detect itwith the team’s software this problem is completely eliminated“our application stands out from others because it is automated lightweight and instantaneous” naseem explains “it uses less than five percent of cpu it does not affect web browsing at all it also detects cryptojacking within a fraction of a second other detection mechanisms allow the cryptojacking to go on for a while ours doesn’t”the graph above shows how the cpu or computer usage varies when browsing a normal website versus when browsing a cryptojacking websiteone reason the team’s software —named after minos the greek mythological character who had superior judging skills in the underworld—is particular important is because cryptojacking can occur even in the most unlikely ways“cryptojacking is a new kind of threat” aris explains “it often happens when people are just browsing a website that is corrupted maybe even the owner of the website does not know  is using it to mine cryptocurrency”this new type of threat called for a new type of detection mechanism converting malware files and using machine learning to identify corrupt files“i was thinking if we converted these cryptojacking malware files into images we could detect it” naseem says “i tested our hypothesis and saw we had incredibly high accuracy”the team got to work right away conducted research and collected a large data set related to cryptojacking detection just a few months later the team was selected to share its findings virtually at one of the most prestigious cybersecurity conferences in the world the network and distributed system security symposium of at the end of the day all their work says babun is designed to build safeguards for future generations their goal to help create a safer cyberenvironment“we have discovered that cryptojacking is going to be a huge problem in the future” he says “hackers are learning to do these things there is a big need to detect cryptojacking especially as cryptocurrency becomes more and more popular”the team has applied for a patent for the software through fiu and hopes to find a company that may sponsor the product and make it available for everyday people to fight against cryptojacking
