this week two developments point toward continued interest in bitcoin as a medium of exchange the reason the “commerce on the internet” meme may be more accurate than the “digital gold” narrativeone of the developments is the debut of a service allowing use of lightning – a protocol built to scale transactions on the bitcoin blockchain – for payments with online merchants that use the visa network the company behind the service is called moon and it uses a similar mechanism to that used by other bitcoin commerce startups such as foldthe other is paypal’s announcement that it acquired curv an israeli startup developing crypto asset custody technology the paypal announcement which confirmed a coindesk scoop may be more about paypal’s support of bitcoin as an investment but it’s impossible to separate what paypal does from commerce which is the backbone of that companyrelated canaan creative sees miner sales rise amid soaring bitcoin pricesin this article i’ll take a look at two data points one is a metric worth watching as a bellwether for bitcoin’s use in commerce the other is a macroeconomic indicator that can be instructive for those who are confused about whether bitcoin is money or not and highlights one of the ways in which bitcoin is nothing like gold despite the strength of bitcoin’s “digital gold” memelisten digital gold how should financial advisors be thinking about bitcoinlightning network is a layer  protocol that sits atop bitcoin allowing for faster and cheaper transactions the overall capacity of lightning – the bitcoin available for use on the protocol – is a good proxy for interest in using bitcoin for everyday commerceunfortunately for bitcoin’s use in commerce on the internet this metric remains stuck at a ceiling set in related investor discovers beeple nft purchased for  now worth story continuesthe chart shows that as bitcoin has appreciated more dollars are available for lightning transactions but in bitcoin terms capacity is at a ceiling it remains stuck at about  of bitcoin’s freefloat supply a coin metrics measure that counts bitcoin held by addresses active within the past five years a high first reached in march this is fodder for cryptocurrency critics like us treasury secretary janet yellen whose remarks on bitcoin last month gained attention for their focus on crime but were really a slap at bitcoin’s negligible use in commerce “i don’t think that bitcoin … is widely used as a transaction mechanism” she said “to the extent it is used i fear it’s often for illicit finance”read more money reimagined bitcoin’s road to goldthe  bill is not used widely in commerce either the estimated lifespan of the average cnote is  years nearly three times the life of a  “larger denominations such as  notes are often used as a store of value which means they pass between users less frequently than lower denominations” the federal reserve notesthe  bill also gets little use in commercedenomination estimated lifespan   years   years   years   years   years   yearssource us federal reservenonetheless the  bill in the past  years has become the us federal reserve’s most popular paper product as the chart below shows its popularity has grown in  the circulating value of the  bill was  billion about  times that of the  bill twenty years later the fed estimates  trillion worth of  bills in circulation more than seven times that of the commercefriendly  billthe fed’s most popular productbitcoin skeptics who point to its lack of use in commerce are making a mistake comparing bitcoin to the dollar bitcoin is not like the  bill or the  it’s like the  essentially investors are speculating that in the future bitcoin will become like the  an asset held as a bearer instrument and a store of valuein this way bitcoin’s usefulness for “commerce on the internet” remains crucial to its value like the  note bitcoin isn’t valuable necessarily because it is spent but because it could be spent in this way it is unlike gold and in this way lightning’s capacity though limited remains an important data point for bitcoinrelated stories
