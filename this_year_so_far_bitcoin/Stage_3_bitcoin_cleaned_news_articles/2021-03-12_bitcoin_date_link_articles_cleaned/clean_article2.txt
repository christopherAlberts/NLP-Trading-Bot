as the price of bitcoin soars past  the cryptocurrencys negative environmental impact is becoming harder to ignore energyhogging crypto miners have been blamed for power outages in iran while china — a crypto mining hotbed — is cracking down on the practice as it takes a heavier hand with polluting industriesmore such crackdowns may be needed to keep cryptos carbon emissions under control according to research released this week bitcoins recordhigh prices have created a crypto mining backlog such that even if the price falls emissions from mining the virtual currency are likely to stay high for the near futurethe research was published in joule magazine by cryptocurrency economist alex de vries who noted that bitcoins energy use this year will rival that of all data centers globallyits the crazy inefficiency of the system thats jarring de vries saidbitcoins niche appeal is at odds with its massive energy demands de vries explained with bitcoins usage limited to a tiny number of concurrent transactions its not really capable of servicing a big group of people he said despite that it still consumes as much  as all data centers in the world — were talking about all the data centers that are powering the internet powering big tech clouds serving a majority of the worlds population its extremely disproportionalwhile there are only about  million bitcoin miners in the world according to an industry estimate the amount of electricity that mining consumes in one year is equal to that used to power malaysia sweden or ukraine according to the cambridge bitcoin electricity consumption indexlondonscale pollutionwhile its hard to say exactly how carbonintensive cryptocurrency mining is — most miners locations and energy sources are a closely guarded secret — scientists are worried de vries estimates that bitcoins yearly carbon emissions are on track to match the city of londons which is estimated to be  megatons according to citycarbonfootprintsinfoone group of researchers at the university of new mexico has put a price on that pollution estimating in a paper that every dollar of bitcoin value mined accounts for  cents worth of health and climate damage in the uswith each cryptocurrency the rising electricity requirements to produce a single coin can lead to an almost inevitable cliff of negative net social benefit the paper statesother studies have found that the environmental damage caused by crypto mining is on par with mineral mining in an article published in nature climate change scientists warned that if it were to become as widely adopted as other new technologies bitcoin alone could push the earths temperature  degrees above historical levelsbitcoin is inefficient by design this inefficiency is the price we pay for security said anton dek crypto asset and blockchain lead at the cambridge centre for alternative finance and one of the researchers on the bitcoin energy trackerthe process of mining a bitcoin involves multitudes of computers competing to solve a complex math problem in which the first to reach a solution is rewarded with a bitcoin the complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for instance to hack the bitcoin blockchainit also means that how much bitcoin you can mine depends on how much computing power you can throw at the problem that has effectively set off an arms race in which miners invest in even more computing equipment that they keep running  hours a day and the more expensive bitcoin gets the more people want a shot at the actionracks of asic mining devices and power units at the bitcluster cryptocurrency mining farm in norilsk russia on december   norilsk hosts the arctics first crypto farm for producing new bitcoins andrey rudakovbloomberg via getty imagesif its more profitable it encourages more people to enter this competition — it encourages more miners to come dek saiddek is less concerned than others about bitcoins potential environmental impact pointing out that crypto mining uses as much electricity as americans waste by plugging in electrical appliances that are not running most miners use some renewable energy according to cambridge research although more than  of crypto mining is powered by fossil fuelswe are trying to make the point here that it is not that bad dek said we also dont want to say its not an issue at allas good as goldwe see the use case of bitcoin more and more as gold its something to preserve value not for everyday transactions dek saidthat sort of comparison however may be driving bitcoin into a speculative frenzy that could lock in high emissions for years to comebitcoins price surge has caused a run on bitcoin mining computers with bitmain a major maker of socalled mining rigs sold out through august while competitor canaan is working through a backlog of  orders these purchases arent refundable de vries noted which means that once miners receive their equipment they are likely to use them — even if a digital coins price has fallen in the meantimeall you care about once you get the machine is how much do i pay for electricity to run this machine the sunk cost doesnt matter anymore he saidso even if bitcoins price were to drop by half the planet is likely locked into high emissions from crypto mining for the near term — unless more miners can find cleaner sources of power to meet their computing demands or more regions follow chinas lead to restrict or eliminate bitcoin mining altogetheryou have all these miners using electricity — you can boot them off the grid if you want to thats an option you have as a regulator de vries saidunlike other economic activities the bitcoin scheme produces absolutely nothing for all this waste it is a pure speculative activity of people gambling on the random movements of prices and the only output is simply shuffling numbers around in a computer at insane cost  — stephen diehl smdiehl january  despite comparisons of bitcoin to gold many continue to question whether the virtual currency is worth anything commentators have compared it to a bubble noting that the currency cant be exchanged for most goods or servicesunlike other economic activities the bitcoin scheme produces absolutely nothing for all this waste said stephen diehl a software engineer who frequently writes about cryptocurrency it is a pure speculative activity of people gambling on the random movements of prices and the only output is simply shuffling numbers around in a computer at insane cost
