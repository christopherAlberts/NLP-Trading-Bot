kansas city chiefs tight end sean culkin who recently announced to the world he’s converting his  salary into bitcoin is now leading the nfl as the expert on cryptocurrencyi’ve been getting a lot of questions about crypto privately from guys in the league and we’re seeing more and more teams and players getting involved he told fox business it wasn’t that long ago that only a few of us knew what it was all about but players understand firsthand that fiat currency depreciates over time and they tend to grasp the concept of bitcoin as a store of value right awaythe millennial pro athlete who has a degree in finance and is working on an mba said he doesn’t feel payment in cryptocurrency is risky at allbitcoin is sound money — meaning it can transfer its value across time and space it is a monetary network that allows individuals to be their own bank and protect their savings from the inflationary environment the world operates in todayhe said that bitcoin today is comparable to gold in generations pastgold is valuable because individuals deem it so a big reason for that is due to its scarcity when considering its high stocktoflow ratio — a reflection of its current stock and how much issuance occurs each year as the price of gold rises miners are incentivized to increase production output resulting in supply exceeding demand and lowering its price it’s also very hard to verify the total supply of goldthe  tight end said finance in the future wont be grounded on actual reality but will live mostly in the digital realmbitcoin has similar properties except that its algorithm is very transparent about the current supply and how much is to be mined right now bitcoin’s stock is about  million with a maximum supply of  million to be mined over time as the price rises and miners are incentivized to produce more it becomes harder to do so over time due to the system’s halving process which occurs every four years each halving cycle means miners have to work twice as hard to produce the same amount of bitcoin bitcoin is inflationary resistant it also offers more utility and scalability than gold due to its technological properties — value can be transferred anywhere with bitcoin without the friction that comes with gold — transportation security time bitcoin is digital gold that is more conducive to future generations’ use of technologyculkin

classes most assets are offering negative real yields right now and if they are appreciating you have to ask yourself if the underlying asset is accreting or is the denominator just being debased bitcoin and other digital assets are outperforming the fed’s balance sheet i view it as a generational play because of its supply and demand fundamentals — the supply growth is algorithmically designed to be maxed out in the year  and as demand increases and supply remains constant price will appreciateculkin who is entering his fifth nfl season signed a reservefuture contract in february
