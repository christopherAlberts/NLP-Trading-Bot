after bitcoin crashed last week elon musk tweeted a diamond hands emoji to indicate that his company tesla is holding on to its bitcoin position photo via reutersis the meltdown in bitcoin warning us to get out of the stock market well according to morningstar the correlation between stocks and bitcoin is  or almost nonexistentbitcoin crashed again it got cut down by more than half the high it made on april   though let’s be honest about it by the time this column goes to print it could have restored its lossesi don’t own bitcoin or any cryptocurrencies for that matter i know lots of people who do including at my workplace i’m not against it i tell everyone who has the aptitude to do so “go ahead and trade it so long as you know the risks and have an exit plan trade it”i know — i’m an old man with archaic views call me crazy but i think that an unstable currency is useless in the long run and risky in the short run nonetheless to paraphrase one of my favorite corporate celebrities “i hope it goes to the moon” and it’s not just because i want my friends to get rich although i hope they do i want bitcoin to do well because i fear that it’s a potential harbinger of risk appetite for other places where i invest — like stocksis the meltdown in bitcoin warning us that we should get out of the stock market the “diamond hands” owners of bitcoin don’t ask that question “diamond hands” refers to bitcoin speculators who refuse to sell the currency no matter how much it drops in price they’ve been through this before heck on march   bitcoin prices plunged  percent in a single day that decline was part of a decline that cut its price by almost twothirds during a couple of months and there were undoubtedly other crashes — a dozen price reductions of  percent or moreeven with this most recent drop there hasn’t been a lot of selling at least as of may   digital currency manager coinshares reported that there were record outflows for that week outflows for bitcoin products totaled  million or a mere  percent of bitcoin assets for comparison in  speculators put  billion into bitcoin products much of that  million of outflows made their way to a competing cryptocurrency ethereumor more accurately said a lot of those outflows tried to make their way to ethereum apparently some of the bitcoin sellers accidentally confused ethereum with furnituremaker ethan allen and sent the company’s shares surging silly as that may be i reject the notion that the crash of bitcoin is the proverbial canary in the coal mine to use a cliché suitable to an oldtimer like myself instead of running from risk investors continue to chase risk i’m not saying that’s good i’m just saying that i don’t consider it a harbinger of things to come at least not at this timebesides according to morningstar the correlation between stocks as measured by the sp  and bitcoin is  or almost nonexistent they can simultaneously go up or down but doing so appears to be more coincidental than causal it makes a lot of sense to me that the two should be connected but the math says that i am wrongi am concerned about a lot of things that have to do with the stock market but a bitcoin meltdown isn’t too high on that listhousing bubbleshould you buy a house there are a lot of factors that go into answering such a personal question today i’ll just focus on the most macroeconomic of those factors — is housing in a bubble a quick answer no it isn’t but i wouldn’t blame you if you wondered if it isus house prices were up  percent in  according to the national association of realtors listed homes are on the market for a median of only  days and  percent of homes are sold in less than one monththe housing bubble in the late  was primarily sparked due to poor lending standards people who could not afford to buy a house were allowed to do so unlike the  people can afford to buy their homes today cash sales account for about onefourth of sales and banks typically won’t lend to a firsttime homebuyer for more than  to  percent of its value in  nearly threequarters of homebuyers using conventional loans had fico scores above  and  percent had scores above  according to an origination insight reportmortgage rates will rise in the short term and price some new buyers out of the market but those rates are low enough and demand is high enough to support costs housing prices will slow probably to about  percent in  and then something closer to the rate of inflation while localized bubbles are possible the us housing market is not in a bubbleallen
