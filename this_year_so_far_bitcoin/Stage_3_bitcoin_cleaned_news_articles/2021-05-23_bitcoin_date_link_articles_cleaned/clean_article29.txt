one of the greatest attractions of bitcoin is its limited issuance – there will only ever be  million coins though the current supply is  millionhowever the number of bitcoin available for buying and selling is much lower than this crypto research group glassnode estimates three million bitcoin or  could be lost forever for a variety of reasons early miners lost their hard drives or bitcoin owners passed away taking their private keys with them to the gravethen there are the  million bitcoin btc mined by its mysterious founder satoshi nakamoto which remain untouched to this day that shaves another  off the available supplyof far greater importance is the rise of the institutional ‘hodler’ those ‘holding on for dear life’ who see bitcoin as a store of value at a time of financial uncertainty“quantifying bitcoin’s liquidity is essential to understand its market if many bitcoins are illiquid a supplyside crisis emerges – which has a weakening effect on btc’s selling pressure in the market“or put differently a sustained rise of illiquid bitcoins is an indication of strong investor holding sentiment and a potentially bullish signal” says glassnodethis is reflected in the graph below with blue representing the proportion of bitcoin that is deemed ‘illiquid’ which amounts to  million of the total issued supply only three million btc are deemed ‘highly liquid’ and available for buying and selling with a further  million deemed ‘liquid’this means that around  of the circulating bitcoin supply is considered illiquidglassnode says the illiquidity trend has been in place for well over a year“this indicates that the present bull market is driven by the staggering amount of illiquidity currently we are at a stage in which the illiquid supply is growing more than the total circulating supply  a pattern we have similarly observed during the bull run of ”one of the key factors contributing to the supply shortage is the rapid accumulation of bitcoin by institutions for treasury purposes says revix ceo sean sanders“what started out with one or two adventurous corporations deciding to invest a substantial part of their treasury assets in bitcoin as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation has now grown into dozens of companies – and all in the space of less than a year“this has been a gamechanger for bitcoin because companies like business intelligence group microstrategy have become massive buyers of bitcoin tesla is another company that recently announced it had invested a substantial portion of its available cash into bitcoin following in the footsteps of microstrategy’s ceo michael saylor and twitter founder jack dorsey’s company square”rise of etfs another contributing factoryet another reason for the evaporating supply is the rise of exchangetraded funds etfs such as grayscale bitcoin trust offering investors an indirect route to bitcoin via a listed vehiclegrayscale currently owns   bitcoin or just over  of the total available supplymany investment firms are prohibited from investing directly in bitcoin but can invest directly in a listed vehicle that offers exposure to bitcoin while taking care of custody issues listing and regulatory requirementsa number of europeanbased exchangetraded products etps now offer easy and regulated access to bitcoin“bitcoin’s supply shortage is important for a number of reasons” says sanders “bitcoin has grown at a compound average annual rate of  a year for the last decade and while this growth has been volatile overall bitcoin has demonstrated its versatility as a store of value and a hedge against inflation ironically institutional adoption is likely to increase as the price goes up so we see the supply shortage underpinning the price going forward“what this also means is that we might expect to see reduced volatility in bitcoin in the years ahead” he adds“what this evaporating supply tells us about the macroeconomic environment is that bitcoin is now starting to be perceived as a safe reliable store of value or as it is often called gold “with trillions of us dollars being added to the existing money supply just in the last year inflation is a guarantee bitcoin has solved that problem with its hard cap of  million coins in issue”brought to you by revixabout revixrevix brings simplicity trust and great customer service to investing their easy to use online
