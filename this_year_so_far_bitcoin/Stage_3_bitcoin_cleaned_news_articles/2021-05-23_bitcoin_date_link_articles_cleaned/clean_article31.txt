bitcoin ethereum and other cryptocurrencies have obviously had a horrible week and while it’s foolish to try predicting where things go next there are two big similarities between this move and the one we saw at the end of  the last time bitcoin made its peakthe first is that just like last time the bitcoin peak came almost exactly at the point of a major milestone in institutional acceptancebitcoin peaked this year on april  at a price just under  that also happened to be the exact same day of the coinbase ipo which was a major milestone for the industryit just so happens that in  bitcoin peaked on dec  of that year that was basically the exact moment that the cme launched bitcoin futures which again at the time was a major institutional milestone so that’s similarity number onethe other big pattern is the way that bitcoin peaks first followed by other blowoff tops in altcoinsgoing back to the last cycle bitcoin peaked in december of  but other coins peaked in januaryfor example you can see that xrp sometimes known as ripple actually peaked several days after bitcoin had already started going downagain it’s a similar story this time around while bitcoin peaked over a month ago other coins peaked several days later compare bitcoin vs ethereum over the last yearobviously you have to be careful being too aggressive in drawing historical comparisons but crypto cycles seem to have some patterns to them whereby they start with people entering bitcoin then migrating to alts and then going hard into alts into the end while the bitcoin trade starts to lose its juicefurthermore there’s also acceptance cycles people in traditional finance gravitate towards the crypto siren song and so it’s not too surprising to see big institutional milestones futures launches ipos etc around peaksthis story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the textsubscribe to mint newsletters  enter a valid email  thank you for subscribing to our newsletter
