bitcoin has a long way to go in this bull market and the rest of the year looks brightdespite bitcoin’s meteoric rise of over  this year onchain analysis paints a picture of it still being early in the game why three words coin days destroyed cddnowhere near the top this yearby assessing cdd we can visualize the confidence among longterm bitcoin holders relative to the current price of bitcointo understand how cdd works let’s start with coin dayswhat is a coin daycoin days are the number of days since a bitcoin was moved over from one wallet to another the logic behind them is to assign a higher value to an idle coin why because longterm bitcoin holders have greater knowledge of market cycle volatility and thus are more adept at identifying the best times to buy or sellso when longterm holders sell their bitcoin the coin days destroyed will surge higher when strong hands hold cdd trends lower which suggests their confidence in a new bull marketwhat are coin days destroyedcoin days destroyed is a term for when bitcoin that’s been sitting in a wallet—accruing coin days—is all of a sudden sold causing those coin days to be “destroyed” importantly bitcoin is not actually destroyed cdd is simply terminology that calculates the time erasedhere’s an example imagine an investor purchases  bitcoin and holds it in their wallet for  days then sees a big increase in the price and decides to sell he would have “destroyed”  bitcoin dayswhen investors are accumulating and few old coins are spent coin days destroyed will trend downwards during latestage bull markets old coins often are increasingly spent and will lead to a spike in coin days destroyedthe beauty of this formula it weighs less on the activity of shortterm traders since these traders don’t hold bitcoin for long their impact on coin days destroyed will be minimal as compared to the activities of longterm tradershowever when longterm holders are starting to sell their bitcoin it’s worth paying attention towhen we look at these important metrics it appears that bitcoin is nowhere near its high this year bitcoin is now over  but the  moving average for coin days destroyed is near its lowest levels see the chart belowchart compiled by portfolio insider onchain data from coin metricsthe decline in coin days destroyed shows that old hands are stronger than ever amid the price increasehow is cdd calculatedcoin days destroyed is calculated bythe number of bitcoin in a transaction multiplied by the number of days since those coins were last spentthe “destroyed” part comes into effect when it is removed on receipt once again it means the coins held for long periods of time will carry more weight in cddthis onchain metric shows the weight of the strong hands versus the shortterm speculatorsthe current number of coin days destroyed is far lower than the  price top so this indicates that fewer veteran hands are selling than in the previous bull cycleschart compiled by portfolio insider onchain data from coin metricsconsidering the bitcoin network is now  years old and the current btc supply has already appreciated it’s telling that strong hands are not selling their holdings this suggests that the market top is nowhere near our current pricewhat’s more the higher demand from institutional investors could be the primary force behind this recent surge in longterm confidence from veteran holdersin april fidelity investments with  trillion in assets under management introduced an analytics platform capable of onchain bitcoin data visualization for its institutional clients called “sherlock” wells fargo is also preparing to embrace bitcoin investing as it announces it will offer an actively managed cryptocurrency productthese moves by highprofile asset management firms underscore the rise of institutional investors who are banking on the future growth in bitcointhis is a guest post by portfolio insider opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of btc inc or bitcoin magazine
