followed a meeting hosted by vice premier liu he and is one of the most highprofile warnings against cryptocurrencies in recent yearsearlier in the week chinese authorities cracked down on the crypto industry as a whole banning financial institutions from offering any form of crypto service bitcoin mining was not mentioned but this news shows it is still on the governments radarwhat is bitcoin miningbitcoin mining is the way new coins are created and recent transactions are verified mining is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the system but it also consumes a lot of energybitcoin is like a very sophisticated database made up of a chain of individual blocks in order to create a new block miners must solve a complex puzzle and verify the transactions in the blockchain the computer that solves the puzzle first wins and gains the transaction fees and a quantity of bitcoinbut by design only one block can be mined every  minutes so that the rate stays steady the more computer power thats being expended to solve the puzzle the harder the puzzle becomes thats why you see images of huge banks of computers all attempting to be the first to solve the puzzle this builtin inefficiency is incredibly bad for the environment according to research by the university of cambridge the most popular digital currency in the world uses about the same amount of energy as netherlands or united arab emiratesbitcoin mining in chinathe cambridge researchers found that about  of bitcoin mining takes place in china the united states and russia are second and third on the list respectively with about  eachchina aims to be carbon neutral by  and reach its peak  emissions before  thats why it announced guidelines in  to curb the activity of bitcoin miners this weeks statements are a continuation of existing policy decisionswithin china the inner mongolia region represents about  of the countrys mining efforts in late february local authorities gave bitcoin miners two months to shut down their operations citing heavy pollution and environmental concerns a few days ago the inner mongolia development and reform commission announced a hotline for people to report illegal bitcoin mining farmsaccording to the financial times inner mongolia faces extra pressure from beijing to cut emissions because its authorized more coalfired plants than any other province in the last five yearsthis weeks announcements are not new china has made several moves in recent years to restrict cryptocurrency investments including banning cryptocurrency exchanges however they reflect an even stricter stance some observers believe this is because china plans to launch its own centralized digital yuan which is currently in a pilot phasewhat does it mean for investorsbitcoin has tumbled about  in the past  hours at the time of this writing and the global crypto market lost  of its value according to data from coinmarketcapin terms of mining its worth remembering that  unlike coal or gold  halving the number of miners would not half the production of bitcoin if a large proportion of bitcoin miners shut down the puzzle would become easier to solve and wed still get a new block every  minutesbut thats unlikely a more likely scenario some mining will continue in china but some operations will move to other countries the us may benefit along with countries like iceland georgia canada and estoniachinas move could also prompt increased regulation worldwide its widely expected that the us will announce additional crypto regulation at some point this year and india and turkey have tightened up on crypto in recent weeksthis week has been a harsh reminder that cryptocurrency prices can swing wildly up and down thats why its important to only invest money you can afford to lose and to invest for the long term investing for the long term means researching assets you believe will perform well in the next five to  years or more and holding them through the dips that way
