photo of paul krugman credit ed ritger the commonwealth clubthe hysteria surrounding bitcoin and the crypto market at large is at an alltime high you know something must be up when your uncle with a gambling problem posts on social media phrases like “bull market” “hodl” and “when lambo”although bitcoin erased all gains made in  over the course of  hours last week momentarily trading below  it now trades at  more than  down from  in april the crypto market’s extreme volatility hasn’t scared young investors — on the contrary it’s made them more drawn to it than ever as of april  more than  million american adults or about  of the us population own cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ethereumaccording to a report released by gemini crypto exchange the number of people invested in crypto is set to double this year as people fear missing out on what they believe is the opportunity of a lifetime after all in just a couple of months in late  bitcoin surged almost  becoming a crypto billionaire in the new mantra for advertisementbut the vast majority of these new retail investors are not aware of the risks they’re facing a recent survey found that only  of investors who have bought crypto “fully understand” the value and potential of cryptocurrency while  of buyers have either zero knowledge about the space or would call their level of understanding “emerging”aside from fomo fears of missing out extra cash to spare from all those stimulus checks and the daily rush of trading new investors are drawn to a sense of community but paul krugman a nobel prizewinning economist believes this socalled community is nothing but a “cult that can’t survive indefinitely”i dont write much about bitcoin because there arent any fundamentals to discuss   — paul krugman paulkrugman may  krugman who won the nobel prize in economics for his work on global trade theory in  had publicly criticized bitcoin as well the other  ‘alt coins’ out there at the moment in a  column for the ny times krugman said that compared to fiat currency ‘normal’ currency backed by the government such as usd or euro crypto tokens cost more to transact in and have no value “backstop” or reinforcement like traditional governmentbacked currenciesadvertisement“their value depends entirely on selffulfilling expectations — which means that total collapse is a real possibility if speculators were to have a collective moment of doubt suddenly fearing that bitcoins were worthless well bitcoins would become worthless” krugman wrote in btc isnt a new innovation its been around since  and in all that time nobody seems to have found any good legal use for it its not a convenient medium of exchange its not a stable store of value its definitely not a unit of account  — paul krugman paulkrugman may  its value rests on the perception that its a technologically sophisticated way to protect yourself from the inevitable collapse of fiat money which is coming one of these days or maybe one of these centuries or as i say libertarian derp plus technobabble  — paul krugman paulkrugman may  but ive given up predicting imminent demise there always seem to be a new crop of believers maybe just think of it as a cult that can survive indefinitely  — paul krugman paulkrugman may  it’s not hard to see where krugman is coming from there is a strong sense of belonging among crypto enthusiasts who tend to only share positive news and support each other when the market is down there’s this strong sensation in the crypto communities that there is only one way to go from here — and that’s up in fact one of the most common replies to crypto content on social media which is almost always positive and ‘gamechanging’ is “to the moon”in a blog post louis petrik wrote that there are “almost no skeptics” in the countless subreddits dedicated to cryptos and crypto trading “the fact that there are almost no skeptics has a reason censorship” he wrotemost of today’s crypto devotees seem to be made from a different cloth than traditional investors in stocks bonds and other assets they protest against wall street capitalism seem to enjoy the disruptive market and seem to see trading bitcoin and other crypto assets as their best chance at beating the rat racethis behavior say economists george akerlof and rachel kranton can be explained by “identity economics” — a branch of economics that describes behaviors at odds with traditional models of rationality identity economics can explain why some people choose to stay in a job that pays less than they could make elsewhere why people vote against their economic interests or more recently why crypto traders stake their capital on the riskiest possible bets with scant regard for corresponding returnsget more

leave this field empty if youre humanwhether or not these traders will come out alive when the crypto growth cycle inevitably heads south in correction territory bear market what seems certain now is that the “crypto cult” is a force to be reckoned with there are hundreds of billions traded in crypto markets on a daily basis on top of that these investors are more irrational injecting further volatility into an everfluctuating marketwill the crypto cult collapse at the first turn for the worse or will it “hodl” as its members proudly claim time will tell — but for now there are quite a few
