an experts point of view on a current eventchia is a new way to waste resources for cryptocurrencybitcoin the first cryptocurrency has a problem it uses ghastly quantities of electricity and thus generates as much carbon emissions as a mediumsized country this is by design a new cryptocurrency chia avoids this problem—in favor of creating huge amounts of a different kind of wastebitcoin was meant to be decentralized so as to stay out of any central control the “proofofwork mining” process allocates fresh coins by a lottery you enter this lottery by guessing numbers and running calculations on them as fast as possible—that is you waste electricity to show your commitment there is one winner every  minutes as more people join the lottery the guessing gets harder to stay at one winner every  minutesas long as people can make money wasting electricity they’ll add more computing resources to win more bitcoins in an everescalating arms race bitcoin thus uses as much electricity as the netherlandsproof of work has economies of scale the bigger you are the more efficiently you can create lottery tickets despite the grandiose claims of putting financial power in the public’s hands bitcoin mining functionally centralized by  the majority of bitcoin mining is three large pools an electricity outage in one small area of xinjiang in april  took a quarter of all bitcoin mining offline bitcoin mining also uses specialized computers that just calculate cryptographic hashes as fast as possible once the mining computers are obsolete they’re just ewasteother cryptocurrencies are similarly wasteful ethereum uses as much electricity as peru there are smaller cryptocurrencies that don’t use this process but bitcoin and ethereum are the two cryptos that are widely exchangeable for actual money cryptos failed as usable currencies so their only remaining use case is to be traded in the hope of actual moneybram cohen is famed as the creator of the hugely popular bittorrent file distribution protocol cohen turned his attention to the proofofwork problem he explicitly wanted a “green bitcoin” so chia founded by cohen works very much like bitcoin apart from proof of work chia’s business white paper advocates the same conspiracy theory economics that was embraced by the bitcoin subculture it assumes that governments fundamentally cannot be trusted to issue money and wasting a country’s worth of electricity is a better alternativethe resource cohen chose to use for his socalled green cryptocurrency chia was computer hard disk space this is a generic reusable form of computer hardware it’s widely available and he thought this would use less electricity than proof of work cohen anticipated that casual chia users could use “the unused storage of your laptop desktop or corporate network”to “farm” chia the software writes a “plot” a large chunk of cryptographic data to the disk the chia blockchain software broadcasts a “challenge” every  seconds or so  times a day if you have a close enough answer to the challenge you win two fresh chia tokens as more disk space is added to the network the challenges get hardercohen’s company chia network secured venture capital funding in  and developed the chia software the network was launched in march  with the promise users could run it in a “normal apartment” chia’s business white paper assumes that hard disk space is “overprovisioned” however aspiring chia farmers bought hard disks in vast quantities thousands of terabytes at a time—as they only had to spend less money than they expected to make backduring the  pandemic manufacturing supply chains were already disrupted in multiple industries leading to shortages of many basic components by april just a month after it was launched chia farmers were straining the hard disk market with reports from hong kong of large disks over  terabytes having tripled in price hard disk shortages and price rises were reported across southeast asia and in the united stateschia’s initial plotting process is usually done on a solidstate drive ssd such as you’d find in a desktop or laptop in normal usage a modern ssd will last over a decade an ssd that’s plotting chia may burn out in less than six weeks ssd manufacturers are now refusing to honor warranties on ssds used for crypto mining secondhand ssds and hard disks manufactured since  can no longer be trusted not to be burntout wrecks in germany the popular cloud service hetzner has banned chia farminginstead of carbon dioxide chia produces vast quantities of ewaste—rare metals assembled into expensive computing components turned into toxic nearunrecyclable landfill within weeks cohen has tweeted that the claim that chia destroys disks is mostly “just plain wrong”—though he ends the tweet thread by effectively admitting that it’s true but blames users for using “consumer ssd” even though chia’s own faq states that it can be run on mobile phones or laptopschia plotting is heavy on electricity too—plotting requires arbitrary calculations by a computing device’s central processing unit cpu an intensive task chia’s business white paper anticipates farming on “one raspberry pi” a small computer about as powerful as a  iphone—but in practice chia plotting requires multiple cpu threads running continuously at close to  percentchia failed at decentralization for the same reason that bitcoin did centralization is more efficient the largest chia pool hpool is winning  percent of chia farming rewards and increasing smaller chia farmers have complained that hpool was given a head start by chia network the first  million chia coins were created ahead of time and are held by chia network in anticipation of being distributed in the event that chia network holds an initial public offeringchia ran headlong into the known psychology of cryptocurrency mining people will do anything that will generate a net profit—and damn the externalitiescryptocurrency mining has also trashed the market for computer video cards bitcoin mining uses specialized chips that can only mine bitcoin but ethereum and many other “altcoins” that use proof of work are still mined on video cards as they’re well suited to complex numerical computation with the price of bitcoin in an economic asset bubble the other coins have gone up as well so highend nvidia video cards are all but unavailable with prices going through the roof and the cards being snapped up as quickly as possible the latest nvidia cards have resorted to drivers—the software that runs the hardware—that detect and block cryptocurrency mining and just as with hard disks secondhand video cards can’t be trusted not to be burntout wrecksalmost any service that can do general computation is immediately swarmed by parasitical crypto miners continuous integration ci systems take computer program source code and build it afresh after every change to allow quick testing of all changes some public ci services used to offer a free tier for small projects—but crypto miners started spamming these services with cpubased crypto mining one ci service engineer said “if we for example had a team of  working on our ci offering we would have reallocated at least  of them to work fulltime on combating the miners and this trend is not slowing it is only accelerating”cryptocurrency decentralization is a performative waste of resources in order to avoid having to trust a government to issue currency but since cryptocurrencies don’t actually function as currencies it just generates new types of otherwise worthless magic beans to sell for real money your system will waste unlimited amounts of whatever resource you’re throwing away—and incentivize the theft of whatever resources other people can waste to turn into moneycryptocurrency spews out a country’s worth of carbon dioxide and mountains of toxic ewaste makes basic computing hardware that could be used for productive purposes unavailable and destroys any sort of commons that someone might want to offer the world if general computation could be done on it decentralized cryptocurrencies are a cyberpunk parody of unregulated capitalism they are a disastrous resource drain on the world by design the designers look only for fresh resources to abuse the only functional purpose of decentralized cryptocurrencies is to further idiosyncratic bitcoin economic ideas that don’t work in the hope of making money from speculation every cryptocurrency is a new form of waste—and the only way to stop that is to stop cryptocurrencies
