how do cryptocurrency markets react to cyberattacks — theft of digital coins a new paper shows a surprising delay in their response to such events measured by the market’s volatilityit’s estimated that around  million bitcoins were stolen between  and  — a figure that has only gone up since at today’s prices this is equivalent to losses of more than  billion which is quite a lot of money and the problem seems to grow up in scale as bitcoin continues to surge you’d expect markets to clamp up immediately after each such event but according to dr klaus grobys at the university of vaasa finland this isn’t the casemarkets do respond to such events as measured through their levels of uncertainty but much slower than expectedadvertisementbitpricesdr grobys analyzed  hacking incidents in the bitcoin market that occurred over that timeframe finding that it doesn’t respond volatilitywise for roughly  days after a cyberattack bitcoin volatility did rise substantially on the fifth day after such an event however this pattern remained valid even after controlling for the volatility seen immediately after an attack he explainsthis delay in feedback dr grobys explains points to inefficiencies in the market the fact that shocks need time to be fully integrated or priced into the market is a strong indicator of such inefficienciesget more science news like this join the zme newsletter for amazing science news features and exclusive scoops more than  subscribers cant be wrong daily weekly i have read and agree to the terms  conditions leave this field empty if youre humananother interesting finding of the paper is that hackings in the bitcoin market also influenced the value of other cryptocurrencies dr grobys says there is a ‘contagion effect‘ in cryptocurrency volatility associated with hacking events for example volatility in the ethereum market increased dramatically with the same  time delay after a hacking event in the bitcoin marketadvertisementone possible explanation for this is that people are using one cryptocurrency to cash out on the other stolen one this in effect shifts demand from the cryptocurrency that was hacked to the other“my study is a first attempt to reveal potential risk factors and their effects on the new emerging digital financial markets—cyberattacks is only one of these new risk factors from my point of view much more research needs to be done on this issue” says dr klaus grobysbitcoin is the largest player on the cryptocurrency market currently and dr grobys explains that it’s not yet clear whether a lessknown one would show the same ‘contagion effect’ — future research will have to explore thisanother observation he makes is that “bitcoin is traded on multiple exchanges but the attacks are always limited to one exchange” in the future he plans to see how bitcoin volatility behaves at the exchange where the attack took place not the whole market after a theftthe paper “when the blockchain does not block on hackings and uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market” has been published in the journal quantitative finance
