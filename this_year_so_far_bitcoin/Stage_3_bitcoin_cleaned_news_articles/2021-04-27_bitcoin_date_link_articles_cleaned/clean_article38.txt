“money is a matter of functions four a medium a measure a standard and a store”this chant cited by alfred milnes in  book titled “the economic foundations of reconstruction” summarises the four basic properties of moneyit’s one of the basics you learn studying economics which is going to help us understand why decentralised digital currencies are unlikely to perform the same functionsfor currency to serve its purpose it has to be a medium of exchange measure of value standard of deferred payment store of valuein other words it has to be commonly accepted for transactional purposes so you don’t have to pay for a good with another good or service it has to accurately reflect the value of products and services it allows for settling payments at deferred dates ie debt and it can also be used to store value from whatever you sell ie savedto serve well in at least three out of four of these functions a currency has to possess a stable predictable valuethe volatility of bitcoinit’s hard to accurately measure how much anything is worth using a medium whose own price fluctuates highly all the timea  car would have cost  btc in october but less than two btc today — and there’s no telling which way it’s going to go in the next few monthsbitcoin’s price history from  to   image credit coingeckoas you can see above within the last five years the price of bitcoin went from  to  then down to  up to  down to  and recently to over  in just a few days its value can fluctuate by  or  per centwith changes this fast and frequent it creates chaos as yesterday’s prices may be irrelevant today in a lot of ways it’s like living in a country with hyperinflation — only that the price is rapidly changing in both directions for the same reason it’s hard to use digital currencies to settle deferred transactions most payments in business are executed on predetermined dates or within a defined future time framecontracts for delivery of products or services can be settled within a window of a week month or even a quarter of course as long as a currency’s value is predictable it isn’t a big deal as it’s unlikely that it is going to change dramatically days is a fairly standard timeframe for issuing payments however with cryptocurrencies being able to jump a few hundred per cent over a period of weeks you can’t predict what the deferred payment you agreed to may actually be worth when the date is due it would make conducting any business highly riskyfinally the worst indictment against digital currencies is their demonstrable inability to store value in a safe predictable way — for the very same reasons outlined aboveif you saved your  btc in october then you’re obviously super happy now – your  in savings has transformed into  but if you save  btc today and the price tanks to past levels within the next few months you will be a few hundred grand out of pocketyou can’t stabilise the value of bitcoinsbitcoin — like other cryptocurrencies — does anything but store value it can be treated as an investment or more accurately as a speculative gamble as there really isn’t much that the currency is backed with other than prevailing demandtraditional currencies are currently supported by entire economies that the rest of the world is either engaging or not in trade with this is additionally stabilised by central banks amassing foreign reserves and using their power to print additional currency as needed to ensure the national currency remains stable and fulfils the four criteriazimbabwe currency  image credit wikipediawhenever local authorities are unable to maintain this stability disasters follow typically with local money losing value to the point of becoming completely worthless like in venezuela or zimbabwethat’s why in some of the poorest and weakest countries the preferred currency accepted more readily than local notes is often the us dollarsince cryptocurrencies do not have any mechanisms that would stabilise their value in response to fluctuations nor are they representing any particular market or country that the people would be willing to trade with they lack the anchors that would keep their value in placenational currencies provide access you need them to buy goods and services in a given country whether you’re a local buying a burger a tourist visiting disneyland or a foreign government procuring fighter jets you need to pay in us dollars to complete the order in americait works the same in every other place if you want to visit europe you need some euros if you’re going to china prepare to buy some yuan yen in japan ringgit in malaysia birr in ethiopia and so onhowever decentralised cryptocurrencies are not really necessary for anythingyou can buy the same goods and services with dollars pounds euros in fact the only things that bitcoin and other can open the doors for you is the illicit stuff which you wouldn’t want to be seen or in any way tracked buying like drugsall that glitters is not goldthe volume of bitcoin is capped by design at  million and the units are progressively more difficult to mine with timeoutside of the digital world achieving price stability is done by adjusting the money supply to reflect the country’s economic growth what is the role of central banks but it’s impossible to do with cryptocurrencies due to their builtin limitations and lack of outside controlthere is about  trillion worth of currencies in circulation in the world right now in a simple example it would mean that for btc to replace them today each coin would have to be priced at around and since the world is growing — both economically and in terms of population — the scarcity of btc would keep its price going up this contributes to price deflation of all products and services which only exacerbates economic crises since it makes people hold onto currency in anticipation of its higher future value thus reducing economic activity leading to prolonged recessionsthe gold standard  image credit metalscomit’s a bit like the gold standard when money supply was linked to the ability of a country to back its currency with the precious metal if the government didn’t have enough of it it was stuck as it couldn’t expand its money supply in response to economic growthcountries which got off the gold standard and were able to adjust their monetary policies more freely emerged from the great depression of  faster than those which did not ultimately the entire system was unsustainable and collapsed with freefloating fiat currencies taking its place in the at the very least however the gold standard had the benefit of being based on a scarce metal that held intrinsic practical valueyou can take gold or silver anywhere in the world and exchange it for money as there’s always demand for it but cryptocurrencies are based on nothing if their value collapses to zero the only thing you’re going to hold is a digital record you wouldn’t even be able to use as toilet paperthere are alternatives of course like ethereum which do not have a total maximum cap — at least theoretically but in every case the supply of the currency is controlled by predetermined mathematical calculations which do not respond to changing economic realitiesmany people distrust the governments and central bankers but they’re still a safer bet than a computer algorithm that steadily ploughs onward regardless of the circumstances keeping control in human hands means that the policies can be adjusted rapidly in response to economic challengesironically for all the useful applications of the blockchain technology using it for digital currencies is probably the least practical oneso much so that even tesla — which recently broadly paraded its embrace of bitcoin by allowing customers to pay for their cars using the digital currency — states in its disclosures that in case of a return the company is going to decide how to return the payment whether in btc or usd and you bear all the risk this means that they are going to return you whatever costs them lesstesla disclosure  image credit teslain other words the company doesn’t really treat bitcoin as a currency — more as a mode of payment — and is only interested in handling it in conditions favourable to its businessit’s quite possible that elon musk wanted to both ride and stimulate the wave lifting cryptocurrencies so the company itself or he personally can make a large amount of money in the processbitcoin shouldn’t be regarded as a currencythe market is exciting thanks to its high volatility as it allows speculators to make significant profits very quickly but it also comes with a risk of heavy lossesmany tears have been shed by the owners of digital tokens depending on whether they bought in too late or sold too earlyand for these reasons we shouldn’t be talking about bitcoin et al as currencies because they simply do not fulfil the basic criteria to be onethe sheer idea of digitalisation of money is excellent and perfectly rational in this day and agevarious applications of blockchain open up many possibilities outside of finance but for it to enter widespread use it has to be implemented in a controlled regulated way that can be trusted by millions of ordinary people who don’t want to spend their lives tracking daily exchange rates of some imaginary digital coinsfor any currency to retain a stable value it has to be managed by state authorities setting realistic expectations and using tools of monetary policy to achieve themit is simply not possible in the opensource world of antiestablishment nerds i’m sure independent digital currencies aren’t going away — they’re here to stay for both use and speculation but the real revolution is going to happen when the governments begin to issue their ownfeatured image credit npr  kenny malone and alice wilder
