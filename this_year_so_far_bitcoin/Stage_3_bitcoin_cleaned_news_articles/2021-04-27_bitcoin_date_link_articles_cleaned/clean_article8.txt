bitcoin’s recent price crash which saw it lose a quarter of its value after hitting an alltime high could be just the “midway dip” in a new recordbreaking rally if market patterns from  and  are repeatedthis is the view of a number of prominent cryptocurrency analysts who adhere to a “stocktoflow” model dictated by bitcoin’s inbuilt scarcitythe model is based on the relationship between the existing stockpiles of bitcoin and the yearly production rate of new bitcoins through digital mining roughly every four years a “halving” event occurs that reduces the rewards for mining the cryptocurrency by  per cent after the first halving in  bitcoin’s price rose from around  to  before falling back down the second halving in  saw bitcoin’s price rise from  to  before dipping againthe most recent halving event took place in may  right at the beginning of the latest price rally it has since risen from below  to the new alltime high of  that it hit this month after briefly falling below  it has since recovered slightly to  at the time of writingthis latest dip appears to be similar in scale and timing to other dips experienced following the  and  halvingstwitter planbthe creator of this stocktoflow model is the netherlandsbased analyst ‘planb’ whose most recent projections suggest that bitcoin is still only trading at a fraction of its next major peaka graph plotting bitcoin’s value over time on a logarithmic scale where its value increases by increments of  shows that the cryptocurrency has largely followed a linear progression since its inception in in his original stocktoflow model from march  planb noted that irregularities could be attributed to various external forces – as evidenced by the pandemicinduced market crash in early  – but that ultimately bitcoin’s fixed supply is the main driver of price movements in the long term“other factors also impact price – regulation hacks and other news – that is why it is not  per cent and not all dots are on the line” he wrote “however the dominant driving factor seems to be scarcity”planbdr saifedean ammous economist and author of the bitcoin standard also noticed similarities between the recent price crash and the previous posthalving rallies“more than two years after this model was published the price continues to track the model’s predictions with astonishing precision” he tweeted in response to the latest dipanother analyst noted “this is starting to play out scary close”following bitcoin’s price crash in march  which saw it briefly dip below  planb stood by the model and its forecast that the cryptocurrency will hit  at some point in a month after the  crash he went even further by releasing a revised version of this stocktoflow model that put bitcoin’s trajectory on course for planba market report by cryptocurrency exchange luno soon after cited the stocktoflow model stating “based on bitcoin’s historical data it may be a lucrative level to accumulate more bitcoin now”at the time one bitcoin was worth just konstantin anissimov executive director at londonbased cryptocurrency exchange cexio in another figure within the cryptocurrency industry to praise the accuracy of the model and its apparent ability to predict future prices“the stocktoflow model has been extremely accurate at anticipating bitcoin’s future price action as a direct result of the supply shock it experiences following each halving” he told the independent“based on this fundamental indicator bitcoin’s scarcity is highly correlated with the value of the network as the cryptocurrency’s rate of production dropped to  new tokens per annum last august such a significant cut had a serious implication on prices”the final halving event is expected to occur at some point in  at which point all  million bitcoins will have been mined into existenceestimates for what bitcoin will be worth by then range from  to  trillion in terms of its overall market cap – putting it on par with the global real estate marketwhatever bitcoin’s eventual peak ends up being there is another pattern that has appeared without fail during every halving cycle so far each recordbreaking high has been followed by a recordbreaking crash
