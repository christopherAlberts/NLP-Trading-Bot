dont panic the fact that you can now mine bitcoin using a commodore  doesnt mean theres going to be a world shortage of   because it somehow turns out not to be profitable in fact it would actually cost you some  quadrillion in energy alone though as our jacob has pointed out solar power will be pretty cheap by thenwe are due to be swallowed up by the sun in around seven to eight billion years which means it will be nothing if not plentifulthe youtube channel  show and tell via sweclockers has shown the bitcoin miner  software running on a standard commodore  and ill be honest my eyeballs got a little moist at the sight of the beautiful old grey slab of personal computing joyeven if it could only achieve a bitcoin hash at a rate of every  seconds or around  hsgiven that current bitcoin asics are being measured in terahashes per second and not just straight hashes per second you can see why its going to take a while with the venerable  the  trillion year mark is also a ballpark figure for the upgraded supercpu accelerator addon that  show and tell used in their video to try and bump up the commodore rigs performance i dont want to get near the extreme numbers youd run into at  hsyour next machine image credit future best gaming pc the top prebuilt machines from the prosbest gaming laptop perfect notebooks for mobile gamingwith the accelerator in place we can see the hash rate leaps to a heady  hs that would net you  bitcoin per year and at  hs on the   that would still cost you around  per year to mine and realistically the hashing difficulty might just creep up over the next  trillion years we might run out of bitcoins by then toothey note that the software theyre using is written in c but they could potentially achieve a speedup of up to ten times if it was written in machine code though that still wouldnt make any difference to your chance of turning a profitnot sure how it would stack up against ethereum so were still no closer to figuring out if it can take some of the strain off the beleaguered graphics card market but weve got to hope that new ethereum bitmain asic will shoulder some of that burden for usstill at least the upgraded commodore  is quicker than a game boy at bitcoin mining as a longtime commodore fanboi im holding onto that as a win
