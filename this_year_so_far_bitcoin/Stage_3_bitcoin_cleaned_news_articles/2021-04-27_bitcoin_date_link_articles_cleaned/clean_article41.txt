silvergate capital nysesi is a small bank in california thats been around for over  years back in  the bank noticed the rise of interest in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cryptobtc the bank wanted to land all the new trading exchanges like coinbase nasdaqcoin as customers and provide banking services to them and all the institutions that wanted to trade this new digital currencyso silvergate created the silvergate exchange network or sen to enable these clients to trade bitcoin and other forms of crypto  the way it works institutions that want to trade crypto open an account at the bank then when they trade cryptocurrency on coinbase or one of the other trading platforms that are aligned with silvergate that platform handles the crypto exchange while silvergate transfers the dollars into its customer accountsthis has been an immensely profitable venture for silvergate and it is just getting started all of these funds are in trading accounts at the bank and silvergate doesnt pay any interest on the deposits so this is a windfall for the bankconsider for a moment if inflation takes off and interest rates begin to rise high interest rates are very beneficial for this bank since silvergate doesnt pay any interest to holders of its trading accounts it will be more and more profitable as interest rates go up and upindeed the whole rise of cryptocurrency is based on a distrust of fiat currency and the debt levels of governments crypto in that sense works like gold as a store of value in an inflationary environment demand for crypto will increase so this will be a virtuous cycle for silvergate the inflation of the dollar will cause demand for alternative investments like crypto more and more institutions will deposit cash at silvergate in order to buy cryptocurrencies meanwhile as interest rates go up to combat inflation silvergate makes more and more money off its interestfree accountssilvergate is highly profitable even when interest rates are lowright now were in a very lowrate environment and silvergate is doing just fine with its  profit margins the bank has almost  billion in net cash but its sobering to think that if inflation starts to rise this bank will do a lot betterdespite low inflation right now people are buying crypto  not as a hedge but in the belief that these currencies will be more valuable in the future silvergate has seen dramatic growth in its deposit base and trading numbers over the last few months as ceo alan lane reported on the firstquarter  conference call in the first quarter activity on the sen continued to grow at a record pace with nearly  transactions and more than  billion in sen volumes up  on a sequential basisthis current demand for crypto can be traced to major companies supporting the currency back in the fall square nysesq announced in october  that it was buying  million worth of bitcoin and recently it bought another  million paypal holdings nasdaqpypl has also jumped into the crypto space in a major waythese moves have increased the demand for bitcoin and silvergate is seeing an influx of cash average deposits from digital currency customers grew by  billion to  billion compared to an average of  billion in the fourth quarter of  lane saidnot surprisingly the stock has zoomed higher as demand for the banks services has skyrocketedsilvergate is just getting startedwhats notable about silvergate is how small it is compared to these other crypto players square has a  billion market cap paypal is a  billion giant even coinbase is a big company with a  billion valuation silvergate is a tiny bank with a  billion market cap so its very much in its early days and theres a lot of room for this stock to run higherwhat will really be a cash cow for the bank is sen leverage as lane said on the conference call last year we introduced our collateralized lending product called sen leverage through which institutional investors receive us dollar financing by entering into a loan agreement with silvergateloaning out money is how banks make money the money silvergate has made off the sen so far is small potatoes compared to this new lending program in the first quarter silvergate announced partnerships with coinbase and fidelity to act as digital custodians these larger financial partners and others like them will store the digital currencies and silvergate will make loans using those assets as collateralas benjamin reynolds chief strategy officer for silvergate noted on the conference call were not aware of any significant new competitors that are willing to provide us dollar funding thats collateralized by bitcoin its a greenfield opportunity for the banksilvergate had amazing numbers in the first quarter with deposits more than doubling from the fourth quarter of  the bank has billions sitting in its trading accounts but the real money will be made when silvergate starts making loans to its institutional clients and charging interest thats the future for this crypto bank and it will be a highly lucrative one
