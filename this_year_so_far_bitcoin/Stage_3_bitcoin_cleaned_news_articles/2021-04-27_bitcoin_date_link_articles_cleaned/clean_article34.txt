as the ongoing digital assets boom continues to throw up myriad investment opportunities for asset managers and investors alike londonbased nickel digital asset management aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency market offering a diverse range of investment strategies across the hedge fund multistrategy and longonly spectrumlaunched in early  with its flagship digital asset arbitrage fund nickel digital has since widened its scope capitalising on the expanding opportunity set with a slew of new strategies tailored towards the growing global investor interest in digital assetsthe firm is led by three founding partners ceo anatoly crachilov cio michael hall and senior portfolio manager alek kloda before switching focus to crypto assets ceo crachilov – an investment professional with more than  years’ experience  was at goldman sachs where he focused on portfolio construction for ultrahigh net worth and family office clients earlier he had stints at jpmorgan and hsbccio michael hall began his career with bankers trust in  before focusing on directional and market neutral crypto arbitrage investing he spent over  years trading macro commodity and fixed income relative value for a number of hedge fund firms prior to nickel portfolio manager alek kloda worked for macrosynergy partners toscafund and liongatefrom those initial three founding partners nickel digital has expanded to a headcount of  with wider senior management team bringing decades of experience from morgan stanley merrill lynch ubs rothschild and bank of america earlier this month the firm hired a senior option trader with multiyear experience gained at de shaw bnp paribas and credit suisseconservative approachhaving launched just over two years ago nickel digital today manages around  million across four funds its original flagship digital asset arbitrage fund is a systematic marketneutral arbitrage hedge fund which utilises an array of trading strategies and approaches – including basis trades triangular arbitrage volatility arbitrage and calendar spreads  to profit from mispricing in bitcoin and other digital currencies“our arbitrage fund is a fully systematic fund which applies welltested techniques brought from traditional finance into crypto markets extracting value from this notoriously volatile space” ceo anatoly crachilov tells hedgeweek “this strategy does not express a view on the market directionality instead it exploits volatility swings price dislocations and the continued inefficiencies of this nascent market”the  million fund has built a solid  track record generating more than  per cent net return since inception without experiencing a single down month it has demonstrated even stronger performance this year advancing around  per cent in the first three months of “this performance is ahead of our target which is  per cent annualised on the net basis regardless of the price action of the underlying market” crachilov says of the performance“this strategy is not designed to compete with bitcoin if bitcoin repeats last year’s rally of  per cent – this strategy will not outperform this it will be aiming to achieve  to  per cent however should bitcoin go down  per cent this strategy should still be able to deliver  per cent returns in a very sustainable manner irrespective of what happens in the market”he says the fund – which is built around several trading strategies  tends to maintain an “extremely conservative” approach in a market known for its oftenvolatile movements a stance which he believes has proved pivotal in its consistent track record“we know we can extract higher returns from this market but we are consciously leaving some opportunities on the table for the sake of capital preservation”confluence of opportunitiesone of the main trading strategies within the flagship fund takes advantage of the volatility of the futures basis in this spacein contrast from its equivalent in traditional fixed income where minimal spreads can be levered tens of times in order to generate yield in crypto basis is “volatile enough as it is” and optimal yield comes from risk management and optimising the trading paths with small amounts of leverage only he explainstriangular arbitrage another substrategy borrows from traditional fx markets in which profits are generated from temporary mispricing across currency pairs in the cryptocurrency world nickel digital looks to profit from mispricing in bitcoin and a range of other digital currencies across  exchange venues“this is a lowlatency strategy which involves simultaneous trades of multiple currency pairs across a range of trading venues where triangulation can happen between san francisco london and tokyo in timeframes measured in milliseconds”another substrategy in the flagship fund is volatility arbitrage “if your implied volatility went into a massive dislocation to realised volatility the manager can take a view that this spike will mean revert to its more stable value realised volatility in this space is typically around  per cent so if your implied vol went to  or  or as in the case of march  spiked all the way to  per cent – you may take a view that it is unsustainable and short implied vol at these levels”calendar spreads meanwhile involve taking a view on for instance threemonth futures and sixmonth futures “you have the same strikes just different settlement dates so if there is a dislocation in fair value you can deploy capital to take advantage of this spread”reflecting on its performance he continues “we are converting the extremely high volatility in bitcoin which runs at  per cent into  per cent volatility of returns at the fund level that coupled with no drawdown months has resulted in a sharpe ratio of over  since inception“from my old days at goldman whenever you see a manager running a sharpe of  or  you’re naturally suspicious of them however here we are delivering a sharpe of  in a very consistent manner which is really a confluence of opportunities offered by the crypto market and our very conservative approach to risk management”building credibilitythe original fund’s strong showing in what is often an unpredictable sector ultimately helped nickel digital build credibility in the eyes of the market  paving the way for crachilov and his team to develop additional products to delve further into the broadening investor interest in digital assets“we wanted to cater to incoming demand from the traditional asset allocators and offer a range of solutions depending on investors’ particular riskreturn profile” crachilov says“while the most conservative offering was the original market neutral arbitrage strategy which does not take directional bets on cryptocurrencies with our other funds we can take more directional positions”the firm’s largest strategy is the digital gold fund a longonly buyandhold directional bitcoinfocused product currently managing  millionthe third fund the nickel digital factors fund is a multistrategy fund launched in february which some investors referred to as “millennium of crypto” in a nod to israel englander longrunning hedge fund behemoth which consists of individual pods operating different strategies under a single fund umbrella the digital factors fund has outperformed its  per cent annual return target so far delivering over  per cent annualised gain in its first two months of operation“the idea here is that you diversify your exposure across  idiosyncratic uncorrelated strategies converging into a consistent return at the fund’s level” he says “we look for talent who manage niche but high return strategies we provide the trading infrastructure risk management framework and access to capital while carefully selecting strategies that can deliver high quality consistent returns”he adds “we now have  diversified strategy pods in this fund realtime  risk management system is the core of this model allowing nickel to dynamically allocate capital as well as proactively withdraw the capital from individual strategies should they breach risk limits – even if this were to happen at  on sunday night”the most recent launch is digital leaders fund an altcoin strategy which takes a view on a broader range of protocols outside of bitcoin aiming to capture the growth of the emerging smart contract ecosystem crachilov says described as an actively managed researchdriven strategy the strategy is designed to capture early winners of what he calls a “highly innovative” areathe firm is also in the process of finalizing the launch of a defensive bitcoin fund with managed volatility profileallocator appetitetoday the firm has around  investors the majority of which are family offices while many are large sophisticated billiondollar allocators for around  per cent of them nickel digital became their firstever exposure to the cryptocurrency marketfrom nickel’s experience allocators who are willing to explore the space but are naturally concerned by volatility and downside risks of this asset class see the flagship market neutral fund as the most suitable entry point“it’s fair to say that our market neutral arbitrage fund is the one that clicks immediately in any initial conversation” he observes “indeed it gets exposure to this market without taking directionality bets instead exploiting inefficiencies and volatility embedded in this market”the natural evolution from there is a move towards with long biased exposure to baskets of cryptocurrencies which crachilov says complements the arbitrage strategy“in a portfolio you can have both and it makes perfect sense” he continues“within a welldiversified portfolio you typically have the core allocation to less volatile strategies designed to provide capital preservation while up to  per cent is typically allocated to alternatives which would include hedge funds private equity and vc exposure from a portfolio construction point of view arbitrage fits into core capital preservation bucket while directional exposure to crypto should be viewed as a vc allocation – it’s a bet on a powerful new technology which allows for instantaneous borderless value transfer converting internetofinformation into internetofvalue”assymetric assetwith bitcoin having gone mainstream and the entire scope of the digital assets ecosystem registering on a rapidlyexpanding number of radars talk turns to how the sector will continue to fare in an evershifting market landscapein an inflationary environment bitcoin offers a “completely different transparent and immutable” monetary policy in which there is a predictable supply of coins crachilov observes this stands in contrast with the traditional fiat system of dollars or euros where central banks have the sole discretion to inflate the number of units in the economy“bitcoin is an antiinflationary instrument like gold and real estate” he says “gold’s value is dictated by its scarcity similarly bitcoin’s scarcity defines its value  its completely inelastic supply model results in an upward price volatility and structural increase of demand leads to price appreciation”it is also an asymmetric asset he observes“assuming you’re making a  per cent allocation to bitcoin within your broader portfolio your downside risk is rather limited at the same time the upside of this allocation can be disproportionally large – indeed since genesis in  its annual growth of bitcoin price averaged at  per cent even with all attributed volatility bitcoin has become the best performing asset of the last decade which makes bitcoin a financially appealing allocation to contemplate as long as it’s a controlled single digit exposure”price journeythis is forming the basis of many asset managers approach to crypto which has only intensified and accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic driving bitcoin – the world’s foremost digital currency – to new record highs of more than reflecting on bitcoin’s price journey which has seen the currency spike some  per cent over the past year he continues “our analysis reveals that an allocation of mere  per cent over last eight years  which encompasses two major cycles  would have resulted in a strong contribution to the portfolio performance while not negatively impacting a portfolio’s risk profile”this again demonstrates the uncorrelated nature of bitcoin with other asset classes he adds underlying its diversifier status in an institutional portfoliomeanwhile macroeconomic backdrop remains positive for digital assets as are the opportunities in both directional and arbitrage space crachilov observes“what is critical in our business are robust risk management systems as the underlying market operates  so do the trading systems which never shut overnight or for weekends” he explains “the risk management system is designed to withstand vast market moves even if a selloff of  per cent were to take place at  on sunday morning”he adds “there will be price swings and continued volatility our two years’ experience makes us well positioned to exploit these opportunities to extract returns from the market as with any new technology in its early stage of adoption curve its price action will remain volatile and price discovery will be anything but a straight line yet the direction of travel is clear and this new technology offers a great set of investment opportunities”
