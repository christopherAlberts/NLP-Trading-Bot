like a “mainstream” financial asset is still scarcesure some banks have begun to facilitate bitcoin investments jp morgan chase is preparing to roll out a bitcoin mutual fund for instance but whether that’s an indication of its desire to offer something some customers want rather than an endorsement of the asset in principle is unclearelon musk says his tesla electric vehicle company will accept payment in bitcoin but as coindesk a crypto news service observed recently “it ain’t easy”customers have to make their payments within  minutes of making a deal or the bitcoin price expires and they have to start over tesla warns that if you make a mistake — say by entering the wrong recipient code in your bitcoin account and tesla never gets the money that’s your problemthe terms recognize that bitcoin’s value can change dramatically in the blink of an eye and that bitcoin transactions can’t be reversed even if they’re erroneous in other words why not just pay in dollars dudenewsletter get

financial instrument created by computer algorithm and valued essentially at what anyone is willing to pay for it — is arguably immune from that sort of tinkeringas an investment bitcoin has been wildly oversold by its fan base every so often someone often on reddit dredges up one of the columns i’ve written about bitcoin over the years invariably counseling readers to be wary of investing in the thing they’ll point to the latest surge in price and chortle at the folly of advising people to shun bitcoin at  when it’s now   or as it has been recently sure if you hung in with bitcoin from say  when the cryptocurrency first swam into public consciousness and was priced at a few hundred dollars per coin until today current quote on coinbase  you made a mintbut how many people did that to have stayed in the market for those eight or nine years or even for a sizable fraction of the period you would have had to survive not one not three but countless bull and bear wavesadvertisementfrom dec   to feb   bitcoin’s value fell by  this year alone there have been three downdrafts of  or more over the course of a week or two and an additional fall of  over  days in march all metrics are from coinbaseit’s true that the stock market has been no stranger to bear markets defined as drops of  or more but there have been  of those since  averaging one every six years — not three in a single yearbitcoin fanatics however don’t really pitch the cryptocurrency as an investment vehicle they pitch it as a currencyadvertisementthe problem is that as bad as bitcoin is as an investment it’s even worse as a currency blogger kevin drum lists five features that a currency should have it should be hard to counterfeit stable in value easy to carry widely accepted and  liquid bitcoin fails three of these tests — it’s not stable in value widely accepted or  liquidas i’ve written in the past the key test bitcoin passes is what we might call the kenya storefront test this derived from my sojourn as a foreign correspondent in nairobi in the  when the official exchange rate was about eight kenya shillings to the dollarexperienced foreign residents wouldn’t think of buying shillings at the official rate they’d want the black market rate which was closer to  shillings to the buckexpatriates wishing to obtain the better rate would wander into a grocery or ice cream shop owned by an indian merchant and write him a check in dollars on a us bank in return for blackmarket shillings he’d mail the check to a relative in the us or canada for deposit there and thereby spirit dollars out of kenya in contravention of the country’s strict foreignexchange regulationsadvertisementthe system served everybody except obviously the government indian families who lived in fear of being evicted from the country and their livelihoods by the kenyan regime would build up a nest egg overseas and the foreigner would double his take of shillingsi’ve often thought that bitcoin would serve those merchants down to the ground — they could convert shillings or dollars to bitcoins where they were and convert them to dollars remotelyof course the blackmarket conversions were illegal which is just another reminder that one category of users who appreciate bitcoin’s utility are criminalsadvertisementbitcoin propagandists assert that the qualities that make the cryptocurrency so useful for underground transactions are its virtue — a feature not a bug the great thing about bitcoin they say is that it operates outside national central banking systemsas coinbase explains “any two people anywhere in the world can send bitcoin to each other without the involvement of a bank government or other institution”this is supposed to be a great thing “most traditional liquid asset systems — banks credit unions brokerage houses or even hightech ones like paypal — take control of your funds and leave you subject to their terms of service” explains the personal finance site duecom “if they decide that you have violated those terms they can suspend your account”when it comes to having an account suspended for violating a financial institution’s terms of service i’m with nathan j robinson the editor of current affairs who pointed me to the above quote and who writes “this has not happened to me ever”advertisementin fact as robinson points out many of the oftbruited advantages of bitcoin — such as rocksolid “security” anonymity convenience — are either detrimental to the user or don’t really exist at allwho benefits from bitcoin security which takes the form of the impossibility of reversing a bitcoin transaction once it’s completed not the average consumer because these transactions take place without a trusted or regulated intermediary no one can rectify a bitcoin transaction with a counterparty who turns out to be fraudulenti may never have had an account suspended over terms of service but on plenty of occasions i’ve had to challenge a credit card bill or bank payment because i didn’t receive the goods or services paid for i’ve had credit and debit cards stolen and misused and the supposedly untrustworthy bank that stood between me and the thieves delivered all the compensation required by law with bitcoin forget itadvertisementthere are two keys to securing financial transactions oversight and an audit trail money in your bank account goes astray and the bank’s records will almost always show what happened and correct the error with bitcoin there’s no oversight and no audit trail — and that’s supposed to be a plusit’s worth noting that “security” in the bitcoin context doesn’t mean “security from loss” the most spectacular loss may be the one connected with the defunct bitcoin exchange known as mt gox in which the customer holdings gone astray were at one point estimated at  trillion the losses are almost certainly less than that but some customers will never recover their full holdingsthere are many other episodes in which bitcoin accounts have been hacked by cyberthieves or lost when their owners misplace their access codes which can’t be replicatednothing in the bitcoin universe resembles the fdic or securities investor protection corp us government agencies that protect bank and brokerage customers from losses of as much as  fdic or  sipc if their financial institution failsadvertisementconvenience the bitcoin annals bristle with yarns about users who lost their passcodes or “seeds” — phrases that can be used to recover access to a bitcoin account — or have had to go to extraordinary lengths to protect these codes from thieves“store your seed securely” advises a user on reddit “i used a metal stamp to punch my seed into a ¼ inch steel plate after that i dipped it in plastisol so it cannot be read and stored it in my safe with a description written on the outside i also had another copy of the seed stored behind a picture at a trusted family member’s house just in case”as matt levine of bloomberg observes “everything i read about bitcoin storage is utterly exhausting”bitcoin isn’t a mainstream asset by any stretch of the imagination drum likens it to collectibles like baseball cards albeit “a collectible that’s gotten a lot of hype” it has no intrinsic value it doesn’t represent even a theoretical claim on a national hoard of gold for instanceadvertisementits worth is dependent on two interrelated factors the desire of bitcoin fans to keep buying and holding and an artificially created scarcity according to its creation document the maximum number of bitcoins that can be “minted” through a process of algorithmsolving by powerful computers is  million about  million are already in circulationso invest in bitcoins if you wish try to buy a tesla with them if you have the patience but they’re such a pain to manage that the smartest way to get a piece of the action is the way smart gold bugs invest in that metal — they don’t buy bullion but stocks in firms in the gold industry you can now do that with bitcoin thanks to a certain “watershed” ipo
