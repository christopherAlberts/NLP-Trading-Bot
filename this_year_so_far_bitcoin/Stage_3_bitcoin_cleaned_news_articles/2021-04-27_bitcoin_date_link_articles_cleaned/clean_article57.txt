it’s not about perfection it’s about being the better alternative that’s it you’re not saying i’m the most efficient thing that’s ever been created in human history things will get more and more efficient because of economic competition what you’re saying is i’m more efficient than the alternative usesthere’s no split there’s a completely separate network that is passing off and pretending to be they’re different chains so btc is not bitcoin under legal terminology its basically called passing off its misrepresenting themselves as if they were bitcoindr craig s wrightthe two quotes above are big statements both taken from the sixth video in ryan x charles’s theory of bitcoin the bitcoin whitepaper series with the whitepaper’s author dr craig s wright economic competition and incentives are at the heart of the bitcoin system he invented a system that is completely different than the system that falls under the btc ticker symbol throughout this episode charles and dr wright go through the proof of work pow and network sections of the whitepaper line by line and these are my key takeaways from the discussionwhy powso what in the world is pow anyway as described by my friends at bitcoin sv academy “proof of work is the term used when explaining the rules that decide who gets to update transactions on the bitcoin blockchain” the “who” refers to nodes miners and in order to be the node that updates the next block of transactions and receive the coveted block reward the node needs to provide proof that they have solved a computational challengewhile this may sound rather complicated it’s more important to understand why pow exists as opposed to exactly how it works the point here is that once pow has been performed the block is complete and cannot be undone without redoing the work as more blocks are built on top of that block all of those subsequent blocks would have to be redone as well in other words pow is what ensures immutabilitypow is not really the security mechanism of the bitcoin system widely distributed hashes are rather it’s a way of allowing nodes to compete with each other for a node to find a block complete it and signal its completion to the network it shows they are serious and invested in what they are doing as we learned from video five in this series signaling is importantpow vs pos and the dangers of too many nodesif there are too many nodes on the network dr wright explains that it’s impossible to take action against them if there is fraud and therefore you can’t trust anything for these reasons dr wright abandoned the idea of a proof of stake or “pos” system a system where a person can mine or validate block transactions according to how many coins they hold…a system that ethereum is transitioning to and went with pow for bitcoin a pos system is “easy to game” he saysfirst of all with pos there could be collusion issues second of all the nodes would not be tied to a location as the full nodes are that mine bitcoin validating blocks would no longer mark where a node exists there’s also an ability to set up fractional ownership with pos a huge number of smaller nodes could secretly be aligned and there is no way of telling in order for the system to work we need to know who the nodes are so we can hold them accountable“that’s the bit that everyone keeps forgetting the reason for determining is so that you can actually attribute and if you can say this guy with  of the hash power has now double spent or done something wrong you can attribute that to them” dr wright explainswith bitcoin if  of the network attacks you would know what miners represent the  of the network “it’s really hard to hide a really large mining farm” dr wright points outthe role of incentiveswith mining on bitcoin dr wright has created an environment where nodes build and invest in infrastructure and this is because they are incentivized to do socharles and dr wright discuss how there are people that say there should be pow with a continuous equal block reward forever no halving and just have it as a constant inflation rate dr wright explains the problem with this sort of thinking is that there is not an incentive to improve why bother growing the network why build and scale if you’re going to be rewarded with the same amount no matter what what incentive would you have anymorein addition to scaling and growing the network the incentives are there to make it irrational for nodes to be anything other than honest pow is a “deanonymization” technique and there’s literally no hiding nodes can be pinpointed and they know thisi love how dr wright brought human nature and tendencies into bitcoin the theory behind bitcoin is not just computer science dr wright is incredibly wellversed in the study of criminality and economic incentives to name a few and he explains that economic criminals are more rational than the average person he refers to them as “hyperrational”according to dr wright economic criminals take morality out of the equation and do not care what’s right or wrong they care “purely from a utilitybased outcome” since criminals are rational if you set everything up for them so they know they are going to lose money if they don’t follow the rules then you don’t need to worry it’s more profitable for nodes to act legallypeak vs nonpeaktowards the end of the episode charles and dr wright dive into the ‘network’ section of the whitepaper and discuss some potential future scenarios with the bitcoin network“there will be differences with how people interact on the system especially when you look at peak vs nonpeak time” dr wright revealsa possible scenario could be that transaction fees go up peak time and users will have to pay more for transactions to go through quickly on the other hand if once a day is good enough for example perhaps users could work out some sort of a deal with a miner where the transactions are processed every  hours and the fees are taken out thendr wright explains that as the network scales and it becomes more difficult to send a block around as they will be so big transacting will be broken down into peak times and low times and the fees will change accordingly similar to how electricity is billed think of a day like black friday in the us for shopping not poker it will be more expensive to transact during a time when huge amounts of people are shopping and transacting for example it’s a supply and demand equationnew to bitcoin check out coingeek’s bitcoin for beginners
