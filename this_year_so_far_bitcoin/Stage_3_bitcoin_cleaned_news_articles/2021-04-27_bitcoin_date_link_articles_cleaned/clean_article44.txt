david booth became a billionaire patiently adhering to a philosophy of betting undervalued stocks over the past several years that patience has been tested as socalled value stocks endured one of their worst stretches in memory now booth says those stocks are making a comeback — even as he doubts the stock market powered by the runaway gains of tech and other growth stocks is in a bubblebooth cofounded his private investment firm dimensional fund advisors dfa in  from the spare bedroom of his brooklyn apartment he took an academic approach to investing after studying at the university of chicago under a professor who would eventually win the nobel prize for research on the “efficient market hypothesis” — which essentially says you can’t beat the market since then booth has become a staple in the value investing world and dfa has grown to have  billion in assets under management and more than  employees after four decades the firm sticks to the same basic principle investors can’t beat the market but they can lean into factors like value and profitability eyeing stocks that have a higher value on the books than the cheap price they’re trading at on the marketvalue investors though have recently been disappointed as fastgrowing companies like netflix and amazon have driven stock market returns from august  to midapril  the russell  value index has lagged behind the russell  growth index by  percentage points a year according to morningstar while value stocks have just recently made a small comeback it’s too early to tell if the pendulum is actually swinging that way againso should investors give up on value stocks for good is the stock market about to burst is the crypto frenzy dangerous here’s booth on all that and more this interview has been edited and condensed for clarityare we in a stock market bubbleno individuals have great shortterm memory markets typically don’t markets go up and go down and they go up and down in unpredictable ways in the last  years we frequently had people call in saying “the market’s near its alltime high what do you think” well i think there’s kind of an order in the universe stocks have a higher expected return than bonds and bonds have a higher expected return than money market instruments that’s the way it works out over long periods of timewhat moves should investors make right nowif you say “well what about the short term” — trying to get on shortterm market movements is more like gambling the last year if anything has shown the tremendous cost of trying to time those things and not getting it right at the end of march last year a lot of people got out of the stock market and it has done over  since then you want to have a longterm focus something you can stick with people talk about the “new normal” all the time and if we look somewhere in the future it will be the next normal too it’s about uncertainty and sources of uncertainty change over time but the marketplace does a really good job of sorting through thatis value investing really deadover the long haul research shows that value stocks on average outperform growth we think there’s a good reason for that it’s lowerpriced stocks and basically the lower price you pay for something the higher the eventual return in the last few years it hasn’t been there — that’s kind of the nature of premiums in general but over the last year it’s been really quite different value has come back the way we think it ought to at the end of the day it’s always about uncertainty if there is no uncertainty about the future then your investment return would be basically a money market a riskless asset return on one hand people shrink away from uncertainty naturally and on the other hand it’s uncertainty that creates the opportunity to do better than a moneymarkettype of fund during the first decade of this millennium when value was doing really well we didn’t shout our lungs out if you’re a value investor you have to be prepared for those kinds of times when they’re going to underperformhas the definition of a value stock changed overtimevalue is kind of in the eye of the beholder we started our value strategies in  and typically rely on pricetobook  other people have come in with other definitions and a lot of them have advantages the reason we like pricetobook primarily is it typically ends up with lower turnover rates and it’s also less manipulatable earnings have a better chance of being manipulated there are ways of smoothing earnings that aren’t there with book valuewhat about bitcoin will it stick around or is it a bubblei don’t think it’s a bubble but it’s kind of like a gambling casino there’s really no income that comes from bitcoin so you really just have to bet that if you’re buying it it goes up i think there are some great opportunities for bitcoin and i think there are some major concerns it’s a speculative investment and speculative investments tend to go up and down starting with the tulip bulbs over the last  years we’ve seen these things go up and down i don’t know why bitcoin would be any different other than it’s still at a relatively early stage so you could make the argument that it’s going to be a long time before it’s fully priced i’m not making that argument either that’s just why i’m not forecasting it’s a bubble but you ought to be concerned about itwill the gamestop trading frenzy and other events like it change the way people investno whatever your view is about investing there are always some stocks or bonds that fall outside that can’t be explained by your view of the world gamestop is one of those things where you have enormous amounts of people betting that gamestop’s stock will go up and enormous amounts of people betting that it will go down but by and large so many of those are shortterm investors which gets back to the idea that — to the extent that shortterm investors are moving the price around — we always view that as gambling and we try to avoid that when we canshould investors worry about inflationi think we should be worried i’m worried about inflation when we started the firm inflation was around  and treasury bonds were yielding over  — it was a different world  years ago there’s no reason it can’t happen again i’m not planning that it’s going to happen in the next  months but if you’re a longterm investor you’ve got to think about these long term issues what happens if there’s inflation what happens if there’s deflation what happens if there are high interest rates figure out what your goals are figure out the range of outcomes that can happen with different scenarios and then figure out which one seems sensiblemore from moneythe classic  investing strategy could now be working against youa beginner’s guide
