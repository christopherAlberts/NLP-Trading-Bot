“it’s a really tricky needle to thread” that’s how former federal reserve economist claudia sahm describes the task at hand for chair jerome powell at the fed meeting this week bitcoin btc traders aren’t sure he can pull it offconsidering the massive economic dislocation over the past year from the coronavirus the current level of interest rates and monetary stimulus appears to be just right and data on everything from inflation to employment is about as good as one might hopepowell’s challenge will be to convince investors the fed can maintain the pristine conditions even as the economy reactivates potentially sparking a surge in consumer demand that could lead to faster inflation investors will be watching for any advance indications as to how quickly output would have to ramp up before the fed moves to taper its  billionamonth of bond purchases – an extreme form of loose monetary policy – and eventually raises interest rates currently set at near it’s a key question for traders in the market for bitcoin seen by many big institutional investors as a hedge against the runaway inflation that might transpire if the fed were to lose control at issue is the credibility and resolve of the federal open market committee or fomc which is the panel at the us central bank that sets monetary policysubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and

“like if things get out of hand they will adjust they will raise rates but they don’t want them to think they’re going to raise rates”according to economists at bank of america the secondbiggest us bank investors in traditional markets will be focused on whether powell shifts his language around when “substantial further progress” will have been made in the economyeconomists at bank of the west

conference with powell is right afterward at  pmthe federal reserves balance sheet has swelled to nearly  trillion from about  trillion a little over a year ago source federal reserve bank of st louisthe fomc decision will be closely scrutinized by traders in the bitcoin market especially because this year’s  price rally fueled by speculation that faster inflation might be on the way has stalled out in recent weeks as of early tuesday bitcoin was changing hands around  it’s bitcoin of course where price volatility is the norm so anything can happen but the largest cryptocurrency is well off its alltime high price reached earlier this month around the fed meeting follows a string of several weeks of positive economic datathe us added  jobs in march far above the expected  with pandemicwrecked portions of the economy like leisure and hospitality leading the wayus headline inflation in march came in at  over the prior  months slightly faster than the expected  based on the labor department’s consumer price index cpi even that result might not be anathema to the fed since powell has explicitly expressed his wish for inflation to average over  at least for a whilegross

bostjancic chief us financial economist for the forecasting firmsuch momentum means that markets may see a more relaxed and confident powell on wednesday said steven kelly a research associate at the yale program on financial stability an initiative focused on understanding financial crises“if you would have offered everyone on the fomc the last six weeks of data they would have accepted the deal” kelly said “if we were in  and cpi was bumping up a little higher in a way that hadn’t been communicated there would be volatility in the bond market but they’ve been very clear that inflation will bump above ”with the yield on  us treasury notes around  down from as high as  in march there’s little pressure on the fed to consider experimental monetary policies like “operation twist” and “yield curve control” that might loosen financial conditions furtherinflationadjusted yields on  treasurys – the nominal yield minus the inflation rate – are at negative levels said bostjancic they’re currently around  down from  before the pandemic on that basis the  yield could climb roughly  percentage point before conditions returned to prepandemic levels in other words powell’s got plenty of headroom on that fronteven though oxford projects  for the nominal  treasury yield by the end of the year the numbers add up to “near the easiest financial conditions we’ve ever had” bostjancic addedthe fomc will likely stay the course on keeping the target rate for federal funds in a range of  to  while maintaining the monthly asset purchases at  billion of us treasury bonds and  billion of

americans unemployed there’s a long way before full employment is reached powell has talked about this and it’s likely to be on the agenda again at this week’s fomc meetinglower unemployment could force businesses to compete for the shrinking pool of available labor leading to higher wages but higher inflation could also increase the cost of living hurting the lowest income earners in societyone tradeoff is that inflation makes it easier for borrowers to repay debt sahm said“it helps borrowers on the reverse side” sahm said “if there’s higher inflation and wages tend to grow faster than prices that means it takes less of your money down the road to pay back the bank … most economists who are rich people do not talk about the distributional effects of inflation”what makes bitcoin traders skeptical is the socalled goldilocks scenario that everything stays exactly as it is for the fed meeting this week rising gradually and in sync corporations see increased profits as consumer demand rises thanks to the federal reserve’s accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus from the us government investors benefit from an uplift of asset prices inflation ticks up a bit but not too much eventually the fed has enough legroom to remove the monetary stimulus“the fed will eventually slow down the asset purchases and probably end the asset purchases” sahm said “the whole point of this is to get the us economy to a better place if the economy is in a better place we’re in a good place to invest and asset prices go up”
