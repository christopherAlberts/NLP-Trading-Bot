some cryptocurrency players are trying to shrink crypto’s carbon footprint with a selfregulating accord but critics say it distracts from more effective government regulationan earlier version of this article stated that argo blockchain had joined the caa last week the company is in discussions with the caa about joining the pact this is reflected in the current versionin a banner year for cryptocurrencies so far not all of the news is going to be goodas bitcoin and other digital coins have soared in value since january the toll they are taking on planet earth has garnered far more attentionhighprofile bitcoin supporters have come out in force to defend their favourite cryptocurrency a report published last week – sponsored by tesla inc’s elon musk square inc’s jack dorsey and ark’s cathie wood one of wall street’s hottest investment pros – depicts bitcoin as an “ideal” part of renewable energy projects involving solar wind and battery storage technologymeanwhile a coalition of crypto firms and organisations earlier this month announced the crypto climate accord cca an industrydriven pact in which signatories vow to switch to renewable energy sources to power operations by  and go completely netzero – eliminating greenhouse gas emissions altogether – by but in an age in which previously unrepentant big polluters are suddenly finding a green conscience questions abound as to whether the accord is a gamechanger or simply a greenwash of a growing problembitcoin mining – in which powerful computer rigs around the world race to verify transactions in the hope of winning new bitcoins – consumes as much electricity annually as the entire country of argentina researchers at the university of cambridge estimatesupporters of the accord say that massive carbon footprint – rather than the growing public outcry over it – is motivating them to roll their sleeves up and get down to businesswe recognise that crypto does use a lot of energy so let’s make

regulation which advocates for a fair financial system and energy web foundation which focuses on opensource technologies to accelerate the lowcarbon transition“we recognise that crypto does use a lot of energy so let’s make it  green” jesse morris chief commercial officer at energy web told al jazeerarather than “a political handshaking thing” morris says the accord is a “tool box for action” that aims to generate a critical mass of crypto firms following a decarbonisation plan“if you are a bitcoin miner building out applications we want you” he saidbut critics charge that a selfregulated accord could get in the way of more effective government policies for reining in crypto emissionsa brake on effective regulationthe accord has picked up plenty of highprofile supporters ranging from french electric utility engie and billionaire former us presidential hopeful tom steyer to the entities behind the cryptocurrency xrp often referred to as “ripple”monica long the general manager of the ripplex payment platform told al jazeera that her company plans to become carbon neutral by  aligning it with other members of the accordon that front ripple has something of a leg upbitcoin has such a massive carbon footprint because it relies on something known as a proof of work pow consensus to validate transactions and create and distribute new coins the most competitive “mining rigs” that race to verify transactions for the reward of new bitcoins are often comprised of thousands of computers labouring in unison and eating up massive amounts of energyby contrast ripple does not reward mining activities with new coins instead it uses a less energyintensive consensus protocol to validate account balances and transactions in the systemother lesserknown cryptocurrencies use proof of stake pos – also a far less energyintensive method of verifying transactions because mining power is not determined by how many computers are crunching numbers at once but by how many coins

globally is powered by fossil fuels and about  percent of mining is located in china where coalfired power does the majority of the heavy lifting some observers say the accord could get in the way of more effective governmentdriven solutions to crypto’s carbon problem“to stop the climate disaster that bitcoin is causing governments need to ban pow mining” pete howson an environmental researcher at northumbria university told al jazeera “the crypto climate accord by representing the interests of bitcoin miners puts the brakes on that sort of effective regulation”howson also believes that the relatively smallscale mining startups that have joined the cca represent “a drop in the ocean” given the scale of the problem“even if new bitcoin mining ventures open up and commit to using only leftover renewables miners in other parts of the world – where renewable infrastructure doesn’t exist – have to work harder buying more servers and burning more fossil fuels” he added‘need to get it right’argo blockchain which went public on the london stock exchange in  is in discussions with the cca about joiningthe firm first set up mining facilities in quebec with cheap hydropower argo ceo peter wall told al jazeera“it’s important for me as an individual and as a company not to be using fossil fuels particularly coal to mine bitcoin” he said “if bitcoin is the reserve asset of the

traceability and verification are concerned“we need to get it right to make sure  are in line with other standards and avoid the appearance of greenwashing or astroturfing” said wallanother mining company that has been in discussions with cca organisers about joining is gryphon digital mining which uses only uses lowcost offgrid hydroelectric power from upstate new york for its operationsbilling itself as the first bitcoin mining company committed to  renewables gryphon is hoping it can indeed prove that there does not have to be a tradeoff between financial success and the climate“these are the early days for crypto” dan tolhurst gryphon’s cofounder told al jazeera “consumers and investors vote with their wallets for companies that are responsible citizens”
