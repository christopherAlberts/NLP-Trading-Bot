district wearing designer hightops black jeans and matching sweatshirts made by the highend streetwear brand heron preston the sweatshirts—cameron’s is red tyler’s white—are emblazoned with a nasa logo which the twins picked because it echoes the spaceexploration theme behind the brand of their sevenyearold cryptocurrency trading operation gemini in addition to being the zodiac sign symbolised by twins it was the name of nasa’s second space mission—the one just prior to apollo  which put the first man on the moon“we actually call our employees astronauts” cameron says “we’re all astronauts

chumps played by armie hammer in the social network the hit  movie about facebook at harvard classmate mark zuckerberg had swiped their idea for a social networking site building an empire with  billion worldwide users and a personal fortune now worth  billion a dozen years after they settled with zuckerberg for  million in facebook stock and cash the winklevii as they are widely known have emerged as leaders of a technological movement whose core operating principle involves digitising the records of all assets globally decentralising control and cutting out gatekeepers—including facebookblockchain the technology underlying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is already disrupting money and banking as giant financial firms such as paypal square jpmorgan fidelity and northern trust embrace bitcoin and jockey for position in a future awash in digital assets at the same time big companies including boeing samsung tesla and novartis are using the new technology to improve their supply chains share customer data and speed up business processes in some cases they’re adding bitcoin to their balance sheets in  bitcoin returned more than  percent against  percent for the sp within  hours of meeting with the winklevoss twins in  griffin left and duncan cock foster had received an overture from gemini to buy nifty gateway the nft auction house was recently valued at  billionimage michael prince for forbesthe winklevii say they’re just getting started through their holding company gemini space station which owns their crypto exchange and nifty gateway and via investments made by their family office winklevoss capital the duo have invested in no fewer than  digitalasset startups these fledgling companies are laying the foundation for what the brothers hope will be a new virtual world that they and others call the “metaverse” in which digital assets like art music real estate and even entire businesses are created bought and sold—and most importantly governed—by the blockchain many of the companies they’re backing are positioned to thrive in this threedimensional version of the internet ruled via peertopeer computer networks where participants rather than powerful companies profit“the idea of a centralized social network is just not going to exist five or  years in the future” tyler predicts when asked about facebook “there’s a membrane or a chasm between the old world and this new cryptonative universe and we’re the conduit helping people transcend the offline into the online”the fact that two greenwich connecticut–raised men of harvard both former olympians find themselves at the centre of an antiestablishment movement whose most notable use case to date has been a thriving online bazaar selling illegal drugs speaks volumes about how far the winklevii have come from their days in cambridge massachusetts grappling with mark zuckerbergafter settling their arbitration with facebook and competing in the  olympics in beijing the winklevoss brothers headed to oxford university to earn their mbas in  and then formed winklevoss capital to make venture investments eager to join the cadre of firms on sand hill road funding today’s great technology companies the twins soon realised they were effectively shunned in silicon valley startup after startup fearful of reprisals from juggernaut facebook and its growing network refused to take their capitalas recounted in ben mezrich’s  book bitcoin billionaires it was during a vacation in ibiza in june  that the twins were first introduced to bitcoin by early adopters who like the winklevii were traditionaltech outsiders the notion that money was the ultimate social network and that bitcoin was free from centralbank control and backed by mathematical certainty appealed to the highly disciplined athletesafter the brothers returned to new york they began using their facebook money to buy up bitcoin “we found the community superwelcoming” says tyler who tends to be the more analytical twin cameron is the more creativein may  they invested  million in a brooklynbased exchange called bitinstant which charged people a fee to exchange dollars for bitcoin in just minutes the business grew rapidly—reportedly accounting for  percent of all bitcoin purchases unfortunately some of those purchases were laundering money for drug dealers selling on the darkweb drug bazaar silk road and by the end of the year the site was shuttered its computergenius ceo charlie shrem whom the winklevii embraced was arrested and spent a year in federal prison for running an unlicenced operation“we very much saw ourselves in duncan and griffin ” says tyler second from right of the cock foster twins “these guys had this passion this conviction and everyone around them was saying they were crazy that’s how we felt our whole life”image michael prince for forbesfacing another brush with ignominy the brothers decided that if they were going to succeed in this nascent marketplace they needed to be handson—and more importantly they needed to bring order to a chaotic unregulated industry in  they founded their own crypto­currency exchange geminiin the early days gemini was little more than a place to buy and sell bitcoin but today it offers trading and custody for  cryptocurrencies including ether a coin equipped with a native computer language that lets developers build applications without central servers zcash a privacyprotecting token based on bitcoin and mana the native cryptocurrency of a virtualreality world called decentraland the twins also have their own ethereumbased token called gemini dollar which is pegged to the value of the us dollar and therefore stableamong crypto exchanges there are now more than  gemini became in october  one of the first bitcoinfocussed financial institutions to be designated a trust bank by the new york state department of financial services this meant it was subject to the same regulatory requirements as banks like state street and northern trust and enabled it to take deposits in all  statesthough gemini’s trading volume  billion in the last  months is much lower than that of giants like binance and coinbase it rivals them in industry “trust” scores given the current environment of nosebleed valuations like coinbase’s  billion gemini could likely fetch  billion if it ever needed outside fundingwhile facebook’s early corporate mantra was “move fast and break things” the winklevii who famously asked then–harvard president larry summers to enforce the college’s “standards of conduct” against zuckerberg have always operated under an “ask permission first not forgiveness later” ethos a poster on the wall of their office from gemini’s recent new york subway marketing campaign depicts the founding fathers of the us with the words the revolution needs rulesheavily promoting its operation as the “regulated” crypto exchange gemini is positioning itself to profit when the securities and exchange commission finally approves crypto exchangetraded funds already approved in canada and overseas starting in  the winklevii began applying to the sec to launch a bitcoin etf so far they’ve been turned down twice last in  over “the immaturity of the industry”today there are six crypto etf applications pending at the sec from the likes of wisdom tree van eck fidelity first trust and anthony scaramucci’s skybridge financial gemini which now offers customers a bitcoin rewards credit card and a savings account that pays  percent interest on crypto deposits has an application pending with the sec to open an alternative marketplace for trading stocks and other securities issued on a blockchain“gemini is the bridge where people can migrate away from centralised finance from their current bank and into this new world” cameron says “our business model is not based on information or monetising privacy it’s based on marketplaces and trading fees”this story appears in the  may

showing more potential than its nft marketplace auction platform nifty gatewaythe company was founded in november  by duncan and griffin cock foster  also identical twins and rowers who say they took up the sport after watchingin high school both had just graduated from college in —duncan from washington university in st louis with a degree in computer science and griffin from emory in mathematics during his senior year duncan began dabbling in cryptokitties a digital craze similar to the decadesago mania for beanie babies only one in which users create collect and trade unique animated felines registering each using a nonfungible token on the ethereum blockchain“everyone had the same complaint” duncan said in a  interview “buying nfts was too complicated we started nifty gateway to solve access issues and we will not rest until  billion people are collecting nfts”at first the cock fosters designed nifty gateway not as an nft auction platform but simply as a way to buy nfts with mastercards and visas instead of going through the arduous process of purchasing them with ether in fact the winklevii first stumbled upon nifty gateway in july  at the contemporary and digital art fair in new york a work called “cryptopunk ” featuring a woman with a mohawk smoking a cigarette rendered in the blocky style of an oldfashioned video game had caught tyler’s eye the image was one of  similar but unique portraits created by google veterans matt hall and john watkinson and initially given away free the price was  tyler used his phone to create an account on nifty gateway paying with his credit cardas soon as the winklevii returned to their office gemini’s vice president of engineering eric winer told them he had been keeping an eye on nifty gateway which had just emerged from adam draper’s boostvc accelerator boot camp a month later gemini struck a deal to buy the sevenmonthold startup the cock fosters moved to an airbnb in brooklyn and worked with gemini’s engineers to build what is now the world’s most exclusive digitalart platform while numerous digital platforms operate more like ebay and are open to all creators nifty gateway selectively curates its artists and sells their works in “drops” taking a page from fashion brands like nike and supremethe nft art market has exploded in february nifty gateway accounted for  million of the  million in nft art auctioned on the top seven online platforms according to data compiled by cryptoartio as of late march it had sold  million of the  million worth of such work bought by collectors when the cock fosters launched nifty gateway a year ago monthly sales were less than  nft artist has gotten richer off the craze than mike winkelmann aka beeplecrap a  father of two in charleston south carolina who earned a computer science degree at purdue and studied no art past high school he uses  software to generate artwork that is often revolting one piece depicts a naked donald trump eating a hamburger while sitting atop a train wreck that’s being consumed by giant coronavirus particlesas a hobby beeple created a digital image every day for more than ten years posting his provocative “everydays” depicting dystopian visions of pop culture and politics to social media sites like facebook and instagram the work earned him a cult following on the internet but he couldn’t monetise the digital medium which was as easy to copy as simply rightclicking a mouselast fall nifty gateway began reaching out to artists trying to populate its new exclusive platform with interesting and valuable digital art given beeple’s  million instagram followers he was an obvious choice after educating winkelmann about nfts engineers at nifty gateway explained how he could program art to be dynamic changing at different points in time or based on a given outcome he was already touching on political themes in his “everydays” and saw the  election as his opportunity to make a markif trump were reelected beeple’s “crossroad” nft would transform into a naked sweaty muscular strongman walking menacingly through fire if he lost the nft would turn into a looping video of trump lying facedown beneath a rainbow with words like loser painted on his naked body as a bird styled after twitter’s logo chirped away on october  “crossroad” became the hottest ticket on nifty gateway selling for  to a  miamibased digitalasset speculator with a columbia mba the buyer put the work back up for sale on nifty gateway and sold it in february for  million making a  profit beeple earned about  due to the platform’s fee structure which invites artists to collect a  percent royalty on all aftermarket salesdrops beeple auctioned for  each now trade for hundreds of thousands of dollars earning him at least  per transaction his various nfts sold for a total of  million on nifty gateway in the weeks before his  million sale on march  the winklevii’s nft platform which charges artists  percent has been a lifechanger for winkelmann it has also created a booming business for nifty gateway“we’re doing  million in five minutes now” says cameron of drops that a year ago would have brought  on a good day adds tyler “basically the entire art world the entire entertainment world is knocking down the door”the gold rush in digital art and collectibles being minted and sold on nifty gateway and other nft platforms like nba top shot won’t last forever but just as some dotcombubble companies like amazon survived and eventually thrived the winklevii are building nifty gateway and gemini for the long run as a marketplace and custodian for all manner of assets “you want to pick that niche” cameron says “you don’t want to boil the ocean”ultimately the twins see their two marketplaces gemini and nifty gateway integrated into a single dashboard where nfts will be used as collateral for loans tyler and cameron also envision a future in which the due diligence they perform to verify a user’s identity could be issued as an nft—think facebook but with irrefutable identity confirmation “it’s almost like compliance as a service could be baked into an nft token that gemini issued” tyler saysanother major area of investment for the winklevii is blockchainbased applications that support decentralisation—the idea that tech companies like google facebook and microsoft will no longer be necessary because web services and applications will be created operated and governed by usersback in  winklevoss capital joined forces with san francisco’s opensource developer protocol labs investing in a seed round to finance various projects that would create a new internet infrastructure that doesn’t rely on centralised servers one of its efforts filecoin is intended to power a network for computer storage in which users around the world rent out their unused harddrive space and in return receive ethereum blockchain–based tokens called filecoins as payment there are already  such computers or “nodes” linked into a decentralised cloud computer filecoin has recently been on a tear its tokens have surged  percent so far this year and it has a market capitalisation in excess of  billionin june protocol labs is hosting a workshop to build decentralised versions of amazon google and facebook that instead of relying on revenue from advertising targeting their users’ personal information will reward them with filecoin tokens one day filecoinconnected computers could rival the cloud services of these tech giantsoasis labs based in san francisco is another promising winkleviiowned startup run by a security and artificialintelligence professor at the university of california at berkeley the company specialises in ultrasensitive data like human genome codes the idea is that users will control their own data and be compensated for its use by corporationsthe twins’ most recent investment artie builds video games that don’t need to be downloaded and ingame digital assets that can be exported traded on open markets and even imported into competing games artie’s “appless” games use assets issued on the ethereum blockchain and can stream from anywhere similar to how youtube embed codes allow its videos to be played on any websitebillionaire zynga founder and ceo mark pincus is among the investors in artie as is youtube cofounder chad hurley “we’re seeing that consumers want to break down these walled gardens” says artie cofounder armando kirwin “they want more choices they don’t want monopolies they want a return to the free and open web and that’s the last sanctuary that we have”of course the irony of any effort to build a decentralised metaverse is that its chief architects will ultimately become unnecessary tyler and cameron wink­levoss seem unconcerned goldman sachs recently predicted that the price of bitcoin could easily climb to  in the next five years“decentralisation is a spectrum” says cameron looking out of his window towards new york’s chrysler building “our goal was not to be the gatekeepers”
