cryptocurrencies rise so too stablecoinsamongst economical uncertainty and global financial instability cryptocurrencies have been evolving rapidly cast aside as ‘fake’ online money by the masses for years the canyon between fiat and crypto was stark until stablecoins began to bridge the gap paired directly to fiat currency prices stablecoins have provided the muchneeded stability required for many merchants global institutions and countries to participate in the crypto spaceas the demand for cryptocurrencies continues to rise so too does the demand for stablecoins and their development this is evidenced by the current stablecoin market capitalization market cap of almost  billion – up over  percent since though stablecoins have revolutionized the world of crypto and provided interoperability there are always pros and cons for examplethe stability of a stablecoin is directly linked to the asset it is tied to if the asset falls so too does the stablecoin in the event of a fiat ‘flashcrash’ the stablecoin too will plummet in valuethe aim of the crypto space geared towards decentralization stablecoins aim to reduce volatility but in doing so become in part centralized – thus opposing the purpose of cryptoinvestors are not as interested in stablecoins in comparison to cryptocurrencies due to minimal change in price fluctuationscustodial risk onchain overcollateralization of collateralized stablecoinsfrax attempts to remedy these aforementioned pitfalls and risks by providing the first trustless stablecoin protocol the frax protocol utilizes algorithmic central banking which conceptually algorithmically modifies supply to ensure that price stability remains constantthis article will break down the complexity of the frax protocol and portray the impact of frax on the adapting world of stablecoinswhat is fraxpartcollateralized partalgorithmically stabilized stablecoin frax is the world’s first fractionalalgorithmic stablecointhe frax protocol is ideologically pure extremely stable and highly scalable onchain money that consists of a twotoken system the stablecoin frax frax and the governance token frax shares fxsa stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that aims to provide price stability by linking with a reserve asset – usually fiat as opposed to standard stablecoins algorithmic stablecoins maintain price stability by generating or burning the number of stablecoinsdigital tokens availableif the price rises above  the algorithmic system produces new stablecoins until the price returns to  this process works in reverse via the burning of available stablecoinstokenshow does it workthe frax stablecoin protocol is both fractional and algorithmic receiving its name frax from the protocol’s fractionalalgorithmic stability mechanism the frax stablecoin supply is the first collateralalgorithmic of its kind this symbiotic combination functions to maintain stability like soif frax trades below  the protocol increases the collateral ratio – in steps of if frax trades above  the protocol decreases the collateral ratio – also in steps of through governance the refresh rate and step parameters can be adjusted to suit the stablecoin purpose and ensure stability through economic changes rather than obtaining a usd price by averaging the prices of stablecoin pools on uniswap frax does it differently calculating a timeweighted average of the uniswap pair price and the ethusd chainlink oracle the frax protocol is able to obtain a true usd pricemoving the stablecoin space forwardas opposed to other stablecoins frax’s fractionalalgorithmic protocol ensures that price fluctuations are met with fractional algorithmic responses to maintain true usd price stability amalgamating the combination of fractional stability and algorithmic mechanisms the frax protocol aims to further develop the stablecoin space through fxsthe fxs governance token recently introduced the algorithmic market operations controller amo an amo automates the arbitrary frax monetary policy to ensure collateral ratio does not decrease and alter the price and stability of frax for the first time in human history fxs facilitates a completely decentralized system that is not hindered or controlled by a national state or corporation performing open market operations algorithmically amo controllers cannot mint an amount of frax that would destabilize the peg this ensures frax’s base layer stability remains untouched and ideologically puremany stablecoin errors and instabilities have appeared since their creationwhen compared to tether – whose price lacked all stability at moments – the frax protocol prevents price slipping below or above  though the stablecoin tether’s history has always shown quick recovery that never prevented the price from collapsing to lows of  or rising to highs of when compared to the likes of dai and other collateralized stablecoins the clear advantage of the frax stablecoin is reduced risk of overcollateralization when stablecoins like dai and others rely wholly on collateral they risk moments of instability when rapid changes such as flashcrashes occur furthermore collateralbacking the supply of stablecoins can be a very expensive venture the frax protocol consistently reduces this expense and replaces it with algorithmic measures – effectively cutting costs on the supply side by reducing dai’s hyper collateralization with a cr settled by the market  at the momentalgorithmic central bankingalgorithmic stablecoins bring forth a new asset class that is both automationdriven and mathematically precise utilizing a partfractional partalgorithmic composition frax stablecoins are the first blend between collateralized and algorithmic stablecoins – assimilating all benefits of both types this new and developing class of stablecoin directly drives innovation towards the pioneering of algorithmic central bankingthe concept of algorithmic central banking is a fairly new and evolving concept but with endless potential it aims to revolutionize modern monetary policy as a mathematical automated and stable programmatical system that is price aware of itself algorithmic central banking stabilizes price without human input if the price rises supply is automated to increase and balance out until reattaining the stable level of  the same applies again in reversein comparison to fei protocol – an incentive stablecoin that aims to maintain a liquid market in which ethfei trades closely to the ethusd price – frax functions quite differentlywhere frax stabilizes price through its fractionalalgorithmic protocol fei employs direct incentives di which can actually cause fei price to lack any stability the di of fei can often punish sellers and reward buyers during times of volatilityfor example buying fei in early april  would lead to buyers receiving more than  fei per  on the other hand sellers at that same time would be losing out by selling fei below  in value this instability effectively prevented fei from functioning as a stablecoin fei has failed to maintain its  peg and protocol governance token tribe has dropped by around  since launchfrax’s algorithmic stablecoin features automation that fractionally returns the frax price to  – ultimately ensuring the  value is maintained regardless of market actionswings frax has maintained the peg since its inception in december a new dawn for stablecoinsthe frax protocol addresses the many risks associated with stablecoins while building upon their benefits by deploying the use of amos frax stablecoins alongside the fxs governance token ensure trustless stability that is both a completely decentralized and highly scalable onchain solution to market instability when compared to the likes of tether or dai the risk of overcollateralization and rapid market fluctuations impacting frax are nonexistentdeveloping upon the schematic of purely algorithmic stablecoins such as fei frax and fxs stand as two pillars upon the foundation of algorithmic central banking with each development stability continues to improve in a market as volatile as crypto the recent curve amo for instance puts frax and usdc collateral to work providing liquidity for the protocol and tightening the pegrecent introductions of the float protocol – which fluctuates similarly to fiat currencies – and the rai reflex index – which algorithmically maintains its own stability – continue to show the ongoing evolution of the stablecoin marketas this market adapts to economical needs and obstacles the mainstream adoption of crypto and stablecoins increases among the latest in crypto innovation frax is pioneering a new approach to stablecoin mechanisms and as such
