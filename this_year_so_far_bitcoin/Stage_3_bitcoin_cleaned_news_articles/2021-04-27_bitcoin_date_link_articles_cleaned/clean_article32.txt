first nfts then bitcoins comes the recent news about kansas city chiefs tight end sean culkin planning to become the first nfl player to take  percent of his salary in bitcoins rather than benjamins assuming he makes the team of course because he’s signed to a reserve future contract so the bitcoins don’t rain until he makes the chiefs’ roster so how much is a single bitcoin worth the market value of a single bitcoin is currently worth  as of the end of business on april  still that’s  cnotes  bennys for the mathematically challenged no matter how you slice it dice it or try to comprehend why an nfl player would do so that’s a lot of coins err bitcoinsculkin wrote on twitter that he “wanted to prove he’s got skin in the game” props to you objective achievedyou got  virtual bitskins coming to you in the future maybe you will truly have a brinks truck back up and drop off  bags of physical coins of bitgold mined by licensed cryptominers of course to your home maybe even by a gigantic armored drone that would be coolyou can’t say culkin’s not putting his bitcoins where his mouth isi don’t claim to be much of an expert on this subject actually this tweet kinda sums up how i feel about the whole crypto thing crypto is crossfit but nevertheless i am intrigued by this move on the part of an nfl playerhere come the bitcoinsand wondering what it all means it’s much more than just a symbolic gesture and it’s more than carolina panthers’ ot russell okung’s earlier move to take half of his salary in bitcoins the other half in benjaminsokung was just dipping his toe in the shallow end of the pool he’s only halfway in culkin’s all in culkin does a cannonball off the highdive into the deep end of the pool he’s wanting all his duckets delivered in this newfangled mode not just a slice of the duckets’ piei know this much about bitcoin accounts – they cannot be frozen or examined by tax inspectors and banks are unnecessary for bitcoins law enforcement and bankers see bitcoins as similar to the gold nuggets of the wild west — beyond their control outside their purviewand i imagine that probably pisses them off and i’m ok with that kinda like it actually“bartender i’d like a whiskey and here’s some virtual gold dust to settle up with the house for my tab”i kinda like the image of la harkening back to its wild west frontier mentality roots in the futurea new negotiation tool for the nflbut since la is a land of early adopters of new ideas and emerging global technologies maybe there will come a time when an la rams player will make a similar requestthe conversation the negotiation might even go down a little like this “ya know   les   i’d like to help you out with restructuring my contract in consideration of how you’re up against the salary cap and all but    you’re gonna have to kick down a few bitcoins to make me seriously consider your proposal”in fact there’s probably an agent out there right now who’s about to become the first players’ agent specializing in writing crypto contracts for nfl players and his office will be in – where else los angeles maybe even wilshire boulevard in a highrise fresh flowers in the lobby a blonde receptionist and the agent will have professionally messy haira flaw in the systemof course there is no nfl team paying players in bitcoins yet do you know the okung story he was paid in us dollars and converted his money into bitcoinbecause this bitcoin crypto stuff is global and ‘cuz la does bidness globally and the nfl wants to become a global game and the nba is already two steps ahead of the league in that departmentnba says “we see your games in london and raise you one”but less we forget our manners if russell okung was able to convert half of his salary  million to bitcoin as he stated on december   he would have purchased  bitcoin then at a market price of today that  million payment in bitcoin is worth  that’s a hefty rate of returnyep in some form or fashion and in the notsodistant future an la rams player maybe someone not even on the roster now but some asyetunknown future ram will want bitcoin    and when that time arrives the rams will most certainly be up against the leagueimposed bitcoincap 🙂
