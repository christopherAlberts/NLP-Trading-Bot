respectivelyyet on a combined basis these major indexes dont even come close to matching the  return of cryptocurrency giant bitcoin cryptobtc over the same time frameignoring the bitcoin hype would be a smart movemany of the same theses that bulls have extolled for years continue to drive bitcoins ascent for example fans still view its  million token limit as a hedge against the longterm devaluation of the us dollar as the money supply increasesenthusiasts also still value bitcoin for its payment potential a greater number of businesses are accepting cryptocurrency now than ever before and bitcoins network can settle payment transactions in an average of  minutes this compares to crossborder payments on traditional networks which can take up to a week to be validated and settledthe worlds most popular digital currency has also received a boost from brandname enterprise adoption electricvehicle maker tesla recently announced a  billion purchase of bitcoin which will be added to the automakers balance sheetbut you might be disappointed if you dig beyond the shortterm cheerleading and technical analysis history is clear that when nextbigthing investments go parabolic

think a democratled congress will legalize marijuana at the federal level thats far from a given considering how little our countrys two political parties agree on its also worth noting that president joe biden has only pledged to decriminalize and reschedule cannabis thankfully legalization isnt necessary for a handful of multistate operators to shine and cresco is part of that groupfollowing the completion of the verdant creations acquisition which added four dispensaries in ohio the company has two dozen operating retail locations cresco has been particular in targeting limited license
