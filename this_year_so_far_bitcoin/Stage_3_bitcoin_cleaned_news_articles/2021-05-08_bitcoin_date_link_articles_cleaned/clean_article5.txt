it is safe to say that almost no one understands what bitcoin is most think that it’s the latest in a long line of get rich schemes first used in  bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that has grown in popularity to the tune of about  million unique users by  as the cryptocurrency is not currently regulated by any national government it is suspected as the  century answer to money laundering but on the whole it is used by most users as a risky but profitable investmentto this point this sounds like it could be the next generation of money government issued currencies are having a hard time keeping up with counterfeiters seriously how do they recreate all of the  watermarks metallic seals and plastic windows etc cryptocurrencies solve that by eliminating the physical coin or bill but how does bitcoin workthe simple answer is that it takes a lot of energy to run the rooms of computer servers needed to make this work the size of the servers is almost like walking into a computer center of the  the university of cambridge in england has a bitcoin electricity consumption index that estimates that the worldwide energy use for bitcoin mining went from  terawatt hours twh at the beginning of  to  twh at the beginning of  just as for comparison the entire new york power authority nypa network generates about  twh of electricity per yearsome of that nypa generated electricity is currently going to a cryptocurrency mining operation near the st lawrencefdr power project in massena more concerning from a climate perspective is a new center that combined bitcoin mining with a reopened power plant in dresden on the western shore of seneca lake unlike the use of the clean hydropower in massena the greenidge generation llc center be using a plant converted from coal to natural gas with all of the power now being used by the bitcoin operation according to a grist investigative report this center has already become one of the largest in the country and is currently using enough electricity to power  homes – with plans to expandthe conversion of the dresden power plant was approved well before the climate leadership and community protection act clcpa was passed last year the clcpa put into legislative mandate the climate pledges previously made by the state one of these was a target of  zero emission electricity by  and an  reduction in greenhouse gas ghg emissions by  these targets however are calculated for energy sources that are added to the electric grid as a “behind the meter” source of power the dresden plant is not legally required to reduce their ghg emissions in fact as their operations expanded the nys department of environmental conservation nys dec noted that their ghg emissions increased  from  to this could be a nightmare for the new york state climate targets as upstate currently has  mothballed coal and methane power plants which could be used for similar purposesthis could be a nightmare for the new york state climate targets as upstate currently has  mothballed coal and methane power plants which could be used for similar purposes we’ve already had two local possibilities in  beowulf energy proposed to convert the somerset power plant into a largescale data center with about a quarter of the plant designated for bitcoin mining in april of this year a methane fired power plant in north tonawanda was purchased by cryptocurrency mining company digihostlike any business bitcoin miners are looking for the least expensive way to do business most of their costs are the electricity that they use if they purchase a power plant likely at fire sale pricing they have no incentive to meet clcpa targets and purchase renewable energy since they will be able to use their fossil fuel plant for their lowcost energy needs most of the mothballed plants were underutilized when the baselines for the clcpa targets were calculated if even a handful of plants go back to methane fired operations we can likely kiss new york’s climate change targets goodbyeearlier this year the chinese regional government in inner mongolia announced a ban on all bitcoin miningearlier this year the chinese regional government in inner mongolia announced a ban on all bitcoin mining new york needs a pause to assess the effects of bitcoin mining and help may be on the way on may  ny senate bill  was proposed by sen kevin parker which would stop bitcoin mining for three years in order to assess the environmental impact of the industry we haven’t had an issue with such potential climate impact since the issue of hydrofracking over  years ago as we are near the end of the legislative session i would suggest to governor cuomo to use the same playbook as governor patterson did back in  have the nys dec issue an administrative pause to study what environmental impacts the bitcoin mining will have and how it will impact the goals of the clcpalead image photo by executium
