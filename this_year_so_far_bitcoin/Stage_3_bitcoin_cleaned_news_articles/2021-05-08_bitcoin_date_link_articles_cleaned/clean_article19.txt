when the famous satoshi nakamoto first designed his masterpiece few could possibly have imagined the almost  peak that sent investors into a frenzy even these days the firstever cryptocurrency’s price feels hard to believe at times and investors might be pinching themselves every now and then taking a seat alongside bitcoin btc on the roller coaster altcoins like litecoin ltc ether eth and bitcoin cash bch joined the ride — and more recently defi giants polkadot and cardanobut for the long haul looking into the crystal ball it’s difficult to see the future of a coin shrouded in uncertainty ray dalio raised fair points in his critique of bitcoin arguing that uncertainties regarding how governments will react to digital assets supplanting fiat currency in utilization are causes for potential concern down the road he further argued that the bitcoin blockchain will soon be outdated and without any central governance to adapt it to emerging blockchain technology a superior coin could overtake itrelated defi won’t last long without unlocking bitcoin’s  treasure chestand that nails home the point bitcoin’s underlying blockchain protocols are very limiting in terms of enabling broader financial applications it would be unfathomable to operate a massive defi ecosystem on top of the bitcoin blockchain given bitcoin’s proofofwork transaction consensus algorithmdespite its limitations it’s difficult to predict whether innovative advances in competing coins’ blockchains will be enough to overtake bitcoin’s success it all hinges on the utility factor will crypto stay a store of value or will it become a viable alternative for exchanging valuerelated did bitcoin prove itself to be a reliable store of value in  experts answeremerging blockchain technologies and defi’s successsince the dawn of bitcoin just over a decade ago the blockchain industry has given rise to hundreds of different projects with each one aiming to forge a new coin into stardom many succeeded in the long term ether the second closest coin in value to bitcoin continued hitting new alltime highs throughout april validating not just the coin’s potential as a store of value asset but also ethereum’s potential as a blockchain networkrelated where does the future of defi belong ethereum or bitcoin experts answersimilar to ethereum a number of projects aimed to emulate the titan that vitalik buterin and his associates built such as cardano eos and most recently the hot and popular polkadot each project tries to build off the limitations of the other to varying degrees of success hype has been the majority of what’s been delivered to users as only time will reveal the true validity of these projectsregardless of the blockchain projects and their creative names they’ve spurred on an ecosystem of collaborative development together they’ve created decentralized apps or dapps that can bring the unbanked out of the doldrums of impoverishment opportunity to the financially excluded and new investment avenues to the alreadysavvyrelated it’s time to put the dukes down and work together for blockchain’s futurethe flourishing of coins and dapps serves up plenty of optimism to many outsiders looking in offering hope that there is real potential to foster a booming decentralized finance ecosystem — or at least a hybrid of it combined with centralized markets but it’s all thanks to belief in bitcoin’s value which is the fixation point of many investorsrelated was  a ’defi year’ and what is expected from the sector in  experts answerbitcoin’s store of value is what’s really on the mindwhat drove the inquisitiveness of investors developers and crypto enthusiasts alike was the appeal of bitcoin as a store of value against fiat currencies bitcoin is deflationary so during periods like the  pandemic bitcoin’s appeal turned whitehotrelated how has the  pandemic affected the crypto space experts answerwhile discussions about ethereum polkadot and other blockchain platforms caught the attention of the defi world many outsiders remained numb to them and fixated on the coin prices and that’s why bitcoin’s appeal stays as a store of value for the most partrelated the butterfly effect why defi will force btc to break its  supply ceilingmany ordinary retail investors and institutional investors don’t have a firm grasp on crypto’s inner workings according to a cardify survey only  of crypto investors “fully understand” it while just over  of them have limited or “zero knowledge” over  of crypto investors are newbies who are riding the hype wave it’s arguable that the entry barriers to the defi world are quite high and literacy is rather hard to attain but that’s a story for another timerelated institutional investors won’t take bitcoin mainstream — you willmoreover institutional investors remain wary of the volatility issues facing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with ongoing predictions of an imminent bubble — another signal that underlying blockchain technologies are less of a priority and this is precisely why other coins will not overtake bitcoin so long as the mainstream fixation remains pinned to coin value and not underlying blockchain value bitcoin will stand atop the cryptocurrency podium whether investors can become more literate in the inner workings of the defi world will determine how much value investors will find in the underlying technologies of new and emerging coinsfor now bitcoin is the king of the hill and will likely stay that way for a long time as the price continues to climb and mainstream
