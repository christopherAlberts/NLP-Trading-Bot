there are various reasons why you should withdraw your bitcoin and utilize selfcustodya bitcoin etf is coming whether you like it or notyou might be excited at the stamp of approval this gives bitcoin from the old guard it will also allow many investors to much more easily gain exposure to bitcoin through current accounts at big banks these are huge positives for a new commodity that’s rapidly gaining recognition as a revolutionary instrument for storing value over timehowever as with many financial products on wall street the people of main street should tread with caution big banks are not known for having the interests of the average joe in mindthe biggest hidden danger of a bitcoin etf though goes deeper than the big banks it goes all the way to the most powerful governments and the source of the world’s current reserve currencywe all need to ask ourselves before we buy any bitcoin etf at the end of each day who actually holds your bitcointhis question may seem innocent today but history tells us it could be very important in the near futurewhere are your assets heldfor all the evolution in “fintech” over the last decade to make investing easier — from roboadvisors to gamified trading apps — the underlying structure has not changedwhy mostly because regulation stipulates who can hold what assets and how that ownership is proven and governed leading to a lack of innovation in old paperbased processes the banking industry does not have much incentive to upgrade the back end of their systems most of the supposed innovation in fintech just hides the old world behind a digital veneerthe assets you buy and check in your brokerage apps — stocks bonds etfs — are held by regulated custodians for you most of the time this is not a problem it’s actually more convenient for you can you imagine if you had to bring a stock certificate to a bank branch every time you wanted to sell a share using regulated custodians in the back with a digital interface on top makes trading much more convenient for everyone but it does mean someone else holds your assets we’ll get back to why that’s so important laterbitcoin as a digitally native asset is a bit different most places where you can buy bitcoin also allow you to withdraw that bitcoin to your own wallet since everything is digital the whole process of buying and withdrawing to your wallet can take mere seconds bitcoin on an exchange is a bit like cash in the bank except without the physical part where you have to go to the atm or branch to withdraw the cash then cut a hole in your mattress to tuck it away whenever we withdraw bitcoin or any asset from the exchange or custodian that holds it for us we call that taking “selfcustody”bitcoin’s purely digital nature makes it vastly easier to selfcustody bitcoin than it is to selfcustody dollar bills or stocks holding bitcoin yourself takes a few taps on your phone not a trip to the bank or a gargantuan fight to change the regulated custodial model of most investment assetsso most investment assets are held by a custodian but in many cases it’s very easy to selfcustody bitcoin so why would you want to hold bitcoin or any other asset yourselfwhy does it matter who holds my assetsin a first world country where institutions work well it’s hard to see why this question matters if you live in one of these countries you’ve probably never had a problem selling an asset or withdrawing cash from a bankhowever if you work in an industry that’s “on the margin” of acceptability for banks and the governments that govern them — think adult entertainment or gambling — you may be familiar with the hassle and anguish of frozen bank accounts or seized funds if you live outside the first world bubble you may know the importance of selfcustody through experience bank failures government seizures or corrupt institutions causing your assets to vanishunfortunately there’s a much deeper danger at play here one that affects everyone equally especially those in first world countries carrying heavy debts in both the public and private sectorsto understand that danger we need to walk through how it played out in the past in the richest country on earthwhen governments steal the savings of citizensin the early  the us government was in deep trouble the great depression drove the government to print money but their ability to flood the market with cash and prop up prices was reaching its limit at that time every dollar in circulation federal reserve note needed to be backed by at least  cents worth of gold at the fed the fed had maxed out the dollars they could print against the gold they had so they needed more gold to print more dollarshowever the fed’s money printing created another problem by debasing the value of cash they destroyed existing savings and made holding cash a bad way to save up for the future american citizens struggling to make it through the great depression now faced a threat to the value of their savings and wages they needed an asset that could not be debased back then all they had was goldboth the american government and american citizens chased after gold what happened nextthe american government seized the gold of its citizenspresident roosevelt signed executive order  on april   using wartime powers still in effect to order all persons to deliver their gold coins and bullion to the federal reserve on or before may  of the same year and to bar any further purchasing of gold by private citizensof course the federal reserve would give everyone dollars in return for their gold at the current market rate of  per ounce of gold feels fair right well less than a year later the dollar was revalued at  per ounce of gold through the gold reserve act of  devaluing those dollars by almost  against the gold everyone traded inthe federal reserve was thus able to continue devaluing the dollar but private citizens were barred from holding the very asset that could protect their savings from that devaluationthose americans who held gold coins under the floorboards of their house had some chance of protecting them from seizure gold kept in banks however was far easier for the government to seize — the authorities knew exactly where to go to get itwho had custody of your gold mattered a lot during this periodstill this was a very strained and extreme time in american and world history what indications if any do we have that this little bit of history might repeat how might bitcoin be involveddo governments have any reason to want to seize bitcoin todayfirst it’s important to understand that bitcoin was designed purposefully to combat the inflationary tendencies of governments and central banks when economic downturns occur governments are always tempted to print more cash saying they are “satisfying demand for cash” in reality they are debasing the value of cash for all who hold it and reallocating value to whoever the government pays with that newly printed cashfrom satoshi nakamoto’s thread unveiling the bitcoin white paperthe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust thats required to make it work the central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust more typical of a precious metal instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same the supply is predetermined and the value changesthis is why bitcoin has come to be known as “digital gold” it provides the same protections for savers that gold provided in past inflationary periods with vastly improved accessibility and portability this is due to bitcoin’s supply not responding whatsoever to changes in demand precious metals are the only other assets on earth with a total supply that acts similarly though not as predictably as bitcoinwhen governments decide to spin up the printing presses for their fiat currencies storeofvalue assets like bitcoin and gold serve as exits from fiat debasementthe conditions for seizurefor governments to have any reason to seize bitcoin — or any other storeofvalue asset — there would need to be a major crisis at the end of a long accumulation of debts like in the  governments would need to respond to the crisis by devaluing their currencies through money printing — just like in the this would punish those who hold or receive salaries in fiat currencies by debasing their savings and earnings in turn people everyone would run for the exit selling their sinking fiat currency for other assets that cannot be debasedgovernments can either watch their currency — and the power that comes with it — evaporate faster and faster as a result of their own debasement and the selling it caused or they can use the power they have left to do what roosevelt did in  they can seize storeofvalue assets and stop further purchases by force essentially blocking the exit and keeping individuals from protecting their savingsdo the conditions for seizure exist todaydo we have a major crisis on our hands at a time of record debt levels causing unprecedented money printing are we seeing rising prices for storeofvalue assetsmajor crisis check thanks covidrecord debt levels checkunprecedented money printing checkrising prices for assets checkduring a year when most of the world was in a recession stock prices grew in value tremendously this is a classic marker of “running for the exit” — anyone with cash is looking to buy anything else that’s a better store of value than cash from january   to the time of writing the sp  is up almost  and bitcoin is up almost  even lumber is up still not convinced ray dalio studies markets and economic cycles for a living — and he’s damn good at it as the founder and ceo of the world’s largest hedge fund in a recent piece covering the current financial climate dalio compares today to the – period stating“if history and logic are to be a guide policy makers who are short of money will raise taxes and won’t like these capital movements out of debt assets and into other storeofwealth assets and other tax domains so they could very well impose prohibitions against capital movements to other assets eg gold bitcoin etc and other locations these tax changes could be more shocking than expected”in times of crisis who has custody of your assets matters most will you leave your bitcoin on an exchange or with a custodian or will you hold it yourselfwithdraw your bitcoinwe are living in unprecedented times in a situation that the vast majority of us have never experienced before in our lives history and logic point to a repeat of events at the end of the last major debt cycle where governments seized assets from citizens to solve a problem they created and save a system they benefit fromthis time the people have a far more powerful tool to escape this seizure however that tool needs to be used correctly owning bitcoin but failing to hold it yourself is like buying a helmet but refusing to wear it when you ride it’s not there to protect you when you need it moststoring your bitcoin on an exchange or owning it through an etf product exposes your coins to seizure in the very scenario where bitcoin is most valuable and necessary an unwinding of the current monetary systemthankfully it’s still simple today to purchase and securely store your bitcoin
