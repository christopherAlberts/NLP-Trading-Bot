on may  the publicly traded mining firm marathon created its first “sanctionscompliant” block of bitcoin transactions after announcing its intention to do just thatthe development renewed the fear that bitcoin’s longtouted censorship resistance — that is how miners typically take an agnostic viewpoint to which transactions are included in their blocks — would slip due to the actions of network participants like marathon’s new poolbut understanding this controversy means understanding the growing intersection between bitcoin an open transaction network and the us office of foreign asset control which administers the united states government’s financial sanctions effortsofac and bitcointhe usbased marathon announced plans in late march to launch a btc mining pool in compliance with ofacin recent years ofac has become more and more assertive by adding crypto wallet addresses to its specially designated nationals list as cyberattacks become more central to national security moreover countries subject to wholesale embargo regimes like north korea iran and venezuela have flocked to crypto heightening us suspiciona longstanding grievance has been uncertainty about miners themselves with bitcoin’s mining network famously chinaheavy for most of its existence many in us national security and intelligence have presumed that block rewards are going to unsavory partiesamong a number of entities working to bring mining into the us marathon is especially active in trying to play ball with authorities but what does ofaccompliant mining look likemara pool’s methods in practicethe initial announcement was unclear exactly how mara pool would determine which transactions it would classify as “clean”a representative for marathon told the block when reached“mara ofac pool uses dmg’s walletscore one of the original chain analytics technologies to determine which transactions will be accepted into a blockbased on information provided by the us department of the treasury and office of foreign assets control databases of ofac restricted cryptocurrency addresses as well as other sources including the dark web”in other words dmg walletscore does not just identify wallet addresses named in ofac’s lists — of which there are not even  the software assesses wallet addresses for past transactions to assign risk scoresput another way this approach represents a classic form of risk appraisal one that’s familiar to traditional banking institutions looking to filter potential clients and more recently a type of program that compliant crypto exchanges have had to implementyet for a mining operation that becomes an issue of checking wallets at velocity it seems to have severely restricted the block that marathon mined both in terms of transactions and monetary reward for the minersblock number  earned mara ofac pool  it included only  transactions for comparison the two adjacent blocks earned  and  in miner rewards and processed  and  transactions respectivelycontroversybeyond simple issues of throughput extending these types of wallet checks has been extremely contentious among the crypto industry many identify measures like mara pool as threats to bitcoin’s promise of censorshipresistant selfsovereign transactionsas a result the crypto industry was quick to dogpile on mara pool and its newly minted block some users noted that despite the overabundance of caution two of the transactions processed belonged to addresses previously associated with darknet market hydradeveloper giacomo zucco noted that there had always been a problem that “miners can choose to generate empty ie coinbaseonly blocks preventing people from transacting onchain” but that these blocks would require outside subsidization the ultimate question he said was “will the marketdemand for uncensored txs be sometimes higher than the budget for censorship”trading for marathon on nasdaq has slipped from  on april  to  today the firm has seen its market value balloon over the past year and expects to have a new order of  bitmain asics operational by the beginning of next year
