nakamotos idea vs the real world how bitcoin is more mainstream than you thinkmillions of people still wonder can bitcoin and mainstream finance fiat money ever get alongi will answer this question in many spheres but first i will start from a historical point of viewcan bitcoin fit into mainstream financelooking at the evidence cryptocurrency is moving closer towards mainstream than ever before several high techs like tesla et al have started showing huge interest investing huge amounts in bitcoin and other coinshistorically the government doesnt go along with anything thats beyond its controlwithout government and financial institutions the world would have been in chaos the government controls mainstream finance hence these questions can be placed ascan government and bitcoin ever fit the answer is a resounding no there is a reason for this blunt answer bitcoin can be adopted fully by the mainstream but i doubt if it will ever fit in a lot will have to be changed for it to fit by fitting in i mean if it can ever maintain its essence independence and nakamotos real ideawhy the skepticismsince the beginning of time the purpose of every government around the world has always been to lead control and manage the affairs of the people and money is always the greater part of thisbitcoin is way too decentralized it is very unreachable and this makes it a problem for mainstream finance a coin that controls itself rules itself and determines its own fate doesnt sit well with any government in fact for them its a risk from all angles because the government doesnt accept what it cant controlblockchain has been able to act as the incorruptible bank in bitcoin trading so everyone is starting to understand that money may not always need a bankthe concept of bitcoin may look like it might fit mainstream finance for now but this is all because the buzz for bitcoin has become overwhelmingly too much hence they dont want to be seen as outdated and antipeople the mainstream might look like it has adopted it but if any problem arises it will capitalize on it and use it to downplay the concept of bitcoinnow and always mainstream finance will always see blockchain as a threat rather than a componentbut this doesnt matter the rivalry is what helps coins to develop and also ensures a better outcome for millions of users around the worldnakamotos idea vs real worldbitcoin is a worthy challenger there is a reason for it being viewed as a rivalevery currency that can stand the test of time must possess six qualities these qualities are scarcity divisibility utility transportability durability and counterfeit abilitycurrency has value because it can be used as a store and then can be used as a unit of exchange both locally and internationallythe crypto bitcoin has value it upholds very well when it comes to the  qualities of a currencythe biggest issue is that its status as a unit of exchange is still contested because most businesses are yet to see it as a mode of paymentthe utility and transferability are still contested because cryptocurrency still has a lot to deal with when it comes to storage and exchange spacesif bitcoin keeps the pace gains scale ground and captures  of the worlds currency market then things will change drasticallythe government uses the printing of money as a means to control scarcity bitcoin doesnt have such a scheme rather it has flexible issuances rate which changes over timeall currencies or thing of value is backed with a physical thing like a physical commodity gold precious stones and the value is driven by things like the scale of value and demandbitcoin lacks such and the value of bitcoin is primarily driven by speculative interest the bitcoin bubble happens as a result of price runups and media craze attention if all mainstream adopts it the media craze will drop and the price runups will be unlikely to happen but no one can tellthe exchange spaces and storage of cryptocurrency have been plagued by hacks thefts and fraud although a lot is protecting the system it may face bigger security issueswhy the real world may pose the biggest challenge and how governments influence will bitebased on the financial system bitcoin and other digital currencies will be in stasis if the government keeps antagonizing themif it passes this risk of stasis another problem is the rivalry major institutions like facebook amazon google apple and all are rumored to be looking at publishing their currenciesthe bitcoin is good but so far it has as many flaws as the fiat currencies of today if not more bitcoin is good but empires might strike back states like china and russia are already warming up to launch their coins and the statebacked coins will unarguably lead the charge because the constricts limiting the bitcoins will be lifted by these statesthe future of fiat and crypto fitness lies in corporate and sovereign coins most likely cohabitation will be likely uneasy and unpredictablethe fear is that these coins that will be backed by states wont be like bitcoin rather the will be like paypal and wechat pay they may likely not have blockchains but the blockchains may be a placebo blockchain these states will always like to be in control of the fate of the cointhe scheme of money being universally peoplepowered will be destroyed by state innovated coins because the sole major purpose of bitcoin decentralization will be destroyedthe new bitcoins will be out and great but will be wrapped in brands and layers of corporate brands state flags and brands from powerful firmsthe decentralization and bitcoin liberation may then rest in perfect peace because the blockchain system has been the wall blocking the government from controlling itsince the idea of state coins has seen the limelight everything may burn out slowly as the government i repeat doesnt accept what it cant controldemocratic governments like us canada and others might give some leverage but communist governments will never allow such big power to leave their handsdemocratic norms and stand has been tested over the past few years very democratic governments are slowly turning into pseudodemocracy and this affects all aspects of life money most especiallybitcoin has had remarkable  years and has proven that certain aspects of life dont need interference such a notion is unbelievable to governments and methods must be used to keep it in linethe concept of bitcoin may be adopted by mainstream finance but a lot will be lost it may be an adulterated coin bitcoin may lose its value if more coins keep sprouting out from all cornersgavin brown and richard whittle of the manchester metropolitan university said  could well be the year the cryptocurrency dream dies this is not to say that cryptocurrency will die altogether far from ithow the concept of bitcoin can fit mainstream financethe concept of bitcoin can fit mainstream finance but not in a way that would benefit the common massesbitcoin or digital currency may be adopted into mainstream finance but the real idea of bitcoin can never fit into mainstream finance because a lot of water would have passed under the bridge and its major concept of decentralization would be lost if that happens then fitting into the mainstream will be beautiful nonsensethe demand for digital currency has more than tripled since the pandemic the government and mainstream finance will answer to this demand but asking if bitcoin will fit into the mainstream as we know it is likely not going to happen so easilynakamotos idea is to make everyone transact without any form of human control such an idea is largely hard to absorb in the real world of finance especially when control is the main bargaining powertags
