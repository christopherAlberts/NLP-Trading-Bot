the bitcoin options market is on track to record a modest monthly options expiry in the wake of the recent price crash – mainly because the cryptocurrency’s price is so much lower but there’s still speculation some traders might try to use the moment to push prices as high as  to increase their payoff or minimize any payoutsthe may expiry expected early friday would have been much bigger had it not been for bitcoin’s recent drop from  to  which pricked the speculative bubble in the marketmajor exchanges are due to settle  contracts worth  billion on friday based on data from the provider skew that makes the upcoming may expiry the smallest of  in terms of nominal valuesubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policyalmost all the options contracts will expire at  coordinated universal time  am et – the designated time on deribit which is the dominant exchange for cryptocurrency optionsopen interest across all expiries – the total value of outstanding positions – nearly halved to  billion in the two weeks to may  and was last seen at just over  billionsettlement of monthly option contracts has gained relevance this year with the “max pain point” – the strike price at which the most open options contracts expire worthless – serving as an overhang in the runup to expiration last friday of the monthfor example bitcoin fell from nearly  to  in the six days leading up to the march  expiry narrowing the gap between spot prices and the thenmax pain point of  and the cryptocurrency bounced by  to  reaching the max pain point ahead of the april expirythe idea is that the max pain point acts as a magnet for spot prices while heading into expiration that’s because option sellers mostly institutions sometimes try to push prices closer to the max pain point to inflict maximum loss on options buyersbitcoin open interest as per expiration source skewthe max pain point for friday’s expiry is  – more than  above the current price of  some investors are betting that the max pain effect will kick in ahead of the settlement pushing prices toward  as tweeted by swissbased options analytics platform laevitaswhile historical data supports the case for a preexpiry rally the size of the impending settlement is relatively small compared to previous expirations for example a record  billion worth of contracts expired at the end of march while exchanges settled more than  billion of options earlier on april thus the max pain effect may not have big influence on the market ahead of friday’s settlement however other factors such as the renewed outflows from crypto exchanges may help the battered cryptocurrency gain some groundwhile nominal value has declined with the price drop the number of contacts open on deribit has remained mostly stable in the aftermath of the price crashthe resilience could be attributed to increased option selling in the wake of the recent spike in implied volatility some asiabased family offices and ultrahighnetworth individuals sold put options earlier this weekalso read bitcoin outflow from exchanges suggests confidence crypto rout is over
