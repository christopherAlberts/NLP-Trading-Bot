i’m not saying that cryptocurrencies will fail in fact it is quite obvious that the future of currencies is digital and crypto is simply a particular way of operating a digital currencyi’m saying that bitcoin will fail i have seen articles that use bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as synonyms but that’s a mistake there are thousands of cryptocurrencies and bitcoin is just one of them it is the earliest one so it is the most wellknown but i believe there are serious problems with bitcoin that will cause it to fail here are the top reasonsthere is no real valuesome people say that fiat money which are the normal currencies that we all use today also does not have real value since we moved out of the gold standard this is incorrect fiat money has the value of the guarantee of the government that issues it in fact on the indian rupee note you will see a “promise to pay the bearer issued by the rbi governor in the us dollar you will see the words “legal tender which means the same thing governments have the power to tax their people and businesses the ability to sell public assets issue bonds and other ways to guarantee their currencies these are formidable powers that give the confidence that the value of the currency will be therestocks have real value because of the companies’ ability to create profits from the goods and services that they sell commodities have real value because industries purchase them as raw materials to use in the production of goods and servicesthe only value that bitcoin has is in somebody else willing to pay a price for it in that sense it is like a piece of artwork but even a piece of artwork has the ability to beautify the space that it occupies bitcoin doesn’t even have thatthere is no stabilizing forcefiat money is heavily defended by the government issuing it central banks go into the international monetary markets to perform “market operations which is to buy or sell their national currencies in order to keep them stable without stability a currency does not workbitcoin’s volatility makes it a terrible currency it doesn’t matter how many vendors profess to accept it just think of it this way if you have bitcoin will you use it to purchase anything you won’t you would just use fiat money that is because you didn’t buy bitcoin to use as a currency you bought it as a speculative investment hoping that it would go up in value you wouldn’t pay in bitcoin because your fear is that two weeks later bitcoin’s value goes up by  for the same reason when bitcoin starts to slide vendors will stop accepting it as payment because they don’t want the value to go down by  a week afterit is in competition with national currenciessupporters of bitcoin say that it will replace fiat money if this has the remotest possibility of becoming true it means that bitcoin is in competition with national currencies can we really imagine the central banks of china the us and the eu saying “let’s cancel our currencies and just use bitcoin which no one can control this would be fatal to their monetary systems as we have seen in recent days china has banned bitcoin trading and mining various other countries have also hinted that they would be following suit so no countries will not adopt bitcoin they will issue their own versions instead and then ban bitcoininvesting in bitcoin is not investing in blockchain techthere are cryptocurrencies known as stablecoins which are backed up by real assets such as the us dollar that use the very latest in blockchain technology these coins are much more suitable to be used as currencies because they only fluctuate as much or as little as their underlying assets so again no nobody is buying bitcoin because of its blockchain tech because there are better options availablebitcoin is a utopian dreamwhy are prominent people buying bitcoin if it has so many problems some bitcoin supporters have the vision of a future where currencies are fully democratized and not controlled by governments i am not confident that this future will come based on the reasons abovethe massive amount of liquidity in the markets right now from the monetary and fiscal policies of many governments to combat covid is an important reason for the rise in the value in bitcoin this is not sustainable over the long termwhatever other advantages that bitcoin might have over fiat money such as speed of transactions will be eroded when fiat money becomes fully digitalmoh hon meng is cofounder ifast groupsubscribe to mint newsletters  enter a valid email  thank you for subscribing to our newsletternever miss a story stay connected and informed with mint download our app nowtopics
