jeffrey halley oandas senior market analyst for asia pacific joins yahoo finance live to discuss the outlook for cryptocurrency a potential bitcoin regulation and the future of digital paymentsvideo transcriptjulie hyman cryptocurrencies have calmed down to some extent at least by crypto standards i suppose we are still seeing some action in bitcoin right now its up about  earlier when we checked i believe it was lower so continuing with volatility both to the up and to the down side lets talk to somebody about crypto and where its going from herejeffrey halley is with us oanda senior market analyst of asiapacific and jeffrey as you look at the recent moves that we have seen in cryptocurrencies i know that you sort of have thoughts on what the longterm investable case is i want to leave that aside just for a second and talk about the recent price action and where you think bitcoin in particular is going to go from herejeffrey halley yeah i often say that bitcoin and the crypto space is a tradable asset and not but not necessarily an investable asset so it has extreme volatility and theres money to be made there theres money to be lost there as well and i wont dispute that one and i wish all those traders the very best i think it was very indicative that when it broke the  moving average and crashed down to  very quickly that there was very very little liquidityso it very much behaves like an emerging market when things get tough so the saying in emerging markets is an emerging market is a market you cant emerge from in an emergency and i think thats sort of indicative of the price action that were going to see now i think a lot of traders were taken out of positioning on that crash and were going to see even less liquidity going forward than we didi think equally quite a few of them tried to get back in again as it rallied up off  but it is struggling above  now and im just im not quite convinced just by looking at the technical picture that were not going to see another big move down were going to see liquidity gaps now because a lot of positioning has been taken out of the market so were going to see cryptos in general gapping between price points as liquidity disappearsstory continuesmyles udland well so and jeff in thinking about the role that emerging markets emerging assets tend to play when it comes to the performance of more established markets are you thinking that there wont be quite as much spillover perhaps as some folks have braced for as the size of the crypto market has grown in absolute dollars we still havent seen too too much of a weekend washout really dampening risk sentiment at least so far as weve seen here in us marketsjeffrey halley yeah its a very good point because until we saw that crash it seems like a lifetime ago but i think it was the beginning of last week and so we saw that i didnt really feel there was a lot of crossasset spillover but actually when the bitcoin crashed along with the other cryptos we did see a spillover we saw gold rise we saw some stocks coming under pressure we saw the dollar rise and i think investors a lot of these investors are going to have multiple assets in their portfoliosand it could well be the case that we saw in march last year where one position moves underwater it has to be sold and they have to liquidate other positionings and other asset classes to cover those losses and i believe that the crypto market actually did hit a  trillion market cap when bitcoin was at  a coin thats a lot of money to get wiped out and if its still around a trillion dollars now and it crashes by  well thats a big hit in the financial markets and i think this will actually also draw the attention of the regulators if we start seeing it spilling into other asset classes theyre going to start paying attention a lot morebrian sozzi jeffrey you talk i want to make sure i have this right so youre talking about liquidity potentially drying up regulators doing what they are known or likely to do regulate do you think theres another crash coming here this summerjeffrey halley i think theres a real risk now that i think i trace it back to this colonial pipeline saga and i think that might be cryptos flying too close to the sun they may have poked a sleeping bear just once too often and woken it up with regards to the regulators andor governments when you start launching attacks on united states infrastructure and were seeing it going on in some other parts of the world at the moment like new zealand as well when you start launching attacks on infrastructure and then taking the ransoms in bitcoin or other cryptos thats going to get the attention of some very serious and very powerful people at all levels of governmentand i believe that the china measures that weve seen are in part due to that and it wasnt so much about the actual power draw at all and i believe that the risk has ratcheted up exponentially now that blocs such as europe andor the united states actually start taking some measures to either regulate or partially ban cryptos as we know it so i think it does actually face an existential threat from that sector at the moment and that will of course be bearish for those coinsjulie hyman do you think though that theres a scenario where you have that kind of regular you know the crypto folks jeffrey will say we want regulation we welcome regulation right thats what they tend to say because they argue it will legitimize the cryptocurrencies in some measure do you see a scenario where cryptocurrencies can still rise in price and there is regulationjeffrey halley its a little hard to say because you talk to the original bitcoin creators and the original pioneers in the space the whole reason for cryptos to exist is to be outside of control to have this libertarian do what you want and move money and procure goods and services as you wish anywhere in the world its only when this institutional money has emerged into the space this year that weve started hearing that i struggle to see how they can actually coexist if governments and major countries around the world are going to regulate their use or even ban their usei do potentially see a future for digital coins like the digital yuan theyre talking of the feds talking about a digital us dollar now i can see those having a future but i cant see them coexisting with what weve seen going on in the space at the moment which seems to me driven more by speculative mania than underlying fundamentals at this stagejulie hyman jeffrey thanks so much jeffrey halley is oanda senior market analyst of asiapacific i dont know these days youre a little bit of a lone voice in the wilderness jeffrey so well see how it all pans out thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us
