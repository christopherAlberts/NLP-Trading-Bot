rewarding part about thisapart from the fact that anyone even watches the show the most rewarding part has been witnessing people taking steps to ensure their financial sovereignty that they never thought themselves to be technically capable of the amount of times ive had someone say theyve used a tutorial from the channel to leap into selfcustody spin up their own node or dive into the lightning network is truly inspiring i get to watch bitcoiners level up every dayquality content creation is not easy and building a loyal audience is a difficult task to complete can you dive into and share more about the hard work you put into creating contentill be honest its been a long slow process — especially when focusing solely on bitcoin and refusing to promote scammy pump and dump schemesi started the show back in  with the goal of making at least one video per week and ive never looked back the process has been fine tuned over time ill write out all the segments i need to cover film them jump into my editor and piece it all together make my thumbnail and show notes as the video renders pump the finished product out to youtube then share across twitter and other social platforms this  of course on top of actually learning how to use whatever im covering that daycomparatively the live stuff is quite a bit easier using newer streaming platforms i can basically become a host and switchboard operator as i pull in my intro browser video clips guests and anything else i like things have come a long waybitcoin is in a massive bull run how important is it to have

know why btc sessions is bullish on bitcoin dont hold anything backi am so bullish on bitcoiners through the past seven years ive seen the rise of principled individuals that wont give up an inch on the battlefield for this great equalizer — a permissionless global sound money bitcoiners are willing to go toetotoe with anyone regardless of how famous rich or powerful they are bitcoiners celebrate ideas not people in a world of nihilism and reliance on the elite for small handouts bitcoiners choose to take responsibility for their own actions and move forward building a better future with unbridled optimism if that doesnt make you bullish i dont know what willyoull be taking the stage in front of thousands of bitcoiners at bitcoin  in a few days what do you look forward to most about this gatheringbitcoiners are my people they are my family ive forged some very meaningful relationships with people across the world on this journey and at times it can be tough not getting that facetoface interaction for many of us in the space we dont have a lot of friends and family that share our passion and in some cases we may experience direct opposition to our views every day this has only been compounded by the mandated isolation of the last year and a half honestly for me this is a family reunion i cant wait to come homejoin the  party from anywhere in the world by joining our
