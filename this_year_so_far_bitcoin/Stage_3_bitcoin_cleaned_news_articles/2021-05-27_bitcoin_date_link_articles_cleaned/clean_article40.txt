in  bitmain a chinese company that makes specialized computers for mining cryptocurrency took an interest in the small town of rockdale texas within a shuttered aluminum plant the firm envisioned the world’s largest bitcoin mining operation bitmain planned to invest half a billion dollars in the venture promising  mining rigs consuming  megawatts of power and creating up to  new jobs for the central texas area but in the winter of that year bitcoin tumbled in price to just above  per share it had been  that fall after peaking around  late the prior year and the company was forced to lay off thousands of staff globally and dramatically scale back its rockdale operation it was a blow to the town of  which had lost a longshot bid to be the home for amazon’s  project and was desperate for business to save its languishing postindustrial economy amid a renewed bitcoin boom things are starting to look up again for lone star state cities like rockdaletexan weather might not seem conducive to stacking thousands of electricityhungry computers but in many ways texas provides an ideal landscape for cryptomining a deregulated and decentralized power market a lowregulation and lowtax environment an active crypto lobby abundant power from fossil and renewable sources open land disused factories while other places such as upstate new york have had greater incredulity when it comes to setting up mining operations in outmoded power stations or factories often requesting subsidies and tax abatements for vague promises of renewed employment texas has gone in the opposite direction betting big on bitcoin and other blockchain currencies now a proposed law written with help from the texas blockchain council would enshrine virtual currencies in the state’s commercial code if successful texas would join wyoming which enacted a similar law in since the bitmain fiasco cryptomining companies have been flocking to the arid locale in drovesthis past winter the londonbased argo blockchain announced plans to purchase a  plot in west texas for a  mining facility argo acquired a new yorkbased corporation that will give it access to up to  megawatts of electrical power in march hodl ranch a purportedly windpowered computational center for bitcoin mining and other gpudriven applications such as machine learning is another west texas operation run by the lone star state–based datacenter company skybox the website promises customers an “unmatched west texas experience” the peter thiel–backed  startup launched its texas enterprise last year and just this spring the us–based riot blockchain acquired a  facility for  million cash plus  million in shares riot has also been developing immersion cooling technology to fight the sweltering summer temperatures as of this writing bitcoin clocks in at just under  at the time of writing a number that has dropped more than  from yesterday and more than  since i began researching this article before elon musk turned on crypto one might laugh if it weren’t so apocalypticit’s hard to overstate the climactic impact of cryptocurrency bitmain’s rockdale facility alone would have demanded as much power as roughly  homes globally bitcoin mining uses more electricity than mediumsize countries like argentina and the netherlands and the specialized computers used by miners can’t be put to work for much else and rapidly become outmoded in a sector that prioritizes computational speed and scale above all ewaste is a ballooning issuecrypto’s comparability to texas’s rapacious oil economy is so obvious that it exceeds analogy—companies have been connecting mining machines to oil wells using the natural gas flares that go otherwise wasted to power them according to matt lohstroh the cofounder of one such east texas–based firm giga energy solutions flared natural gas is “some of the cheapest energy around” giga gets it for free or pays a “nominal” feewhile the viral images of wired crypto mines feeding off fossil fuels from oil wells represent to many the absurd reality of the  lohstroh sees it differently telling me via email that “natural gas will continue to be flared whether we are in the picture or not” although “it is by no means economical to start drilling for natural gas as the cost for drilling a well is ginormous” but for data scientist and tech columnist alex de vries using this wasted “excess” from oil drilling isn’t merely making the best of a bad situation “i don’t see it as a good thing to make a byproduct of fossil fuel extraction more profitable or profitable at all” de vries has said of these projects “it’s still producing emissions”texan cryptomining has also laid bare vulnerabilities in texas’s energy infrastructure during the historic storm in february that forced nearly  percent of state residents and businesses into darkness and cost more than  lives some cryptomines had to go offline as the power grid buckled others though sold electricity back at a profitas architectural theorist keller easterling argued in her  book extrastatecraft infrastructure is not just hidden mediums between physical modes of transportation utilities or communication but also overlapping signals systems standards laws and management styles “far from hidden” she writes “infrastructure is now the overt point of contact and access between us all—the rules governing the space of everyday life” for instance when hodl advertises its proximity to a highway an airport and a wind farm alongside an image of its private substation it is entangling prototypical infrastructure—transit and power lines—with that of the economic and legal systemsthe crypto landscape emerges not only from technological conditions but also from a specific regulatory regime cryptomining exists within a context of capitalist globalization and asymmetrical labor rights and costs that has emptied some of the world’s factories—like those of rockdale—to fill others its infrastructure is much larger much more encompassing than “mere” hundredacre data centers and wind farms and oil wellsdata’s manifestation as physical systems undermines the common conception of crypto—or the cloud or the internet—as intangible ideas but these ideas exist through globesnaring oceancrossing worldwarming landusing mineralextracting material substrates cryptomining exposes an infrastructure of data power and exchange that reveals what money—crypto or conventional—really is an abstraction cryptocurrency makes literal the fact that most glittery tech is merely the mystification and monetization of relatively unnovel modes of energy control as vicky osterweil put it in “money for nothing” a recent essay on nft art for real life “without the extractivists there is no way that the innovations of silicon valley which amount to little more than privatization by way of electrification would produce any profit” when it comes to crypto “mining” represents less an anachronistic metaphor than actuality the digital is never in the end dematerialized and these new currencies represent not a paradigm shift but a predictable next step in the capitalist race to the bottom down we keep digging
