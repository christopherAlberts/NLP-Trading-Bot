in  the journalist charles mackay published extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds his masterpiece in it he chronicled the economic bubbles and mass delusions that have plagued mankind across the ages “men… go mad in herds” he warned “while they only recover their senses slowly and one by one”the cryptocurrency bitcoin is a mania worthy of mackay nearly valueless just a decade ago its price reached an alltime high of over £ in april this year while the price has now dropped to little more than half that don’t be fooled much of the herd is still mad and bitcoin could remain irrationally valuable for a long while yetthere can be little doubt that bitcoin is madness it is after all a currency that is barely used as one in  it was estimated that just  percent of bitcoin transactions were made with retailers instead the overwhelming majority of bitcoin use is speculative tradeif bitcoin isn’t a currency then it must be an asset but its volatility makes it a bad asset too other assets with limited real use are at least stable gold for instance has held its value for centuries in the past two weeks alone the value of bitcoin fell by nearly  percentbut those who see this recent drop are wrong to write it off entirely after all a price of over £ is still an awful lot of money for a single unit of digital currency the first time bitcoin was ever used  coins bought two large pizzas at today’s prices those pizzas cost £ million apiecebitcoin will eventually collapse under the weight of its own absurdity as all speculative assets have before it but predicting when is a fool’s game after all as john maynard keynes famously warned those who try to pick the top of the market “the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent”there is in truth some rational underpinning to most speculative investing it is called gloriously the “greater fool theory” many speculators don’t really believe that the stock they have purchased is worth its current valuation instead they think that there is someone out there foolish enough to buy it off them at its overinflated price the speculator might be a fool but they invest on the assumption that there is a greater fool out there than thembitcoin investors do the same of course they buy bitcoin because they think they can sell it to someone else for a profit but bitcoin is different from most speculative stocks because it is even more irrational than most speculationto many bitcoin’s appeal is not just pecuniary it is political to buy bitcoin is to raise two fingers to the financial establishment because bitcoin is currency freed from the grip of central banks and the financial elite it is the financial manifestation of the antiestablishment politics of trump and brexitbitcoin isn’t just speculation it is also a statement of identity if speculation sounds irrational identity is less rational still “reason” wrote the enlightenment philosopher david hume “is slave to the passions” as recent years have shown us there are few passions stronger than a sense of our identityone day bitcoin enthusiasts will wake up to discover they were the greater fool and that their coins are worth nothing at all but you’d be foolish to try to guess when the price of bitcoin may have fallen but the passions are still running high as mackay observed we only come to our senses slowly the extraordinary popular delusion that is the madness of bitcoin will last a while yet
