bitcoin will destroy tyrannical order and replace it not with blind chaos and confusion but with an incorruptible foundation rules for life series essay twothe series continues if you’ve not yet read part one of the series you can find it hereforewordthe second chapter in jordan peterson “ rules for life” is entitled “treat yourself like someone who you are responsible for helping”it’s a fascinating chapter which delves into the essence of the human condition the roots of guilt sacrifice shame courage conscious action and a brilliant discussion on what some might term the essence of existence ie chaos and orderyou might wonder “what the hell does bitcoin have to do with this” or “how in the hell are you going to relate bitcoin to these ideas” i would agree with you that this is a challenge had the chapter been some unidimensional discussion about why you should be nice to yourself although perhaps the nicest thing you can do for your future self is to preserve the product of your labor or in other words buy bitcoinbut as usual jbp draws upon a very broad set of ideas and concepts for which similar to essay one i shall do my best to convey what i believe are some profound lessons and analogies in relation to bitcoin and its impact on individuals and the worldthe power of narrativejordan opens the chapter with some questionswhy is it that people don’t take care of themselvesfrom where does this guilt shame or selfloathing stemhe proceeds to then make an important point one that we both innately understand and that permeates all corners of the earthhuman beings are social creatures and we interpret the world around us in the form of stories or narrativeslong before we adopted the scientific method and to this day how we view the world is not through the purely objective lens of “that which it is” but via the more subjective lens of “what does it dowhat does it mean”the best way to think about this is the following diagramour minds perceive the stump and the chair as the same categoryit’s a “sitting thing” yes we can later rationalize the material differences between the objects but our instinct is to view and perceive the object in terms of what it means and therefore how we may use itthis distinction is at the core of all human behavior and is evident all throughout history from “the iliad” to the talmud “the vedas” to the bible through to priests and shamans or rumi shakespeare jung joseph campbell rand disney marvel heinlein and hollywoodstories archetypes mythology movies they all exist to help us understand what matters and enable us to find meaning in our actions this is perhaps the most critically human trait of all and is unfortunately something that’s lost on empiricists nihilists and utopian utilitariansso what does this have to do with bitcoinlet’s find outmatter and “what matters”as someone whose strongest academic suits in school were physics chemistry and engineering i have a deep appreciation for the scientific method and the scientific revolution the capacity to view interpret understand and then manipulate matter objectively is at the heart of technological progress in all civilizationswith that in mind i would also posit that while the “scientific method” was not very broadly understood or documented until the renaissance the process has existed since man first threw a rock or a stick at his prey we’ve always performed actions in the pursuit of what matters followed by some form of analysis into the material nature of the action such that we can improve itin other words human action reinforces the pursuit of what mattersthe only thing that’s really changed is the pace of progress in the study of matter it’s become exponential because it compounds the better we get at it the more technologically advanced we become and so forthand there is a drawback to thisin forgetting to ask or pursue what matters we find that matter alone just doesn’t really matterwe have become so focused on the empirical that we’ve forgotten the meaningful we’ve deconstructed everything from economics to art to philosophy and to psychology in some maniacal attempt to transform it into bits of meaningless data eg derrida and the rest of the deconstructionists from which nonsensical “models of the world” are then built and imposed on societybut the joke is on us to rephrase another villain trotsky’s “you might not be interested in war but it is interested in you”while we may have forgotten meaning meaning has not forgotten usin attempting to nullify and denigrate that critical component of existence we’ve seen everything from the rise of nihilism to dictatorial regimes and most recently the “religionization” of scienceaj cortes saying it like it is source twitterthe sheer force of narrative and how it can deform and derange the world or the populace in the absence of deeper meaning can be seen in modernity’s attempt to treat science as a religionthe realm of questioning has become a quasireligion no longer able to be questioned thus transforming into something that is no longer sciencethis is the streisand effect in actiontry and suppress meaning depth and the study of what matters and it rears its head up in strange deformed and deranged ways and  have been years of peak stupidity in many ways but this modern “scientism” is one of the shining examples wherequestioning “the science” has become a sinalternative viewpoints have become heresycritical thinking and individual decision making are for heathens and infidelsjust a few examples of what happensthis form of madness is now everywhereit exhibits all of the downsides of blind dogma while simultaneously being empty of substance in an attempt to be empirical and objectively superiorthey are literally creating paganlike celebrations to celebrate “facts” sourceit’s all deeply pathetic…but it wasn’t always like thisrenaissance  what matters meets matterthe renaissance was a period in which the study of what matters met the emerging study of matterit was a time of incredible transformation thinking creativity and discovery prior to that the world was largely plagued by dogma and an inability to effectively rise up out of poverty it’s as if one without the other is a bad recipewe’ve come a long way since the time of the galileos and the medicis we went from burning them at the stake to watching them transform the world in the industrial revolution and once again in the technological revolutionthis has brought incredible prosperity with it but over time and most recently we seem to have curtailed the study of what matters and got lost in pure desolate matterperhaps this is because “matter” is empirical and thus its study is more objective such knowledge compounds so you can better measure results and progress while the study of “what matters” is more timeless less changing more subjective and principled there was clearly an edge in adjusting your focus during this transformationwhatever it may be that shift in focus has become a decoupling and has resulted in some strange ramifications across many levels of societythe study of pure matter does not really care for examining complex tradeoffs wants desires and individuals because they’re far less measurable and not so empiricalmodernity has applied empirical approaches to things like economics ie modern monetary theorykeynesianism in an attempt to distill all human action into some set of equationsit has then made a series of ridiculous assumptions so that these equations can “seem to work” by representing some isolated subset of reality ignoring the fact that there is real world cost associated with what was discarded inflation is a great examplefurthermore because it fits some fantasy empirical model some have chosen to believe they can use it as a justification for mandates and dictates because “nothing really matters it’s only just numbers”this is dangerous on so many levelsbut bitcoin fixes thisbitcoin reminds us why natural economics aka austrian economics philosophy ssychology morality ethics and history are so important they help us understand that tradeoffs exist and guide us away from the runaway destruction that can occur in the pursuit of utilitarian endsthe renaissance  matter meets what mattersbitcoin is truly the second renaissanceby tying the physical to the metaphysical bitcoin reunites matter to what matters as such it has the capacity to heal the world in the most deep and meaningful of waysthe “bitcoin fixes this” meme may sound trite but it’s extraordinarily nuanced and accurate the first second third and subsequent order effects of demonopolizing the resource via which human action is measured stored and exchanged and then anchoring it to the second law of thermodynamics are profound with it we have an unprecedented opportunity to rebuild society on a sound foundation it’s the closest we can get to true equality of opportunityi also believe it’s our only path through “the great filter”bitcoin is that “freak event” that changes everythingan incorruptible fixed supply money enables humans to effectively measure manage and transact the product of their labor it allows value to be created transformed and transmitted with minimal distortion and trends toward the elimination of waste and falsehoodsone cannot celebrate fake facts in the face of an economic reality tied to the physical laws of thermodynamicsbitcoin permits maximum fidelity human action to permeate society and as a result some important things occurthe goodusefulfunctional can compound and proliferatethe baduselessbroken can correct or disappeartradeoffs are not only more evident but inescapablerisk can no longer be hidden and subsequent losses socialized skin is now in the game for everyonethis framework unifies matter and what matters because the lies necessary to separate the two can no longer existthe study of what matters the pursuit of truth of principles and of meaning can once again be anchored to reality and vice versa the study and evolution of matter can operate within the framework and toward ends that matterthis will have profound implications for humanity and marks what may be the most important fork in the road since homosapiens separated from other hominidschaos and orderlet’s shift gears now and explore chaos and orderjbp reminds us that the world of experience what matters can also be reduced to its primal constituentschaosorderconsciousnessin fact the idea of consciousness as the point at which chaos meets order is so profound that it may be where not only the meaning of life emerges but the very thing we actually call lifeanything too far on one side or the other no longer represents that which is alive — a topic i look forward to exploring deeper in future workfor now let’s reference jbp againchaos is also the formless potential from which the god of genesis  called forth order using language at the beginning of time it’s the same potential from which we made in that image call forth the novel and everchanging moments of our lives chaos is freedom dreadful freedom too order by contrast is explored territory that’s the hundredsofmillions ofyearsold hierarchy of place position and authority that’s the structure of society it’s the structure provided by biology too — particularly insofar as you are adapted as you are to the structure of society but order is sometimes tyranny and stultification as well when the demand for certainty and uniformity and purity becomes too onesided peterson  rules for lifethere are so many threads to pull on here in relation to bitcoin one could write an entire book about it i’ll try to pull on a few and link to work done by some brilliant minds including one of my favorites gigibitcoin enables living order to emerge from chaosthe very nature of bitcoin’s time chain is something that’s designed to take the sum total of all human action measured in the chaos of all transactions in every market across the entire globe and transform it into a set of blocks in chronological order via the probabilisticallysound process of using work to achieve consensus amongst a network of participants who do not know each otherthis is the most incredibly complex but powerfully elegant innovation in human historywith bitcoin the chaos that is the free market can discover relevant order information can flow between all network participants in a manner that is uninhibited and not subject to power lossbitcoin is an information and energy superconductorthis is the fundamental function of moneya transmission medium for information value and actionwithout it no order can be achievedthis is why sound money is so fundamentally importantbitcoin embodies chaos and orderbitcoin not only enables the emergence of functional organic order from chaos but it embodies the same process in the way it functionsin a sense the bitcoin organism ‘grows’ on the edge between order and chaos finding new blocks is a chaotic process and its result is a very orderly list of transactions the bitcoin blockchain also known as the ledger  der gigibitcoin takes random unstructured chaotic information from the market and using incentives proof of work and cryptography transforms it into an ordered global ledger that anyone anywhere can validate and verifyimage courtesy of gigijust like all life forms bitcoin is an antientropic force that has a direction but emerges at the nexus of chaos and orderi would strongly recommend a read of gigi’s article entitled “bitcoin’s eternal struggle” where he dives into this deeperwith bitcoin chaos and order can dancefor life to exist chaos must dance with order too much of one or the other and life will cease to existorder has to emerge from chaos and in the process create a new form of higher order chaos that we can contend with this dance is in my opinion the basis of all existencewe can understand it as followschaos must initially exist for order to emerge this is the essence of creation and “opportunity” one person’s order is another person’s chaos this subjective nature of chaos and order especially at the individual level is important magnification matters at one level the system looks chaotic but on a higher level order is clearly manifest this is perhaps a more taoist viewpoint but also aligns well with the fractal nature of lifeon a fiat standard chaos and order continually clash this is because fiat order is artificial and top down instead of being emergentinstead of the forced order creating further opportunity it suffocates mobility and experimentation this generates lower quality problems which are then used to justify further arbitrary “fiat order” to deal with it it’s like running on a treadmill that sucks up resources time and energyas discussed in essay one emergent order evolves over time and corrects in order to stay functional and relevant if we attempt to remove the feedback mechanism the system cannot correct the form of order decays and lower forms of chaos ensue in ways that cannot be measured or anticipatedthe principles of chaos and order are related to hierarchy and territory at a deep level they’re all a dancewhen a hierarchy becomes too rigid or top heavy it naturally fractures and from the rubble can be rebuilt when territory gets too large and homogenous it begins to fracture and find a new dynamic equilibriumthis melody and the dance permeate all of existence it’s when we try to “fix” or stagnate the dance that things begin to decaytry to restrict natural chaos too much and it will corrupt the order it encapsulateschaos is the water that erodes the cliff faceit’s the snake in the garden you cannot removeits rose in a concrete worldit’s the sunlight that seeps in through the cracksunleash chaos without regard to objective realities emergent principles and functional boundaries and you no longer have freedom you just have noiseorder is the discipline that gives the individual freedomit’s the foundation upon which you build your home be it your house your family or your legacyit’s the structure in your dayit’s the shared standard that enables communication travel and exchangecertainty and uncertaintyinspired by maslow’s hierarchy tony robbins’ model of understanding human behavior via the “six human needs” is one of the most powerful i’ve come acrossit’s like maslow’s hierarchy meets chaos and order meets taoismone of the most powerful aspects of the framework is the polarity of each of the needs they are as followsrobbins’ six human needs frameworkchaos and order align perfectly with the base level of the human needs certainty and uncertaintyin fact the lefthand side is generally more akin to order while the righthand side to chaos in the realm of order you find the individual and in the realm of chaos you find the chaotic relationship to “other”i’d like to explore this much further but it’s beyond the scope of this articlefor now let it remind us that many have converged upon these truths from different backgrounds at different points in timein many ways it’s like the consensus achieved by a network of participants who perform work and voluntarily choose to adopt a set of transparent immutable rulesthis is the nature of objective truthconsciousness and human actionexistence and life occur at the nexus of chaos and orderthis nexus in the context of humans is consciousness and it gives rise to human action the most fundamental form of speechin order for us each to act navigate reality and transform chaos into order we need information feedback and signals the more clear and accurate these are the more effectively and efficiently we can perform human action at an individual level and therefore collectivelytherein lies the history of human civilizationnatural alchemistsas humans we transform chaos into orderin fact the most accurate metaphysical definition of capitalism is “the process of transforming chaos into order”by taking scarce natural resources and mixing them with our finite individual resources our time and our energy we attempt to create transform and innovate to make the future more certain and orderlythis is alchemy at its most basic level and in this sense bitcoin is the philosopher’s stonefiat or monopolized money on the other hand inhibits the capacity of the individual and society at large to perform this processprice signals are destroyed and hence so is the information required for innovation to take placeprice is the information market participants use to make decisions and convert unknown into known we cannot make accurate sensible decisions without itfurthermore when the game is rigged you destroy the natural corrective mechanism needed for structures to remain robust — and you disincentivize people from even wanting to perform this natural transformative functionwhy would you if no matter what you do order is created for others and your chaos only continuesthis is the moral hazard of the “heads i win tails you lose” game that the “state” is able to play by maintaining a monopoly on moneythe garden of eden and the serpentcapitalism is not about protectionit builds safety through strength as opposed to weakness through safetythe serpent in the garden is the everlasting entity that exists to remind us that there is always something to strive for the serpent represents “problems” which is another way of saying “opportunity”problems are a sign of life norman vincent pealehumans are problem solving machines and serpent tamerswe build gardens which are a manifestation of chaos and order where nature meets structure and we do so because we have encountered the serpentit makes us stronger wiser betterif we completely inhibit the opportunity to encounter the serpent we not only weaken ourselves but the serpent will emerge from withinthere is no escaping it there is only the choice of “how” you will face itin this sense bitcoin is the most powerful weapon it is borne of pure personal responsibility it is the sword you keep sheathed in a world where you know the serpent can and will come with it you are prepared you are strong you are vitalthe naked apehumans are flawed we are self conscious ashamed fearful and fragilebeing upright displays our most vulnerable parts an evolutionary path that made specific tradeoffs such that we became social by natureour upright nakedness makes us self consciousunsettled by this we often fear to tell the truth we fear mediating between chaos and order and choose to retreat into the comfort of safety despite how thin the veneer of that illusion may bealongside this notion we also have the capacity to strengthen ourselves to become proud courageous examples of all that is possible we do this despite our vulnerabilityit’s this seemingly paradoxical nature of humanity that makes it so powerfultrue courage the grandest of virtues lies in acknowledging our fears our flaws and our shortcomings but proceeding onwards anywaythis is what is meant by “walking with god” an act that requires faithbut faith requires courage and if you stripmine courage out of the individual by cushioning them into numbness you remove their capacity to walk with godyou turn them into serfs who will do the minimum amount just so they can continue to existthis is the danger of a world in which we attempt to control by fiat where we attempt to eliminate uncertainty and replace it with artificial sterile certaintynothing can be completely walled off from the rest of realitythe idea of isolation does not existchaos will always seep into order no matter what we try because existence requires both the only question is are you sheltered and weak or are you prepared and strongthe snake in the garden of eden is a metaphor not only for the evil that resides “out there” but also that which is found insidethe worst of all snakes is the eternal human proclivity for evil this is psychological spiritual personal internal no walls no matter how tall will keep that out jordan petersoneven if the walls were strong enough to keep all evil and bad out it would appear once again withinthe line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being aleksandr solzhenitsynstrength or safetythere is no way to isolate society from the rest of humanity without sanitizing it into nonexistencewould you rather have the illusion of “safety” or the reality of strengthbeauty will always shame the uglystrength will always shame the weakdeath will always shame the livingthese are immutable truths and exist so that humanity can strive for something other than the low level needs like safety security and certaintyimagine a world without danger in which we no longer required strength courage curiosity or cunning in order to survivethere is a reason we admire these attributes and know them as virtuesa world in their absence is a banal dry sterile world in which humans are no longer present a world in which depth and meaning can no longer be foundthis is the utilitarian utopian ideal that people such as aldous huxley warned us ofemptinessto walk with godbitcoin is a manifestation of objective trutha consensus of the many adopted and enforced by the individualit enables human beings to build their heaven and earn their immortalityheaven is something you must buildimmortality is something you must earnit gives them a way to compound their good decisions and directly learn from their bad oneswith truth with bitcoin we can once again walk with god despite the tragedy of self consciousness much like christ’s example showed us how to accept finitude death and pain heroically and not as victims bitcoin will enable the transformation of the world from serfs into sovereign individualsstrong responsible forthrightin closingbitcoin is not about blindly bringing down the social orderbitcoin is about creating a base of emergent order derived from the chaotic consensus achieved by individuals who voluntarily choose to enforce rules for themselvesbitcoin will destroy both tyrannical order and that which masquerades as order and replace it not with blind chaos and confusion but with an incorruptible foundation from which meritocracies and organic hierarchies of competence can once again emergewithout a mechanism to anchor subjective reality into the objective nature of the physical world individuals and society at large can quickly deteriorate and go off course like a rudderless boat in a sea of
