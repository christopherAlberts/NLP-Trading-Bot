it has been a lively month for cryptocurrencies between volatile markets and elon musk’s dogecoin antics on saturday night live amid it all a small chorus of business leaders current and former policymakers and commentators have begun musing about banning technologies like bitcoin altogether in the united states this proposition arises for different reasons and in various degrees of seriousness taking such drastic action however would be imprudent and shortsightedthere are numerous debates raging about whether bitcoin is good bad or ugly but the sweeping suggestion to outlaw bitcoin raises three broader issues regardless of one’s perspective on any given cryptocurrencyfirst is the overarching principle of technology neutrality—that we should develop policies and laws that apply evenhandedly across technologies and time for instance if we say we do not like bitcoin because it can be used by bad actors would that position also apply neutrally to other financial technologies and instruments the badactor scenario could also occur with a duffle bag filled with  bills the us treasury department has printed about twelve billion  bills  percent of which are in circulation outside the country additionally would a bitcoin ban apply equally to other digital assets that cost more than  the current value of bitcoin—or  or even second we have to think through what a firm ban would actually mean for an asset that an estimated fortysix million americans now own would the plan be to prosecute anyone who does not hand over their bitcoin and threaten them with jail time criminalizing  percent of the us population for mere possession of encryption keys would pose a form of mass incarceration that is among other things antithetical to the current political consensus on criminaljustice reform how many thousands of judicial proceedings would the confiscation of all those bitcoin require would the federal government plan to reimburse citizens for the billions in dollars in property it confiscates by way of comparison in the  the us government ordered restrictions on certain uses of gold which were the subject of intense litigation and were narrowly upheld by the supreme court notably the right to own gold was restored in the third democratic values must inform us policies around cryptocurrencies over the past week chinese vice premier liu he initiated a “crack down on bitcoin mining and trading” and iran imposed a hardline ban on mining in response a former senior treasury department official said that the united states “ought to follow china on this one and really clamp down on crypto” but china’s record of clampdowns—both online and in the physical world—is not something the united states should blithely seek to emulate democratic nations do not unilaterally “clamp down” on things that some may dislike we deliberate promulgate regulations andor enact legislation moreover the united states regularly and rightly criticizes other nations particularly china for clamping down on an open internet which should give americans serious pause about flirting with a categorical ban on a decentralized internet protocolother commentators have made sweeping assertions like saying that the privacy features of some cryptocurrencies are mainly “useful for criminals” that is plainly incorrect as a matter of law and history the late us supreme court justice louis brandeis famously extolled the importance of the right to privacy in the  and  centuries congress overwhelmingly passed a statute entitled the “right to financial privacy act” in  and the supreme court has held that the right to privacy undergirds other important constitutional rights privacy is an enduring american value that applies to everything from the sanctity of our homes to the right to buy contraceptivesthe colonial pipeline hack has raised new questions about whether banning bitcoin could help defuse the global ransomware problem but ransomware predated the adoption of cryptocurrency for example in  a largescale ransomware attack against scientists required them to send a cashier’s check or money order to a po box in panama people sometimes do bad things with paper cash including using it for ransom payments rather than attempting to prohibit the latest medium of exchange it would be better to step up corporate and nationallevel cyber defenses crypto ransom payments are not totally untraceable either an analytics company that works with law enforcement has already managed to start tracking the colonial pipeline payment try that with a pile of benjaminsconstructive conversations lie ahead about appropriately regulating digital currencies plural for instance how do we incentivize the use of renewable energy for cryptocurrencies that are more electricityintensive protect consumers from excessive risk and trace money launderers who take advantage of new technologies these are legitimate issues that require careful consideration what’s needed now is greater interagency coordination within the us government and clearer rules rather than regulatory fiefdoms and piecemeal enforcement but concrete progress is not going to start by waking up one day fuming at the latest price of bitcoin and musing about a “clamp down” that is more of a fever dream than serious policy and it should subside soon
