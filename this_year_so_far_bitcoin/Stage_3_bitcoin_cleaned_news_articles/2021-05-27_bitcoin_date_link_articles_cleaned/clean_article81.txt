bitcoin btc has been a hot topic of discussion lately even for those outside the core crypto community but unfortunately it’s not for the best of reasons in particular the amount of energy required to mine bitcoin has created concerns for investors who were considering btc as an option to diversifyaccording to the cambridge center for alternative finance bitcoin currently consumes around  terawatthours per year a harvard business review article further noted that this equates to  of global electricity production which is roughly equivalent to that of a small countyalthough this is the case it’s important to point out that any industry that adds value to society will likely have an environmental impact yet with the rise of global warming and other environmental concerns today it’s become crucial for the crypto sector to recognize the amount of energy consumption required to mine bitcoin as this concern is brought to fruition individuals within the cryptocurrency community can then come up with solutions to combat this challenge moving forwardtoday’s green solution carbonneutral bitcoin fundsinfluential executives and crypto investors like elon musk and michael saylor continue to highlight bitcoin’s energy consumption challenges on twitter in order to raise awareness for the future of bitcoin most recently musk and saylor announced the formation of a bitcoin mining council which consists of several industry leaders who will ultimately enable sustainable bitcoin mining initiativeswhile this is a step in the right direction it may take years for this bitcoin mining council to make a real impact jesse morris chief commercial officer of energy web — a blockchain protocol designed to facilitate application development for the energy sector — told cointelegraph that while it’s encouraging that musk and saylor are tweeting about a new bitcoin mining council actions must be taken immediatelymorris explained that energy web is currently working directly with a number of bitcoin miners to build software that leverages blockchain technology to detect in near realtime the carbon footprint of the bitcoin network morris noted“i wish the bitcoin community would move to a more efficient consensus mechanism but i don’t think this will happen so we have to come up with a solution now to fix the challenges with proofofwork consensus”morris further believes that a nearterm solution to begin enabling a greener bitcoin network could be through the development of carbonneutral exchangetraded fundsalthough carbonneutral etfs may sound like a foreign concept some investment management firms have already taken steps to ensure just this for example torontobased ninepoint partners lp is an independent investment management firm with about  billion in assets under management alex tapscott managing director of digital assets at ninepoint told cointelegraph that bitcoin makes up a good portion of the assets under the firm’s management “crypto assets are a fastgrowing and important asset class for us” he notedninepoint created a bitcoin trust that went public on the toronto stock exchange in january of this year the bitcoin trust was then converted to an etf on may  following the news of ninepoint’s bitcoin etf tapscott explained that the firm decided to offset  of its fund’s carbon footprint to ensure that interested investors receive green exposure to bitcoin“by absorbing the cost of bitcoin’s carbon footprint we are giving investors an option to get green exposure to bitcoin we think this is a unique and important offering that will help convince investors that have been on the fence about buying bitcoin”according to tapscott ninepoint is partnering with a number of initiatives to help ensure the firm’s green bitcoin etf for example ninepoint is working with the crypto carbon ratings institute a research company focused on the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies along with carbonx an environmental software fintech firmlena klaassen cofounder of the crypto carbon ratings institute told cointelegraph that the firm uses its own methodologies and research to compute the best estimate of the real carbon footprint of the bitcoin network together with carbonx the crypto carbon ratings institute reports to ninepoint regarding its etf’s share of the bitcoin network carbonx then uses its zerofootprint practice which supplies the commensurate volumes of  or carbon dioxide equivalent to counterbalance the pollutionwhile tapscott was unable to disclose specific numbers regarding the fund’s carbon footprint he explained that this is mainly because the assets under management fluctuate as new investors come in and as the price of bitcoin changes “the energy footprint of bitcoin changes with its hashing rate this is a moving target that we adjust monthly to reflect these changes” he remarkedeven with market fluctuations and the cost of offsetting the carbon footprint being funded entirely by ninepoint tapscott noted that the firm views this as the right thing to do both for the future of the company and for the entire crypto sector at large tapscott said“there are plenty of investors who want exposure to bitcoin but they question its energy footprint especially the institutions that have environmental social governance esg goals to meet”green funds — an ongoing trendwhile there are still very few cryptoasset management investment firms that have pledged to go green efforts of some firms could very well create a powerful movementshortly after ninepoint announced its green bitcoin etf one river digital asset management filed for a carbonneutral etf one river declined to speak with cointelegraph about the matter yet tapscott noted that he hopes ninepoint’s green initiative serves as a model for the entire industryalthough it’s hard to predict the future of the crypto space it’s encouraging to see that bitmex a crypto derivatives trading platform also recently announced the decision to go carbon neutral in addition marathon digital holdings a united statesbased enterprise bitcoin mining company revealed plans to achieve  of carbon neutrality klaassen added that the crypto carbon ratings institute is now seeing a trend for btc mining companies — especially ones that are publicly traded — to assess their own scope  and  emissions in order to address thempaul brody blockchain lead at ernst  young further told cointelegraph that carbonneutral mining operations are definitely possible “if you plan to only hold the bitcoin you mine in a carbonneutral operation you have a green solution” he saidhowever brody pointed out that if someone were to transact with bitcoin one may not be able to know for sure that the transaction will be processed by a carbonneutral miner brody said“you cannot know the history of those transactions however if you combine a carbon neutral mining operation with some level of carbonoffset against your other transactions you most likely have a largely green bitcoin operation”a longterm solution for bitcoinwhile bitcoin etfs investment management firms and mining companies continue to pledge to go carbon neutral a longerterm solution is still needed in order for a green bitcoin to become a lasting realityfor the long term morris believes that accords that adhere to official standards must be established in order to ensure this energy web recently launched its crypto climate accord which morris noted has  supporters consisting of miners crypto investors foundations exchanges and more the goal of the accord is to make bitcoin entirely renewable by focusing on two aspectsmorris mentioned that the accord aims to raise awareness around “greenwashing” according to morris “clean crypto funds” are cause for skepticism as blockchain networks that don’t use a traditional proofofwork consensus do not consume anywhere near the amount of energy as bitcoin doesas such morris believes that the conversation around energy conservation should be focused on bitcoin specifically morris also explained that the crypto climate accord will take steps to help large scale institutional and retail investors make their bitcoin green by bringing radical transparency to the bitcoin networkhowever a challenge that still needs to be addressed is the development of standards according to morris energy web is currently looking into developing a global standard for tracking bitcoin’s carbon footprintin addition the crypto community must also continuously work toward an environmentally friendly solution for bitcoin bill tapscott chief operating officer of carbonx told cointelegraph that “although a carbonneutral path has been set forth the crypto community itself has to embrace a responsibility to transition to a lowercarbon world”
