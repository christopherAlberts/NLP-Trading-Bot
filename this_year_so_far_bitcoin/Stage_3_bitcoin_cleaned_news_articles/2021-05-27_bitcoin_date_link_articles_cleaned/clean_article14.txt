the may  ransomware shutdown of colonial pipeline resulting in the payment of nearly  million to the group responsible for hacking the corporation illustrates how the ransomware epidemic is now out of hand beyond just the colonial pipeline hack this single ransomware gang darkside has successfully earnedamassedextorted  million in revenue in half a year and the number of similar gangs is proliferating so much that one needs a scorecard to keep track of them all conservative estimates suggest the costs of direct extortion will be in the billions this year alone and collateral damage to the economy is undoubtedly one or two orders of magnitude morebut in the end this cyber pandemic is not a result of a ransomware problem instead it’s because society has a bitcoin problemback in the late  the world faced a different enterprise of russian criminal actors with spammers targeting viagra and other pharmaceuticals like today’s ransomware multiple gangs operated with an affiliate model where the gangs provided the infrastructure and the affiliates compromised the targeted machines through spamming efforts then as now russian authorities generally didn’t intervene as long as the spammers didn’t disrupt russian computers or bring law enforcement into their internal squabbles these late  gangs grossed roughly  million a year while causing consequential damages easily an order of magnitude higherat the time it looked almost impossible for foreign law enforcement to combat these operations these criminals were clearly outside the reach of us law and were sheltered by a russian government that viewed cybercrime as a profit center as long as the impacts weren’t localized but the research group i was then a member of showed pfizer how to eliminate the viagra spam problemour study started with obtaining nearly a billion spam messages we then built infrastructure to read these messages and automatically visit the advertised websites along the way we traced all this infrastructure then we completed the process by purchasing items such as fake watches and overthecounter pharmaceuticals to discover the complete chain needed for a spammer to turn pharmaceutical spam into profitin selling these identified spamvertized pharmaceuticals the attackers could create arbitrary websites and arbitrary domain names making it impossible to say “these are the bad spamsites remove them” although they dropshipped products from international locations they still needed to process credit card payments and at the time almost all the gangs used just three banks this revelation which was highlighted in a new york times story resulted in the closure of the gangs’ bank accounts within days of the story this was the beginning of the end for the spam viagra industry one of the major gang operators posted portions of our paper on a russian cybercrime forum the next day ending his rant with a gripe that translated to “fing scientists always at it again” and a picture of a mushroom cloudsubsequently any spammer who dared use the “viagra” trademark would quickly find their ability to accept credit cards irrevocably compromised as someone would perform a test purchase to find the receiving bank and then pfizer would send the receiving bank a nastygram in less than a year the viagra spam business effectively died with one russian cybercriminal remarking “fing visa is burning us with napalm” if the criminals’ ability to process payments can be disrupted so can their ability to operateas a society we also saw the effectiveness of payment interdiction in the first major ransomware epidemic back in  and  various ransomwares proliferated including one purporting to involve the fbi some of these previousgeneration ransomwares would accept either bitcoin or green dot moneypaks and targeted retail victims by trying to extort a couple hundred dollars fortunately this scheme never metastasized because bitcoin was grossly inconvenient and now can’t even work for small transactions with each costing nearly  as of april  meanwhile green dot cleaned up its act considerably in response to the financial crimes enforcement network and congressional pressure to remedy its role in these criminal effortsnow a new threat has emerged—“biggame ransomware” these operations target companies instead of individuals in an attempt to extort millions rather than hundreds of dollars at a time the revenues are large enough that some gangs can even specialize and develop zeroday vulnerabilities for specialized software even the cryptocurrency community has noted that ransomware is a bitcoin problem multimilliondollar ransoms paid in bitcoin now seem to be commonplacethis strongly suggests that the best way to deal with this new era of biggame ransomware will involve not just securing computer systems after all you can’t patch against a zeroday vulnerability or prosecuting since russia clearly doesn’t care to either extradite or prosecute these criminals it will also require disrupting the one payment channel capable of moving millions at a time outside of money laundering laws bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently there are various methods that can degrade disrupt or destroy the cryptocurrency spaceothers may argue that with so much money involved the bad guys will find another way i strongly disagree there are only three existing mechanisms capable of transferring a  million ransom—a banktobank transfer cash or cryptocurrencies no other mechanisms currently exist that can meet the requirements of transferring millions of dollars at a timethe ransomware gangs can’t use normal banking even the most blatantly corrupt bank would consider processing ransomware payments as an existential risk my group and i noticed this with the viagra spammers the spammers’ banks had a choice to either unbank the bad guys or be cut off from the financial system the same would apply if ransomware tried to use wire transferscash is similarly a nonstarter a  million ransom is  pounds  kilograms in  bills or two fullweight suitcases arranging such a transfer to an extortionist operating outside the us is clearly infeasible just from a physical standpoint the ransomware purveyors need transfers that don’t require physical presence and a hundred pounds of stuffthis means that cryptocurrencies are the only tool left for ransomware purveyors so if governments take meaningful action against bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies they should be able to disrupt this new ransomware plague and then eradicate it as was seen with the spam viagra industryfor in the end we don’t have a ransomware problem we have a bitcoin problem
