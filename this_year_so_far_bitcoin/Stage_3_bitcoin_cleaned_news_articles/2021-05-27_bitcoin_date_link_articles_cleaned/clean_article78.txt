memeinspired cryptocurrency eleven years later shibainu inspired crypto coins are running wild investors buying memebased coins are probably imagining becoming overnight crypto millionaires unfortunately just because early dogecoin buyers may have done well doesnt mean every joke coin will be a winner there is a much more stable and potentially lucrative way to profit from cryptocurrency thats far less likely to leave investors chasing their tailsnot a joke anymorethe doge meme spawned dogecoin cryptodoge in  the dogecoin website describes the crypto as a fun and friendly internet currencythe original point of dogecoin might have been to just have fun but for investors having fun means making money and the  pandemic seems to have changed cryptos growth curve as laidoff people sought ways to make quick money they increasingly turned to trading cryptocurrency in march of  chinese search engine baidu nasdaqbidu reported searches for bitcoin increased  over the prior year

firms and crypto exchanges helped them trade crypto in record volumesthe beginning of  changed many things for dogecoin and crypto in general dogecoin increased roughly eightfold in the first five weeks of the new year the coin took a breather until about midapril when the price jumped again to a new high of  just a few weeks later the coin breached its highest point exceeding  to put this into perspective an investment of just  in dogecoin on jan  at  per coin would have been worth more than  by the high point in maythis getrichquick scenario seems to give insight into why some are willing to buy coins worth a fraction of a cent the new york times suggests that years of low interest rates massive student loans and housing price inflation are causing some investors to take what it calls the trampoline approach to investing instead of a steady growth approach with a diversified portfolio theyre looking for a moonshot investment that will change their financial future at worst theyll only land back where they were before investors who feel like they missed the move in dogecoin may now be enamored with the next great memecoinchallenging the alpha dogunwilling to let one dog rule the yard the shiba token crypto shib was introduced as an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building in other words shiba was created to see whether a community could support a token with no technological advantage over other coinsanother dog nipping at dogecoins heels is the kishu inu crypto kishu token this meme coins main differentiating factor is the promise of instant rewards each time a buy or sell is completed  of the transaction is ditributed to existing holders if we look closely at dogecoin shiba and kishu there are similarities that should worry most investorsall three tokens have either massive or unlimited bases to issue tokens from all three were created either as a joke or as an experiment not to solve a problem in the marketplace the use of influencers is a key component of how these coins expect to expand their popularitytoken or coin market cap number of potential coins influencers dogecoin  billion unlimited elon musk mark cuban shiba token nearly

supply the lower the price this helps explain why bitcoin cryptobtc is still worth around  per coin even after a massive correction there will never be more than approximately  million bitcoins bitcoin is thought of as the gold of the cryptocurrency world using this same theory you might start to understand why shiba tokens and other joke coins are widely referred to as  um  we cant print it here but its a far more scatological rhyming version of bitcoinsthough dogecoin gets a lot of press it doesnt exist to solve a problem for investors looking for a pure play in the crypto space there are likely better options than chasing a bunch of dogsgrowth and income from ethereumduring the california gold rush you could either mine for gold and hope to strike it rich or be the one selling picks and shovels think of ethereum cryptoeth as the shovel that the doggiememe coins need to find their fortune both the shiba token and the kishi inu token run on the ethereum blockchain in this way eth could be a longterm beneficiary of all this dog inspired investingone point of clarity eth is the actual token you buy ethereum is the blockchain that runs the different apps and services every time you send eth or use an application on the ethereum network you pay a small fee this fee is incentive to a miner a record keeper to check and make sure no one is cheatingthe ethereum blockchain is also attempting to address one of the concerns about bitcoin the power it consumes bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies including etherium currently run and secure their networks by asking ultrapowerful computer chips to crunch difficult mathematical calculations using massive amounts of energy in the process while some of that energy comes from renewable sources bitcoin miners also often draw on airpolluting fossil fuels like coal and natural gas to feed their hunger for electricityeth  offers a potential solution to this power usage by changing how the ethereum blockchain works instead of requiring raw computing power to process transactions and mine new coins eth  will ask users to stake some portion of their existing crypto holdings to help verify that its network is running correctly the more of their holdings they stake to help the network stay secure the more the network rewards them with interest payments instead of treating cryptocurrencies as assets that will appreciate in value like stocks eth  staking solution could transform them into incomeproducing investments more like bonds dividend stocks or savings accountsfor income investors crypto might not even make their radar but eth  could change that quickly atomic wallet which makes one of the most popular ways for users to store crypto coins expectats an apr of somewhere in the  to  annual range for staking eth in fact coinbase global nasdaqcoin already offers a  apr on any amount of eth staked with no minimum requirement admittedly there are other cryptocurrencies that allow staking but eth  is the first time the second largest crypto by market cap will have this option embedded into its networkthird and most importantly ethereum is being used every day to solve real world problems if you need to send money to anyone with an ethereum wallet the transfer takes mere minutes if you want to borrow lend or conduct transactions with certain conditions ethereum does that tooethereum is a cryptocurrency investment with a longterm value proposition with the move to eth  growth and income investors have a new option to consider  and unlike the pack of dog coins its no joke eth has already seen close to  billion staked for the benefit of eth  upgrades investors can easily track this staking progress the larger the staking pool the more secure the upgraded network will be the ethereum network publicly explains its planned upgrades and investors can track these expansions each step of the way as long as eth  follows its current roadmap growth and income investors might have a frontrow seat to watch a real moonshot take place in their portfolios
