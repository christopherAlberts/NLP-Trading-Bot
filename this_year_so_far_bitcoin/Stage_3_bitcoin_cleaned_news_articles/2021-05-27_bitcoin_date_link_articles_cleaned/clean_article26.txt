welcome back to cooks kitchenlast week i explained what the bitcoin faithful were missing about their precious digital gold in this article and videobitcoin crash lessons passionate belief still needs risk managementand in the past week ive had many conversations about those views even publicly on twitter you can always follow me kevinbcook to eavesdrop in realtime but ill share one exchange that was right up our alleyfirst the premise the acerbic wit of one oj renick anchor extraordinaire of the td ameritrade network investing broadcast coined an important new market acronym wednesday to describe and warn bitcoin faithful about what was happening in their minds and marginbased accountsit was mud maniacal unwavering devotionand it was a beautiful contribution to the conversation i began last weeksecond the interaction immediately ojs tweet about his article explaining mud published on his linkedin blog drew some very important firea crypto thought leader wrotei dont know a single crypto thought leader that warned people of the upcoming bitcoin crash quoting oj renick from his articlehe proceedswhy should i a public proponent of accumulating bitcoin for the long term encourage people to gamble their bitcoin by trying to time unpredictable marketsand here was my immediate replyexactly the question needs to be asked  answered i proposed last week that faithful fundamentalists ignore that even a revolutionary new asset class trades at market prices susceptible to human emotional extremes bubbles  crashes think of newbs following  buying at my point as always here was that its fine for btc thought leaders to engage in fantasies of accumulating their precious for the inevitable surges to  and  but the average follower with less than  to spare cant really handle or understand the  crashesuntil bitcoin has quantifiable use cases and big institutional support think buying from blackrock jpmorgan and central banks the fundamental value of it is hard to model let alone quantify that means its trading mostly on emotional speculation and passionatelyheld beliefs or influential whims and changes of heart elon if you musk ask whodont get me wrong in my piece last week i argued that bitcoin is an entirely new asset class for the digital age and there are good reasons that its  better  and more volatile  than that barbarous relic goldso maybe we should warn new btc investors about possibilities for wild randomness as the great benoit mandelbrot described the central feature of complex and chaotic markets after i understood what he and nassim taleb were trying to teach us about volatility in humanbuilt systems i realized that when anything can happen there is no standard for deviationthe semi ecosystem is a rich jungle of investing opportunitieswhile some coiners look for opportunity in the hundreds of altcoins that may go from a thousandth of a cent to  cents  for a  windfall  those dreams will remain as infrequent as they are randomwhat im encouraging investors to do is look at the companies building the actual infrastructure of the cryptoblockchain spaceand thats what ive been focused on for the month of may with deeper dives into the sales and earnings growth of micron mu applied materials amat and nvidiaon wednesday morning i published a piece on asml holding nv asml the netherlandsbased giant of photolithography for integrated circuit ic manufacturethat article spins a few quick circles around many of the players that we find most important in the buildout of the nanosphere that was my new term last year for the world of  nanometer technology that was becoming crucial to the next stages of ics for phones cars medicine and aerospacebut then i found that futurist and technology guru george gilder calls it the nanocosm and im going with him since he is probably the best independent semiconductor researcher on the planet he is also the author of the  book microcosm the quantum era in economics and technology which set the stage for a whole generation of investors and technologists to understand this invisible world of power lawsbe sure to check out the article on asml linked above to find out which megainvestor just became the  largest holder of asml shares in nvidia is taking it down way downin the video attached to this article i talk a bit about nvidia nvda innovation heading down to the  level for its nextgen gpu architecture hopper since nvidia contracts taiwan semiconductor or tsmc to build this hardware word gets out in the supply chain and digitimes has been reporting on this mystery chipset for the past yearwhat is known with a little more certainty is that nvidia has orders in with tsmc for  technology that goes into ampere gpu cards according to kara copple writing for wepccom tsmc will be producingapple’s aapl  armbased processors and also amd’s ryzen  series of cpus it’s fair to say tsmc has some big projects on its handsand for tsmc to build any of this requires the sophisticated laser etching technology of asmli taped the video on wednesday morning before nvidia reported its latest quarterly results as i type now investors are reacting to stunning growth in the companys two primary segmentsgaming revenue of  billion was up  from a year ago datacenter revenue of  billion was up  from this time last yearthey even got a boost from crypto mining as they offer that niche market new specialized gpus for massively parallel highspeed processing more importantly current  revenue guidance at  billion was more than  higher than the analyst consensus of  that has investment banks jumping over each other to raise price targets north of after nvidias showstopping annual gpu tech conference held virtually in april i wrote about my own  pt on nvda and how datacenter was on pace to overtake gaming this year heres what i wrote thenjefferies semiconductor analyst mark lipacis wrote a powerful research report in september that the former is growing at  cagr vs just  for the latterbased on that math this is the year that datacenter takes over gaming in revenues and based on his  projections lipacis sees gaming growing to a nearly  billion business while dc blows the doors off to  billionfor perspective this years total revenue is only expected to be in the neighborhood of  billionto be clear lipacis was inspired to write this new report after nvidia announced it had an agreement to buy ukbased arm holdings for  billion that deal remains controversial  for everyone but nvda  and also uncertain in terms of the probability of actually closing any time soonthe primary issues revolve around arms technology for mobile devices which is licensed to everyone from apple to qualcommarm also deals in cpus serial processing which is part of what made it attractive to nvidias gpu parallel processing expertise but one of the most important elements to keep in mind when talking about jensen huang  co is that he surrounds himself with the best engineering talent in the world just like elonand thats why they develop complete stacks of hardware and software in the cuda platform to give power tools to data miners and modelers automation innovators and scientific researchers expanding the limits of our knowledge and technology in medicine energy aerospace materials autos and smart citiesgilder on the nanocosmi mentioned that my asml article has details on the new  largest investor the video actually has a good screenshot of the top tenbut i also want to share why george gilder is a new buyer of asml shares which have more than doubled in the past year from  to over  ill let him explain in his own wordswithout taiwan semiconductors and crucially asml your iphone   processor chip would not exist without asml tsm would not be able to make huaweis  hisilicon processors the same is true for samsung and your galaxy phoneasml is the key asmls technical lead in the field is so great and growing that it has essentially  market share of the photolithography market for singledigitnanometer geometriesthe semi ecosystem is a complex jungle as complicated as nvidias proposed acquisition of arm may be they also contract with the other big asian chip foundry samsung to spread out their risk away from tsmc  and maybe to avoid any technology ip slipping into view of applefor this jungle it pays to pay attention to a wily and brilliant veteran like gilder who knows that a premier arms dealer like asml and its invisible technologies may be one of the smartest bets of all be sure to check out my asml article to learn about
