new york may   prnewswire  bitcoin and nonfungible tokens nfts stocks are moving mostly in lockstep not because the two are the same but because they are new technologies and emerging markets that speak loudly to the digital revolution in fact outside sharing blockchain technology as the decentralized digital ledger storing data for security and authentication bitcoin and nft are quite distinct by definition nfts are not interchangeable with other tokens hence the term nonfungible whereas a bitcoin can be equally traded for any other bitcoin without distinction while bitcoin will only be a digital currency nfts are more versatile as they can represent anything digital that includes rights to music royalties as is the business model of music defi pioneer band royalty profile whose innovation involves structuring nfts as an access point to a number of different royalties from its constantly growing library of soundtracks other common threads between cryptocurrencies and nfts

infographic of the band royalty editorialwhere bitcoin goes nfts will followso why do nfts move along with bitcoin when so differentiated from the quintessential cryptocurrency its not just because of fomo fear of missing out because nfts started exploding on the scene this year headlined by christies auctioning a collection of beeples digital artwork for  million in march apropos not counting the beeple auction or nearly half a billion dollars in sales of nba video highlights known as nba top shots nft sales exceeded  billion in   up  from  million in  it is also because nfts are part of the complex encryption network of the ethereum eth blockchain and often paid for in cryptocurrency with pricing in eth there is a case to be made that nfts value can fluctuate with the crypto although those that see nfts like a collectible as a store of value would disagree much like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies nfts can be held sold or traded so their value fluctuates based on what the market indicates on any given dayto date the collectible space has been the primary attention draw but the breadth of the market is starting to push through including the music industry joining the mix on march  music business worldwide reported that nfts grossed  million for the music industry in the last  days including mike shinoda from linkoln park raking in  with his new single happy

business while building an extensive insider network that he brings to the companya first for retail investorsas it stands right now retail investors wanting exposure to the music industry dont have many options they can either buy stock in a public music label invest in funds that buy and sell music royalties or pursue royalties themselves through websites that auction royalty rights which typically are beyond the price range of an average person in what many perceive as a groundfloor opportunity band royalty is changing the landscape — not to mention making it more exciting — by making it accessible for retail investors to participate by owning nftsearlier this month following its private sale of music nfts which generated almost  million band launched its nft sales platform on its website creating the first music nftonly platform this was accomplished by opening access to the first series of  band nfts on its platform staggering the release based on rarity the companys plan is to keep the nft count tight much like other popular nft projects such as cryptopunks and hashmasks both of which have had secondary market sales in the millions of dollars the longterm intention is to have a maximum of  band nfts across four different series to be released over the next  monthsupon purchasing a band nft an investor can trade it or hold it just like any other cryptocurrency or they can stake it following band kyc protocols staking means that the investor has a chance to participate in the revenues from one of three music royalty pools print music royalties mechanical and public performance royalties or synchronization royalties most likely with their share being paid out in the upcoming band token staking can be for different time periods ranging from  days up to five yearsthis charttopper just started playingas explained by andersun on the nifty show podcast the vision of the company is starting to be realized the first series of nfts are now launched and the requisite smart contracts that facilitate staking are expected to be completed this quarter staking transactions are a milestone for the company as the catalyst for revenues the goal is to allow band nft stakers the ability to share in different streams of income including  from all band royalty music catalog revenue a percentage from any auctions of single band music tracks sold  on any band nfts traded in the secondary market on opensea or the band platform and  from reselling of music royalties on the band platformthe strategy includes assembling a robust music royalty ecosystem complete with a launchpad for emerging artists currently musicians are at the mercy of longheld standards of the music industry a process that band intends to demonstrably disrupt with a new platform that provides artists with creative ways to earn and keep royalties while better connecting with fansupending the normthe music industry has been looking for a paradigm shift back in favor of artists ever since internet and streaming music rang a death knell for terrestrial radio the irony is that where technology once put artists in a hurt locker it now may pave the pathway to prosperity once again
