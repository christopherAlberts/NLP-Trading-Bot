having covered cash management and treasury indepth at cfo for years i’ve been astounded by the statements of companies investing slices of their cash reserves in bitcoin some business media outlets too suggest it makes perfect sense for a vp of treasury to take shortterm cash residing in money market funds or timebearing deposits and buy units of the cryptocurrencyin “holding bitcoin still risky” we note why unless a company expects cash inflows and outflows in bitcoin it would be a highly speculative unsafe investment as marwan forzley ceo of veem told our reporter “while bitcoin’s price has gone up substantially we have also seen significant drops that can produce quite a bit of losses”stop right there principal preservation is the sine qua non of shortterm cash management lose more than a few million dollars of the cash to be spent on capital projects or sit on the balance sheet as a safety net and you’ll be shown the doorwe are more than a decade past the financial crisis but i guess the freezing of the auctionrate securities ars market in  has been forgotten holding those debt instruments — which had a longterm nominal maturity but had an interest rate that regularly reset through a dutch auction — ultimately caused millions of dollars of corporate cash writedowns banks lost too — corporate clients sued them for marketing arss as safe highly liquid and cashequivalent securitiesbitcoin may be liquid but it is far from safe and the accounting is muddled despite being traded in an active market bitcoin is still considered an intangible asset what’s more the financial accounting standards board is in no hurry to set any new standards for it says new fasb chair richard jonesi fear the bitcoin tribe will pressure treasurers and finance chiefs to allot some portion of their shortterm cash to bitcoin but finance executives shouldn’t be swayed by faulty arguments such as that bitcoin is an effective hedge against inflation based on no intrinsic value bitcoin’s price does not correlate with any asset prices or movements in inflation rates so how can an investor structure a hedge with itthe arguments for holding bitcoin ignore market realities and financial management principles only if a finance executive is ok with that should they consider adding cryptocurrency to a portfoliothis opinion piece originally appeared in the aprilmay  print version of cfo
