investors take a breather if you’re watching daily price moves probably not anytime soon but here’s what to know about bitcoin’s volatility and how to handle itwhy does bitcoin’s price drop so fastvolatility is nothing new to wall street but when a price can jump more than  in one month or lose half its value in just two days it may make you wonder what’s driving these huge swingsof course stocks can also be volatile but their value is tied to something somewhat concrete how a company will do in the future there are ways to check up on how the company is doing like studying quarterly earnings reports or checking to see how well a company’s products are selling in storesgold is different sure gold has some value from its use in producing jewelry and electronics but mostly its value is derived from the expectation that you’ll be able to sell it in the future in this sense bitcoin is more like gold says hanna halaburda an associate professor at nyu stern school of business people buy it because they think the price will increase in the future but that makes it a speculative asset and more susceptible to volatility since something as small as a skeptical tweet can lead to doubt and maybe spark a selling frenzy“you only chase expectations” halaburda says “this is just holding a crystal ball and trying to figure out what the future will bring”bitcoin is also still pretty new having only been around since  the market is still searching for an equilibrium price some people think the cryptocurrency is underpriced some think it’s overpriced when americans were legally allowed to start owning gold in the  gold’s price was also highly volatilekeep in mind that stock market crashes tend to be preceded by periods of extreme volatility which is why wall street calls the cboe

clear if the dynamics are different when it comes to cryptocurrency — but it’s something for investors to keep in mind when determining how much of their portfolio to allocate to bitcoinads by money
