idealistic computer programmers plotted the downfall of the world’s financial system their plans centred around bitcointhe cryptocurrency developed five years earlier could be stored and spent anonymously and could be minted without interference from the watchful eyes of government when the  bitcoin squat was raided  bitcoin btc was worth around  today  btc is worth around  – an increase of  per cent in february this year bitcoin hit a market capitalisation of  after a  per cent rally in  a report released last month by citigroup conceded that “large swathes of the traditional banking and financial markets view bitcoin as a completely valueless asset” and quoted the economist nouriel roubini as saying “the flintstones had a better monetary system”but the report went on to say that bitcoin is “recognised as a source of ‘digital gold’” largely due to its builtin scarcity – a finite number of bitcoins is written into the cryptocurrency’s code – and that it could one day become “the cujprrency of choice for international trade” some including former bank of england governor mark carney have speculated that a digital currency like bitcoin could one day become the global reserve currency replacing the us dollar as governments around the world announce colossal spending packages in the wake of  and with historic low interest rates looking set to remain part of any “new normal” the report notes that “concerns about future possible inflationary pressures” for traditional currencies are giving extra impetus to the bull market for bitcoininstitutional investors have started making forays into bitcoin according to investment bank jp morgan the bank has said that if wild price fluctuations such as those seen over the past decade were to slow this would improve bitcoin’s efficacy as a safe store of value much more akin to the touted “digital gold” and could see the price of  btc rise to  this week shares in coinbase a cryptocurrency exchange platform

metachallenge of economic freedomread more coinbase ipo like it or not you’re now invested in bitcoinbut not everyone is convinced “no scheme like this in history has ever lasted forever without either just blowing up or some kind of legal party taking action” says martin walker who as well being director of banking and finance at the center for evidencebased management a nonprofit is a major sceptic the thing about cryptocurrencies he says “is that unlike almost any other kind of financial asset they do not generate any return they don’t pay a coupon like a bond they don’t pay a dividend like a share they don’t give you any ownership rights on anything and you can’t really spend them anywhere”why buy them “the only reason is if you think the price will keep going up” he says in other words bitcoin is little more than a speculative assetdespite the leftwing radicalism of the bitcoin squatters much of the early interest in cryptocurrency was generated by followers of what walker describes as “right libertarian philosophy” david golumbia a professor of digital studies at virginia commonwealth university has written extensively on the links between bitcoin and “far right political thought” and nick land a leading proponent of “dark enlightenment” philosophy on the altright is a bitcoin enthusiastdue to the anonymity afforded by cryptocurrencies which don’t have to be stored in traditional bank accounts linked to names and addresses with official identification regulatory oversight and “know your customer” policies bitcoin grew in popularity as a means of buying illegal products on the “dark web” including drugs guns and child pornography in  when the fbi shut down the black market website silk road the price of bitcoin collapsed even today its use as a means of payment for legal products is extremely rare bitcoin has also been adopted by criminal groups as a way of evading taxes and laundering money when an anonymous “dark wallet” for bitcoin was first developed a blog supporting islamic state hailed it as “simple” and “easy” and asked “allah to hasten it’s  usage for us”bitcoin was developed in  by an unknown coder using the pseudonym satoshi nakamoto it was to be a “decentralised” digital currency unshackled from stateowned banks like the fed the bank of england or the european central bank at the time these three institutions and others like them were dealing with the fallout from the collapse of the us subprime mortgage market and the largest financial crisis since the great depression soon they would fight the fire of insolvency through the creation of billions of dollars in new money used to purchase bonds and financial assets in a process known as quantitative easingin a nod to the chaotic circumstances in which bitcoin was born nakamoto inserted a copied message a headline from the times into the code of the original bitcoin block “the times  chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” instead of relying on this failed system of boom bust and bailouts bitcoin would use “blockchain” technology to create a public “distributed ledger” – a record of all the bitcoin trades and transactions that had taken place and all the bitcoins that had been created this “distributed ledger” would be accessible to all and it not only facilitated quick transfers of bitcoin from one “digital wallet” to another without the intermediaries of the traditional banking system but also made bitcoin impossible to forge or replicate the “distributed ledger” of bitcoin transactions would be maintained through the process of “mining” or creating new bitcoins using computing power to make complex mathematical calculations to keep the blockchain up to datewritten into bitcoin’s code was the proviso that its numbers would be kept finite unlike in the old discredited world of fiat currencies with central banks able to issue freefloating pounds and dollars ad infinitum no more than  million bitcoins will ever be mined while there are currently around  million in circulation it’ll take until  for the full amount to be created it is this “digital scarcity” engineered into the product that has led to comparisons including in the citigroup report with gold its limited supply like the precious metal means it is “insulated from inflation rates” and the ultralow interest rate monetary policy pursued by central banks for a postcovid recoveryread more facebook and the great crypto conthe vision of many of the early users of bitcoin was for a currency that didn’t bow to the whims of the global banking and financial system “a lot of people have an alternative view of the world – and a lot think that because capitalism is bad bitcoin is great” says walker “but no with bitcoin you’ve taken the worst bits of capitalism concentrated it in one thing and totally divorced it from anything real”an ecosystem of cryptocurrencies and blockchainbased products has grown alongside bitcoin in january the price of dogecoin a cryptocurrency that takes inspiration from the doge internet meme rose by  per cent in  hours after it was promoted via twitter by the rapper snoop dogg and tesla’s founder elon musk another coinye released in  was sued by kanye west when it used his image without permission it is alleged too that cryptocurrency tether a socalled “stablecoin” which claimed to be backed by real us dollars has been used to pump the price of bitcoinperhaps most bafflingly the current crypto boom has exploded in tandem with the market for nonfungible tokens nfts – unique digital codes also built using blockchain technology that cannot be copied or forged and are often linked to digital artwork or music at the beginning of march auction house christie’s sold a computergenerated collage image linked to an nft for £ making the image’s creator beeple one of the top three most valuable living artists alongside jeff koons and david hockney“people just keep pumping the price up” says walker and the story is the same across all crypto assets all blockchainbased technologies from cryptocurrencies to the burgeoning market in art made up of noughts and ones on a server “just think” walker continues “if bitcoin stabilises at  people will say ‘hurray it’s worth ’ but if the price stops moving no new money comes in that means there’s no new money to pay for the bitcoin miners who have billions of dollars in expenses every year there’s no profit for anyone at all if the price is stable so they have to keep pumping”as policymakers experiment with monetary and fiscal policy to stave off a postcovid recession bitcoin and cryptocurrencies may well continue their volatile journeys as finite inflationresistant assets at the centre of a speculative bubble of historic proportions while the crypto market remains unpredictable what is certain is that these digital products have come a long way from the world of anticapitalist hacktivism and soho squatsthis article originally appeared in
