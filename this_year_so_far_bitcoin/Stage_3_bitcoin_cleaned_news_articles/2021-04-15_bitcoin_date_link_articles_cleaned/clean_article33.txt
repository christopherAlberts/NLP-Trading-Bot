soulless patrick bateman ghoul apartments in canary wharfwith bitcoin hitting another alltimehigh on wednesday of just over £ per “btc” you’re probably wondering how you can get in on the cryptocurrency boom but wait before you buy a “shitcoin” because you like the picture of the astronaut on its logo let’s take a step back there are more than  cryptocurrencies out there – and none are born equalsome have real life uses like hedging against inflation or transferring large amounts of money others are incredibly speculative or essentially just memes here i’m going to give you a primer on four of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market importantly though this is just that a primer before you even start to think about exchanging any cash for crypto do your research look at a coin’s fundamentals get to grips with technical analysis don’t just jump in twofooted because some twitter guru told you toi look forward to hearing from you a month from now when you’ve given yourself a stress migraine from trying to understand the minutiae of how a blockchain works for now here are those coinsbitcoinwhat is it bitcoin is a form of decentralised digital cash meaning it’s not controlled by a central bank or authority instead it’s run by thousands of computers around the world launched in  the world’s first ever cryptocurrency was presented as an alternative financial system after the economic crisiswhat does it do bitcoin’s main function is to send money anywhere in the world without going through a bank or a third party meaning large transactions that would usually take days can be sent in less time than it takes to microwave a pizzaadvertisementwhile governments keep printing cash to keep their economies afloat bitcoin believers say the scarcity of the coin makes it a hedge against inflation compared to physical money there are – and will only ever be –  million bitcoins in existence having fewer coins in circulation theoretically means those coins will have more value hence bitcoin being nicknamed “digital gold”ethereumwhat is it ether or eth is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap behind bitcoin like its older brother this coin allows users to transfer digital money and can be used to store wealthso how is it different let’s talk about blockchains these are sophisticated decentralised databases which store transactions and are immutable meaning they can’t be messed around with ethereum is a blockchainbased software platform and ether is its currencywhat does it do ethereum is programmable meaning you can build apps on its ecosystem think of it like the foundations of a house once the ground has been reinforced you can build all sorts of structures on topright now there are hundreds of apps available on the ethereum network also known as dapps – or decentralised applications – these include marketplaces to buy and sell digital art known as nfts cloud storage solutions and music streaming services compared to iphone and android apps the operation of dapps are completely transparent because their data is stored on the blockchain which is accessible to anyone and everyoneether the cryptocurrency helps to fuel the operation of the ethereum networkdogecoinwhat is it remember the meme of a stonedlooking shiba inu that’s where dogecoin gets it name fromwhat does it do unlike other cryptocurrencies

hoskins cardano’s fans say it’s more sophisticated than its competitorslike ethereum cardano is programmable the difference however is that cardano is a few steps behind and there are currently very few apps available on their blockchain to some this is a positive – there’s room to grow and to build on mistakes that other blockchains may have madeada the cryptocurrency that runs the cardano network is also currently much cheaper than ether earlier this year kiss frontman gene simmons announced he bought  worth so there’s thatshitcoins and all the restthere are literally thousands of coins out there some have real world uses – binance coin the fourth most popular cryptocurrency at the time of writing is used for buying other cryptocurrencies on the binance trading platform while tether another popular coin is pegged to the price of the us dollarothers are what those in the crypto community refer to as “shitcoins”these are characterised by shortterm price rises and steep dips
