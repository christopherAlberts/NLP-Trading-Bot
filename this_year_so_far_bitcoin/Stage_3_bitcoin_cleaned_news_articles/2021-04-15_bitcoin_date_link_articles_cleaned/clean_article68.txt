project smartbch as the community has been very excited about this new venture smartbch aims to connect ethereum’s evm and  apis to a smart sidechain built using the bitcoin cash network on april   smartbch’s lead developer wang kui was interviewed by satoshi’s angels’ cofounder cindy wang and he explained the many benefits smartbch will bring to the crypto ecosystemsmartbch maximizing tps with bitcoin cashthere are many reasons why people are bullish about bitcoin cash bch as the digital asset has been processing more transactions per day than btc since february moreover proponents like internet entrepreneur kim dotcom has been telling the world about the many benefits bch has to offer dotcom plans to leverage bch for his content monetization application kim furthermore bch supporters have been excited about the decentralized finance defi project anyhedge and the noncustodial platform detokenbut a new announcement in recent times has bch fans talking about a sidechain that will connect with ethereum in a very inexpensive fashion because it leverages the bitcoin cash bch blockchain the smart bitcoin cash project or smartbch is a unique ethereum and  sidechain that plans to make throughput as large as one billion gas every  seconds this week the project’s lead engineer wang kui discussed the smartbch project with cindy wang a cofounder of satoshi’s angels as well as a crypto educator and writerwang kui says that the smartbch project came together organically and since  he’s been working on methods to maximize tps transactions per second by the second half of  wang kui said he figured out a way to maximize tps and after discussing the solution with colleagues they “decided to deliver  research results by launching smartbch” the reason bitcoin cash bch was chosen is because of the block size capacity and the network’s alignment with satoshi’s vision“the main reason for choosing  is that it is featured with big blocks” wang kui emphasized “based on my professional background and work experience i think optimization measures should be taken to give full play to the ability of the computing system itself in english we call it ‘brute force’ but ethereum prefers ‘subtle’ ways like sharding  i’m a big supporter of  and i think it is most in line with the original vision of satoshi which is to ‘serve as many people as possible’” the developer insisteddecentralization one of the major advantages of bitcoin cashrumor has it that bitmain’s jihan wu has some ties to the project but wang kui stressed that smartbch is more of a community endeavor“you can say binance smart chain bsc belongs to cz or binance but you can’t say smartbch belongs to jihan wu or matrixport” wang kui said to the satoshi’s angels’ cofounder “eventually i would like smartbch to be a project for the entire bch community at the moment it is still very small and a lot of technical decisions depend on my own decisions this is natural as well as linus torvalds made decisions in the early days of linux”cindy wang also asked wang kui about the advantages of running decentralized finance projects and nonfungible token nft asset solutions using bitcoin cash bch“there are two major advantages ” wang kui remarked “one is that  is completely decentralized for those who believe in decentralization i don’t think they want their nft works to have a tight connection with certain companies the other is high tps smartbch didn’t simply fork from ethereum as heco and bsc did they offer cheap gas fees at the early stage but as transactions increase or token price grows they will end up with high fees like ethereum” wang kui addedthe smartbch lead developer further saidthis won’t happen to smartbch when traffic grows we will use optimization software in a ‘brute force’style to achieve ‘high transactions but low fees’ ethereum seeks to solve high gas fees in subtle ways like sharding and rollups but i believe a single chain could make high performance with better operability interaction and user experiencethe satoshi’s angels’ cofounder also asked the smartbch developer if the team felt pressured by the expectations the bch community may have about the project wang kui said “a little bit” but to him and the smartbch team “it’s not about worrying about my personal fame” “it’s more about how we received a lot of warmhearted help from the community and we don’t want to disappoint them” the developer concludedafter the project launched users were able to start a single node private testnet moreover software developer josh ellithorpe had shown the bch community how he connected smartbch to the popular metamask wallet a great number of bch supporters see massive potential in the smartbch project and it’s been a trending topic in recent times
