in the past  months bitcoin has surged by more than six times while ethereum has skyrocketed by almost  times which is a better investment nowwith bitcoin racing ahead more than six times to almost  wednesday from approximately  a year ago and ether the currency built on the ethereum platform but whose name is often used interchangeably rising to more than  from roughly  in the same time frame investors may be wondering which is the better bet going forward“i think the upside on ethereum over the next  months is greater than the upside on bitcoin because of the price and where it can go” steve ehrlich ceo and cofounder of cryptoasset broker voyager digital told thestreet adding “in the crypto world there is a propensity to look at lower dollar coins as the increase can be much greater in a shorter period of time”he noted while he doesn’t give investment advice he believes the upside on ethereum tends to be a little bit greater from a pure percentage standpointjim cramer says he would absolutely take compensation in bitcoinindeed ryan watkins a senior research analyst at crypto research firm messari said he expects ethereum to reach between  to  per coin by the end of the year a fourfold increase at the high end from its recent levelsin comparison he expects bitcoin to rise as high as  times its recent level to  by the end of the year said watkins who tagged bitcoin’s range between  to  at the close of the yearmeanwhile voyager digital’s customers all of whom own some bitcoin and ether have shifted their cryptocurrency allocations in the past four months to enlarge their ether holdings ehrlich said previously voyager’s customers held about five to six times more bitcoin than ether but since the start of the year that ratio has dropped to about four times he noted“nfts and the other projects being written on the ethereum protocol may be driving this shift people believe there’s an opportunity and some people think ethereum will outperform bitcoin” ehrlich said “i think we’re also seeing our larger investors being able to take on  risk and risk profile”bitcoin balance sheets tesla up over  billion on bitcoin purchasebitcoin in comparison to ethereum is considered a more stable investment and the metrics to measure its value are considered more welldefined because it is often compared to gold which has established ways for investors to assess its value said watkins who noted he does not give investment adviceethereum is considered to be riskier than bitcoin in general because it’s more volatile and has lower retail and institutional adoption ehrlich saidis bitcoin overvalueddespite more than doubling since the start of the year when it traded at roughly  some still don’t consider bitcoin overvalued“i personally don’t think so i think right now it’s about  of the market cap of gold so from an adoption standpoint it is still very early there are increasing amounts of institutions owning it but it’s still not a significant part of people’s portfolios” said watkinswhere do bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies go from herewhen it comes to valuing bitcoin ethereum and other cryptocurrencies it’s best to avoid comparing them against each other because bitcoin and ethereum have different use cases watkins and ehrlich said“bitcoin is kind of like a pet rock that just sits there and doesn’t do anything it’s very slow and inefficient and really the only thing that the bitcoin blockchain is good for storing value and facilitating highvalue transactions but thats fine because thats all it needs to be its just a hypersecure blockchain for storing and transferring bitcoin” watkins said “ethereum can host a variety of different assets not just its own native assets it has all these different applications being built on top of it from an investor perspective it just kind of bootstraps its own economy and the asset ether is at the center of it”growth catalysts for corporate endorsement of cryptocurrencies by the likes of tesla square goldman sachs and others helped propel bitcoin higher in the first few months of  as did fears of inflation that sent some investors turning to bitcoin as a hedge against inflation said both watkins and ehrlichbitcoin etfs when they come out and what you need to knowpotential bitcoin drivers for the rest of the year include coinbase’s ipo and other cryptocurrency ipos continued institutional adoption of bitcoin and strong expectations that a usbased bitcoin etf may soon emerge watkins notedfor ethereum the hyper demand for nfts and other projects built on the network helped drive demand at the start of the year and are expected to carry it through the rest of “ethereum has many kinds of narratives to help drive that story” watkins saidamong them he pointed to decentralized finance defi which is primarily built on ethereum and is taking off because it allows users to trade assets and borrow and lend money directly with one another without involving bankscontinued demand for nfts and two upcoming ethereum upgrades are expected to drive further demand for ethereum in  watkins added the  upgrade which is designed to change the way users bid for block space is expected to come online in july while ethereum  which will merge with ethereum  at the end of the year aims to make the block chain’s infrastructure run faster and handle more transactionscrypto investor how i accidentally sold my first nftone big riskdespite a number of catalysts that could potentially drive ethereum and bitcoin higher this year watkins offers this word of caution  macroeconomic conditions“when people are taking risk off the table whether it’s because of treasury yields rising or whatever else that has an effect on the crypto markets” watkins said “if it gets to the point where equities start to get a bit shaky like they did a month ago that’s not going to be good for the crypto markets as well we could definitely see a   or  correction”
