cryptocurrency especially the largest bitcoin is often touted as new gold a way of holding wealth independent of banks i discussed cryptocurrency briefly a few years ago cash plastic or bitcoin may   when i compared explaining bitcoin to the challenge faced by marco polo when he tried to tell  century venetian city fathers about the paper money fiat he had seen in china heres my marco polo explanation of bitcoinwhat is bitcoin• a decentralized peertopeer electronic cash system unlike fiat let it be done money such as dollars where a central authority — in this case the us government — promises that pieces of green paper without any intrinsic value are in fact valuable• a monetary system immune from inflation since there will never be more than  million bitcoins unlike fiat money which can be printed and hence devalued according to the whim of the government• digital currency in the same way your credit card represents digital currency except without any middleman or central authority like visa or your bank or the federal reserve• a democratic payment system that offers a way for the nearly  billion unbanked people in the world to enter the economy and easily trade services and goods• the financial equivalent of email• a ledger aka blockchain containing the entire history of bitcoin transactionswhat do you mean ledger bitcoins ledger is the record of all transactions since its inception in  the ledger is anonymous decentralized and transparent with thousands of identical copies maintained and constantly updated by a global network of nodes it can only be added to not edited the ledger is broken down into blocks each block containing the record of approximately  new transactions together with proof or hash see below of the previous block hence the bitcoin ledger is also called the blockchainhow does it work new transactions are constantly added to the blockchain at an average rate of one block every  minutes to verify that a new block is a legitimate record socalled miners essentially engage in a lottery searching by trialanderror using powerful custombuilt computers for the correct nonce the number that will return a singularly unlikely result once found the winning miner broadcasts it to thousands of rival nodes for validation resulting in the newly verified block being added to the chain the miners effort or proof of work is rewarded with  bitcoins per block currently about  the reward is halved every four yearswhats a singularly unlikely result an arithmetical process an algorithm known as  is applied to the  new transactions plus the hash of the previous block plus the nonce being checked the output hash is a run of  hexadecimal base  numbers a miner knows theyve hit the jackpot when their hash starts with a certain number of zeros currently  that number selfadjusts to keep the mining rate steady the more miners the greater difficulty to give some idea whats involved the challenge with  initial zeros is equivalent to finding a particular grain of sand out of all the grains of sand in the world about whats the point of miners thousands of miners around the world validate transactions and keep the blockchain secure by consensus verifying everyone elses ledger for discrepancies or fraud about every  minutes instead of a central authority thousands of individuals are guaranteeing the integrity of the systembarry evans  believes bitcoin is one of the most important inventions of our time
