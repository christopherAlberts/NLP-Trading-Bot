why blockchain with bitcoin and nfts is a good thingimage taken from investopediacom kiran mathur mohammedas the rich world gradually becomes less religious with the developing world soon to follow something is rushing in to fill the void enter blockchain and its bitcoin and nonfungible tokensas much as i’ve always respected the undeniably impressive technology behind it the evangelical zeal reverent voices and glints in the eye of blockchain adherents is mildly alarming to say the leastafter all this technology is simply a way of recording entries in an online ledger that splits up the record between lots of different computers complicated codes cryptography ensure that only the people who are meant to be adding to or editing the record can do so since the record is all split up no one person can change it easilyclever to be sure but worthy of the fervour it has inspiredthe latest craze is nonfungible tokens – unique digital files that cannot be replicated nfts have rocketed into prominence or notoriety depending on who you talk to in the art world since the recent sale of one of instagram artist beeple’s work for  million – just for a digital image that can be viewed by anyonesounds mad but is it any more absurd than any of the other beliefs that underpin modern societyis a strong belief that a selflimiting online ledger is an excellent store of value any different from the immense value we currently ascribe to such varied objects as lumps of shiny yellow metal sparkling rocks or daubs of paint on some stretched canvasthere is no coincidence that gold and art are the two markets to be the first to be disrupted by blockchain that is because they are opaque and rely heavily on trust and belief in the case of the former blockchain provides a way to verify the authenticity and provenance of a piece establish rarity the “nonfungible” bit of nft and in the case of the latter a way to limit supply of a digital token except in a more convenient and assured way than mining goldunderlying the value of gold and art is little more than faith in the case of art it is nurtured by the doctrines of the high priests of art curation legitimising each piece with every exhibition ritual and critical paper talmudic textwhat will blockchain do to art the art world will be forced to become more transparent and more democratic art will perhaps more closely resemble popular music or film now that is not necessarily a good thing – there may well be a period of anarchy with lots of very expensive bad art for some time but demand for highquality curated content will not go away disruption will invigorate artists and curatorsstrong belief from early adopters is fuelling the shift we discount this to our peril both nfts as well as a basket of cryptocurrencies which will become more stable as they age subject to distortions of government regulation and are here to stayas i’ve written before according to nobel prizewinning economist kenneth arrow almost every economic action is underpinned by trust or lack thereof if you can verify a transaction or an agreement you can trust that it will be carried out it therefore has value and can be traded blockchain can therefore increase the supply of trust in the world increasing economic growthif one is to especially lean on the side of optimism i’d argue that blockchain can help us become better behaved if you know your action will be likely to be recorded in an immutable chain you’re less likely to try to cheat or break a contracthow does this affect people like us well technology like this is even more necessary in the developing world where there is less trust tt for example ranks  out of  countries in contract enforcement according to the world bankblockchain has a use case wherever some form of verification is required – which is necessary for almost any transaction from transferring a title deed to onboarding a new customer to ensuring a contract can be easily entered and enforced into without requiring very expensive lawyersby becoming early adopters developing countries like ours have the rare opportunity to ride this wave of growth and leapfrog developed nations by rapidly adopting appropriate blockchain solutionstry squeezing that on a placardkiran mathur mohammed is an economist and cofounder of medl an idb labbacked social impact health tech companykmmpubgmailcom
