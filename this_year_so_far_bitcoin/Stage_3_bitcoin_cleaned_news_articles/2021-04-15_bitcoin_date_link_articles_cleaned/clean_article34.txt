cairo — the bitcoin price has shot up to unprecedented levelson april  the price of a bitcoin hit  up from  in early september  — an increase of  in just six months — and the cryptocurrency is expected to top  this yearin a march  statement the central bank of egypt warned egyptians against dealing in cryptocurrencies stressing that egypt works only with official currencies approved by the bank the statement explained that cryptocurrencies are subject to extreme fluctuation in value since they are not issued by central issuing authorities in any country and not backed by tangible assets such as gold reservesahmad shawqi soliman an economic researcher at the faculty of commerce of alazhar university in cairo said in televised statements on april  that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin may attract many egyptian investors with potentially lightning profits he warned that such investments could negatively affect interest in other types like direct investments stocks or real estate and threaten the stability of the egyptian economythere are no statistics available about the impact of egyptians’ demand on cryptocurrencies namely bitcoins on direct investments or investments in real estate the rise in the bitcoin however coincided with severe drops in the egyptian stock exchange which saw historical losses during the month of march the market lost about  billion egyptian pounds  billion declining by  from  billion egyptian pounds  billion to  billion pounds  billionlawyer ahmad mizar said in a televised interview back in february that the central bank’s repeated warnings to citizens to avoid cryptocurrencies are an effort to enforce the law which prohibits dealing in such currency without a licenseaccording to article  of the central bank and banking system law which entered into force in september  it is prohibited to issue trade in and promote cryptocurrencies to establish or operate platforms for its circulation without a license from the central bank’s board of directors those who violate the provisions of article  are punishable by prison or fines from one to  million egyptian pounds a bitcoin miner who preferred not to be named told almonitor that the central bank is unlikely to issue such licenses“the central bank’s recent statement confirms that the authorities reject cryptocurrencies they stopped a project to issue an egyptian digital currency under consideration” the source saidback in  the central bank began to explore creating an egyptian digital currency the bank’s team was expected to complete the study by  but no such achievement has been announcedthe miner criticized world governments policies on digital and cryptocurrencies“governments are fighting these currencies because they want to maintain control over bank transfers traditional currencies cash and banks customer data they want to keep controlling the exchange rate by  the printing of bills while keeping the reserves the same” he said“cryptocurrencies are designed using blockchain technology which does not allow even its designers to track their transfers identify their owners or to issue more currency or even to modify the algorithms that control their prices for instance there are only  million bitcoins available in the world and this number cannot be increased therefore supply and demand control the currency’s value without any interference from its makers or governments” the source explainedan economics professor at cairo university who asked not to be named told almonitor “the central bank of egypt warned against cryptocurrencies and not digital currencies in general the central bank and banking system law granted the central bank the right to issue and manage digital currencieshe went on “the cryptocurrency price does not reflect its true value in fact over the past two months the bitcoin price boomed when american businessman elon musk one of the wealthiest men in the world promoted bitcoins which increased the currency price this propaganda was what caused a surge in the bitcoin price something that could backfire if musk  stopped investing in bitcoins” he saidthe professor added that the “digital currencies the central bank was considering are designed to protect customer data these currencies will be managed through ewallets that will be an alternative to traditional banks establishing ewallets for such currencies may require identity verification but the details of the transactions and the value of balances will only be known to the holder of the accountwallet unlike traditional bank accounts whose balances and transactions are accessible to the banks’ staff”“transactions will be done through encrypted communications between users and such wallets such as paypal or payoneer” he notedthe professor stressed that digital wallets may be vulnerable to piracy unlike cryptocurrency platforms that are designed with blockchain technology however he believes that noncrypto digital currencies are more secure because piracy is a limited threat protection systems are constantly improving and because digital currencies will be backed by cash reserves at the central bank of egypt which will regulate its trading policies to avoid manipulation of demand and ensure that its price reflects its true value
