galaxy digitals mike novogratz explains the outlook for crypto as coinbase goes publicvideo transcriptmark decambre welcome im mark decambre markets editor at marketwatch and im joined here by mike novogratz founder and ceo of galaxy digital that was a great session with  and senator lummisjust before i get in we dont have a lot of time but i want to just address or remind folks that we encourage the audience to ask questions and put those questions in the chat box on the right side of your screen and well get to those as soon as possible and get to as many as we canbut let me just jump in mike coinbase is a publicly traded company its on the nasdaq its come a little bit off the boil give me the macro view of what you think of coin trading now and what this means for the industrymike novogratz so its a monumental day for the industry in a lot of way this is the netscape moment and for those a lot younger than me netscape was the big ipo in  that really ushered in the age of the internetand coinbase is direct listing today first of all it was the single largest transfer of value in one price i think of all time like  billion transferred right it is ushering in a new era where the crypto economy is an asset classand thats exciting for everyone who has toiled away in this space for the last seven eight years and so or the last  years quite frankly and so big big day for cryptomark decambre you make anything of the share price actually coming a little bit off of its peak of the daymike novogratz no listen you know when you have that kind of excitement you had  billion in one print people that have been at long coinbase from  million i tried to beg my way into that company at  million and i wasnt able to get money inbut a billion  billion  billion  billion of course theyre going to take some profit today to balance out their portfolios to ring the cash register and so im sure theres going to be twoway volatility for the next few weeksstory continuesbut im also sure that every big mutual fund every big institution that plays in the equity space who needs crypto exposure now is going to see coinbase as part of that exposure and it is the marquee name in our space right now im hoping one day galaxy sits right alongside it as the second marquee name but there havent been a lot of great crypto offeringsmark decambre which is a good followon question galaxy digital is public in canada why did you go public there and when are you going to list in the us when and if are you going to list in the usmike novogratz yes so im not allowed to talk about that for lots of legal reasons at our last earnings we said second half of the year is our ideamark decambre all right so let me ask you another question that you may not be able you may or may not be able to talk about but from what weve seen in terms of reports galaxy digital also filed with a bunch of the other wannabes out there who filed for a bitcoin etf application with the sec you know how are you thinking about thatmike novogratz listenmark decambre and if you cant speak to that can you speak broadlymike novogratz let me speak more broadly to the etf there are  companies that have filed i think  to do to have an etf this year my sense is we will have an etf by the end of the year and when the sec rules everyone will get a fair shot to launch their etfi think they will do a blanket approval process i dont think theyre going to pick one person versus the next thats my sense i dont know that as a fact but its a pretty strong sensemark decambre so you think it will be a jump ballmike novogratz jump ball so its going to be you know whos charismatic in their orange jacket whos got a big brand who has great distribution who connects to the investor basemark decambre yeah i guess its probably worth telling people youre wearing bitcoin orangemike novogratz this is bitcoin orange in honor of coinbase you know fred ehrsam brian armstrong deserve a big round of applausemark decambre so in the backdrop of coinbase going public we just heard from federal reserve chairman jerome powell who just described crypto as vehicles for speculation at the economic club of washington what do you say to thatmike novogratz listen i think sometimes you can miss the point you know coinbase isnt a fintech company its a crypto economy company right its an ecosystem company you see this rise in nfts were using blockchain now for ip blockchain for digital art blockchain for music opening up whole new ways that artists can connectin the financial sector bitcoin has become digital gold it is now   of gold today the chairman of goldman sachs david solomon said he will be surprised if it doesnt surpass gold in market cap and so that lane is an important lane right in some ways its a report card on how chairman powell and janet yellen are doing managing the economypeople are buying bitcoin because fiats being debased but theres other parts of the crypto ecosystem that are exploding right the ethereum project the ethereum network everything is building being built on top of it central bank issued digital currencies including the us digital currency right facebook is coming out with dm very soonwe have usdc that circle and coinbase have done thats going to be a big battle in payments and its an important one because the chinese are doing this and so were going to have this kind of geopolitical war to see who becomes the global digital currencyand so when you put it all together our ecosystem has an exploding tam right whats the total addressable market its almost hard to identify because there are so many different ways blockchain crypto bitcoin put it all together is going to impact our lives in the futuremark decambre so it is hard to envision what the future is going to look like but weve got you know i guess news as well that gary gensler has been confirmed as the new sec commissioner being a goldman alum i imagine you know a little bit about him ive already worked with him in hong kong what do you expect from himmike novogratz i do know gary gary is very smart he loves crypto he taught a class at mit on blockchain bitcoin i actually was a guest lecturer at his class and so unlike chairman clayton who just didnt want to deal with that as part of his legacy i am certain gensler is going to tackle these issues and help get some clarity a regulatory clarity around what participants should be expectinghes already said bitcoin and ethereum are not securities and so thats great news you know hes a progressive at his core and so i think if im a bank and im a big renttaker im probably a little bit nervous but the crypto ethos is to go after the renttakers and so quite frankly crypto aligns with gensler in a really straight waymark decambre now you know i think we talked when weve had conversations in the past about this notion you even touched on a little bit about crypto and blockchain eating eating the world what do you mean by thatmike novogratz so listen were early stages but a blockchain is a database and its a database that can be shared by lots of people and authenticated and never changed and so you can take that technology to art were seeing that within nfts now and say hey i can create digitally scarce art and i know its authentic and so its going to open up creativityyou can also take it to finance right there are companies like sushiswap and uniswap out there which are exchanges theyre decentralized exchanges and so i can envision a future where the nasdaq and the cme and the new york stock exchange are less important because people want peertopeer exchangeand you cut out all the people right think about a driverless bank or a driverless car or driverless exchange there are still some regulatory hurdles to go over some big ones right now if i participate in a defi project on im buying or selling against the smart contract whos on the other side of that smart contract right now people are very nervous that you need to kyc and aml the other side of the smart contractbut i would tell you that the smartest minds in this business are working on solving that and once that little piece of the puzzle gets solved its a hard thing to solve but it will get solved all of a sudden were going to see these defi companies companies like compound and the interest rate market explodeand were investing in those because i see and that will be the threat to banks in finance companies bitcoin isnt the threat to jp morgan bitcoin is a digital asset that they should have been trading and allowing their investors to participate in and they will nowthe real threat to morgan and goldman sachs and the legacy financial institutions is when we start bringing blockchains to their products and thats what defi is doingmark decambre now i know youre a big bull but what would you say to folks as we look at bitcoin hit a record near  whats the floor i would think that you know skeptics would still say it can go to zeromike novogratz it cant go to zero like going to  is like oh lets be sensationalistic there are over  million people that own a piece of a bitcoin its the single biggest distributed asset outside of the dollar in historymark decambre do you think this is something thatmike novogratz its like six guys creating a tupperware scheme its in every village in every country in america it is now in insurance companies in hedge funds theres not a macro hedge fund that i know of that doesnt own bitcoin or have a position in bitcoin its in insurance companies its in real money now its going into the equity marketsand so in the last four months if there is one message here loud and clear is crypto is now an asset class and its all of  trillion thats  of  of global wealth if you dont think its going to   to  of global wealth in the next few years youre not watching the trendsand so the momentum behind whats happening here is real ive hired  people in the last six months not because im a lunatic im hiring  unbelievably talented people because we see demand from customers of all sorts andmark decambre and youre youre not alone mike we heard from tim draper earlier who said you know basically all his money is in bitcoin now and he only uses fiat for paying for services and paying people and whatnot that might changebut just to hit upon the risk level again this notion of a bubble and sort of the cyclical nature of bitcoin theres a note a recent survey from bank of america that says  of investment professionals think cryptocurrency is in a bubble you agree with that notionmike novogratz no i dont listen i will say two things bitcoin is  to  vol asset right now so anyone who understands volatility means youre going to have big moves when youre   vol assetover the next year two or three years that volatility will come down with more institutional adoption but you shouldnt put  of your net worth in unless your net worth is as big as tims because that volatility  will make you throw up all over your dinner tablemark decambre i have wondered whose net worth is bigger you or tims but i kind of  that question from james who  a bit of that question as a part of our audience heres another one ill put you from daleseveral smart people including bill gates feel that bitcoin has negative implications for the climate what are your thoughts on that obviously weve heard that quite a bit in terms of the energy expended tomike novogratz you know electric razors have a negative implication for the climate too because they use electricity listen bitcoin uses electricity because it fulfills a really important role right protecting  trillion of worth is supposed to cost something if it didnt cost something id be nervousnow the bitcoin community gets that theres an environmental concern more and more bitcoins being mined with green energy i was on a call a week ago with some of the biggest leaders in the space on talking about going carbon neutral by   like other industries are doing were looking at bitcoin mines with clean nuclear power with wind energy with solarand so because bitcoin really acts as a battery it stores excess electricity if you want to think about it and lots of places where green energy is used its not a constant use case and so bitcoin really fits in well in those placesmark decambre i got i got to leave it that but before we jet out mike can you give me a quick bitcoin nearterm outlook and a fiveyear outlook toomike novogratz yeah sure i will i think we could end the year at  bitcoin  a bitcoin in the next week certainly we could have some volatility because of the excitement around coinbase ive seen a lot of weird coins like doge coin and even xrp have huge retail spikes which means theres a lot of frenzy right now that never ends well and so well probably have a washout at one pointbut i think with all the institutional adoption we could be at  at the end of the year and  by  thats when bitcoin would eclipse gold and so listen things could change chairman powell and janet yellen might find religion and all of a sudden become fiscally conservative and stop printing money and the deficit might collapse and then all assets would have a harder time rightsomeone said are we in a bubble well stocks are going higher baseball cards are going higher assets are going higher because fiat money is being debased we are printing money like weve never done in our lifetimes thats also whats driving all the assets highermark decambre thats great so much food for thought and i really appreciate you taking time out mike i wish we had more time so thanks so much
