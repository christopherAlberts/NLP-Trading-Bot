yearthe nearly  billion public debut of the largest us crypto exchange coinbase coin is sending ripples across the borderless crypto ecosystemmichael wu chief executive of the crypto finance firm amber group is feeling the excitement all the way in hong kongthis is great news for the industry coinbase is setting a path that at least some in the industry thought was impossible wu said in an interview coinbase shows the world that you can both embrace crypto as new technology and at the same time be compliant and regulatedbacked by coinbase ventures and cryptoasset investment firm paradigm amber group which engages in crypto trading lending marketmaking and asset management manages over  billion in assetsthe coinbase of asiaprior to setting up amber wu worked as a portfolio manager at a billiondollar hedge fund but it was his foreign exchange experience on morgan stanleys trading floor in hong kong that first brought bitcoin to his attentioni was running the offshore renminbi book for morgan stanley and at the time bitcoin was very related to all the fx control and outflows he said as an fx trader i realized that this asset class is borderless it is immediatein  when bitcoin was trading at around  wu bought shares of the grayscale bitcoin trust gbtc which was trading at a  to  premium to bitcoins spot pricejust a few months after wu bought his shares bitcoins price jumped to around  but the premium of gbtc also shot up to around  he recalledas a professional trader and investor it didnt make sense for me to pay  for  worth of bitcoin he saidso we started buying bitcoin spotback then the exchanges for buying and selling bitcoins were very sketchy and that put a damper on wus desire to enter the crypto space in late  the crypto market became active again but there was still a lack of infrastructure to support crypto finance activitiesthats when wu and his cofounders decided to build their own firm three years later amber group serves more than  institutional clients and has traded over  billion across more than  electronic exchanges according to its websitevery early on we decided to choose the same path as coinbase he said we decided to be compliant to embrace regulation and to be institutional while at the same time using this new technology to be innovative in our productsthe first crypto company to test the marketsas the first cryptofocused company to go public coinbase is not only testing the stock market but also the current crypto bull market that has sent bitcoin and ether up over  and  in the past year respectivelyin part driven by institutional inflows the price of bitcoin has more than tripled in just over four months as coinbase goes public some investors are worried that more conservative institutions will opt for coinbase instead of bitcoin as a proxy for crypto exposurewu is not as concerned he explains that the coinbase stock is priced based on factors like discounted future cash flows which means that its transaction volumes are the most relevant factor influencing its stock price according to a company filing  of the coinbases sales in  came from fees it charged usersif you buy coinbases stock its because you fundamentally believe there will be more and more crypto trading volume and a lot of that will happen on coinbase he saidon the other hand investors in bitcoin are saying that it is better than gold as a form of inflation hedge and a store of wealth amid the flooding liquidity that is depreciating fiat currencies around the world he addedtherell be shortterm correlations that might help investors with some kind of hedging strategies wu said i think both are good assets in the long term but very different assetsbitcoin price correction could be a good thingthe shortterm correlation was already showing during coinbases first few hours of tradingbitcoin briefly breached a record high of  early wednesday just hours before coinbases market open however as coinbase decreased to around  from an open price of  bitcoin also retraced to just above  at around  pm etmany bitcoin investors had expected the digital token to fetch a new high based on the momentum and bullish sentiment around coinbases direct listing but wu said it doesnt really matter whether bitcoin reaches  or  next monthin the long run its not even about what price you buy he said because this is an asset class that will go from  trillion now to at least  trillion or even  trillion in three to five years in my viewin the near term a correction in bitcoin price that sends it back to the  or  levels might actually be good for the industryi personally think if we see a correction in price it will be a great sign for the industry because then it gives more room for the institutional investors he said for them it may not be about the price either itll be about how they can get liquiditybecause bitcoin is capped at  million and there are only  million bitcoins outstanding there will be fewer and fewer sellers if the price keeps rallying according to wuif natural sellers like bitcoin miners or early adopters decide not to sell because prices keep going up he said then institutions cannot buy because theres just not enough circulation liquidity for them to really buy at a meaningful sizehe continued on the other hand if we do see some kind of price retracement if we do see opportunities for these institutions to build their positions again that will actually benefit the industry longterm
