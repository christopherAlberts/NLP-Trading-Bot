for the past  months wall street has been enjoying an incredible rally for instance the benchmark sp  which tumbled  in less than five weeks during the first quarter of  ended the year higher by more than  thats nearly double its average annual return over the past  years the techheavy nasdaq composite performed even betterbut neither index has been able to hold a candle to the returns offered by the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap bitcoin cryptobtcbitcoin may be soaring but its a flawed investmentover the trailing year through feb  bitcoin is up  back out a bit further and youll see bitcoin has delivered gains of approximately  over the trailing five years put into another context if you had invested  into bitcoin on feb   youd have more than  million as of feb  this rally has predominantly been based on the premise that bitcoin challenges traditional monetary theory specifically optimists point to its  million token limit its increasing utility among merchants as an accepted form of payment and its superior blockchain which can expedite the settlement of payments especially crossborder payments as reasons for the risebitcoin has also received plenty of attention following big buys from elon musks tesla motors and michael saylors microstrategy tesla invested  billion into bitcoin this past week with microstrategy buying more than  billion worth of tokens in recent monthswhile theres no denying that bitcoin has plenty of nearterm momentum its an asset that appears to be filled with flaws and misconceptions in no particular orderbitcoins scarcity is held together by loose promises of community consensus that its token count wont rise which is hardly concretethere are virtually no barriers to entry in developing blockchain or tethering a digital token to an underlying ledgerbitcoin lacks gamechanging utility though a few big names tesla may choose to accept tokens as a form of payment more than  of us businesses with at least one employee dont currently accept bitcoinits my belief that emotions and technical analysis ie pretty charts are all that keep the bitcoin train going in other words theres nothing tangible sustainable or investable about this rallythis trio of unstoppable stocks are much better buysrather than investing in bitcoin my suggestion would be to take your money and put it to work in the following trio of

as measured by annualized gpv are hopping onboard in increasing numbers in the septemberended quarter nearly  of gpv came from merchants with at least  in annualized gpv up from  in the third quarter of  since this is a merchant feebased operating segment greater adoption by bigger merchants would further boost growth and gross profitarguably even more exciting is squares other operating segment cash app this digital peertopeer payment platform grew its monthly active user count from  million to  million between the end of  and  whats more daily active users were up  percentage points to  in the septemberended quarter from  whats makes cash app tick is the ability to make purchases  cash card acts like a traditional debit card that tethers to a users cash app account  and invest in particular cash app has been popular for buying and selling bitcoin the beauty here is that it doesnt matter how well or poorly bitcoin performs as long as users keep trading cash apps gross profit will continue soaringteladoc healthanother unstoppable stock with the potential to run circles around bitcoin over the long run is telehealth provider teladoc health nysetdocto get the obvious out of the way teladoc health was an unquestioned beneficiary of the coronavirus disease   pandemic with physicians aiming to keep  and highrisk patients out of their offices demand shifted in a big way to virtual visits after logging  million virtual visits in  teladoc estimates that  million visits occurred in but keep in mind that teladocs growth isnt entirely due to the  pandemic it was already growing its sales at an annualized pace of  between  and  and was having little issue landing fortune  companies and health systems as clients since telemedicine is a win for all parties involved
