are plenty of reasons for caution the virtual currencys value has soared and plunged repeatedly since its introduction in  it fell  just from feb  to march  last yearand while bitcoin is referred to as a digital currency it doesnt meet at least one important criterion of a currency it lacks widespread usage as a medium of exchange in legitimate commercial transactionsin november digitalpayment processors handled just  million of merchant sales worldwide in bitcoin according to research firm chainalysis by comparison total us retail sales registered  billion in novembermany pros think individual investors should steer clear of the currency entirely but others suggest investors would do well to consider adding bitcoin to their portfolio  but generally only as a small percentage of their overall assetsmaking bitcoin a significant part of your portfolio would increase your risk substantially says eswar prasad a tradepolicy professor at cornell university who is writing a book about digital currencies but a marginal amount seems worthwhile given recent dynamicssome of the best arguments for and against investing in bitcointhe pluseswhat bitcoin really represents is a store of value as such it can be used to hedge against inflation and against declines in other financial assets such as stocks bonds and the dollar some industry pros say bitcoin has appreciated while the dollar has slid since last marchthe store of value role for bitcoin is similar to that of gold i put it in the same bucket says john rekenthaler vice president of research at investmentresearch firm morningstarsome advocates endorse investing in bitcoin  though its volatility means timing can still be an issue  saying it will eventually stabilize and then be used more for legitimate commercepaypal has said it plans to allow bitcoin to be used as a payment method starting early this year a competitor square also has shown interest in bitcoin commerce and announced in october that it bought  million of the assetsome analysts also see an upside to bitcoins volatility its erratic trading keeps bitcoins correlation with stocks and bonds low creating diversificationvolatility is bad if youre tapping it into the main part of your portfolio mr rekenthaler says but if its on the side thats good that helped gold become a diversifierhe adds we mutualfund owners should start to think about bitcoin but im not saying the average investor should have itbecause bitcoin is so volatile investors dont need a lot of it to diversify a portfoliomr rekenthaler reckons that a  allocation in bitcoin will diversify a balanced portfolio as effectively as a  position in the largest alternative mutual fund jpmorgan hedged equity jheqxwhile karim ahamed investment strategist at cerity partners in chicago isnt advocating for bitcoin investment at this point his company has begun studying whether to investmr ahamed says having a small investment in bitcoin could work much like an allocation to venture capitalin venture capital he says one in  investments is a home run two to three lose money and the others about break even the home run makes up for a lot of missesbill miller iv a portfolio manager at miller value partners and son of legendary investor bill miller has about  of his personal portfolio in bitcoinits a mistake for people not to own bitcoin the younger mr miller saysa major appeal of bitcoin for mr miller is its scarcity he says there is about  billion of bitcoin outstanding compared with his estimate of about  trillion for standard currenciesdemand is outpacing supply says mr miller who interprets that to mean bitcoin should keep rising and trading should remain volatilethe minusesthere is no obvious way to determine bitcoins fair value bitcoin stands as a store of value only because some investors believe it is onebitcoin depends on the faith of investors and nothing more prof prasad says it could equally well go to zero tomorrow if  of investors soldother types of investment depend on similar underlying faith but when it comes to stocks and bonds for instance there are legitimate mathematical models to determine their value stocks produce earnings and bonds produce income for example which helps determine their valuesmany analysts also question bitcoins value as a hedge this year it has largely risen in tandem with stocks and bonds at a time when inflation is quiescent in addition no major inflation has broken out since bitcoin came on the scene  years ago so it is difficult to know whether it truly guards against price increasesyou need that empirical testing mr ahamed saysmeanwhile some critics question whether bitcoins scarcity is a selling point that scarcity also means illiquid and volatile trading as evidenced by bitcoins rollercoaster ride during its  years of existenceskeptics also challenge the view that bitcoins volatility can be viewed as beneficial to a portfolio for diversification purposesif the volatility comes just from speculation im not sure i want it as an uncorrelated asset mr ahamed says
