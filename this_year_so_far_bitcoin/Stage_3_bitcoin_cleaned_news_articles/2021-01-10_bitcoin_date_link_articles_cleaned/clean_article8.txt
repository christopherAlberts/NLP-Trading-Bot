the stock market had a good  with the sp  up  cryptocurrency bitcoin on the other hand was up more than  for the year in the last month alone bitcoins price has more than doubledbut bitcoins incredible rise may mean that a fall is imminent with that in mind we asked three motley fool contributors for their top stock picks that didnt have big rises in  and look undervalued right now they came back with corteva nysectva general electric nysege and dow nysedow heres why they think these stocks have better prospects than bitcoinharvester of joylee samaha corteva the world is always going to need more food and farmers are always going to need to improve crop yields and protect their harvest thats where corteva comes in created out of the breakup of dowdupont its a play on longterm demand for food crops and also a value stock in the makingthe agriscience company generates around  of its revenue from seeds of which  is from corn and  from soybean and  from crop protection  from herbicides and  from insecticides longterm demand for higheryielding seeds is assured given the need to feed a growing population and to increase profitability for farmers for example us corn yields have gone up from around  bushels per acre in  to around  bushels per acre in  its a remarkable achievement which shows how valuable higheryielding seeds such as cortevas are to farmers around the world in addition if a crop is going to be harvested then it will need protectioncorteva has attracted the interest of an activist hedge fund starboard value whose case for buying the stock is based on the potential for corteva to improve profit margins to the level of its peers in fact corteva is making progress on that front with its earnings before interest depreciation and amortization margin rising to  in the first nine months compared to  in the same period last yeartrading at  times next years estimated earnings cortevas end markets are relatively stable and the potential for margin expansion is substantial its not a glamorous stock but cortevas earnings growth potential is significant and its the sort of overlooked stock that investors should be considering right nowa general idea to get charged up aboutscott levine general electric bitcoins recent performance probably has longterm holders feeling vindicated  and a lot richer those who have hesitated to buy the cryptocurrency however are likely reluctant to begin investing now dubious that theres more growth on the horizon fortunately for them there are plenty of investing opportunities that offer much more reasonable valuations such as general electrictumbling more than  in  shares of ge vastly underperformed the market over the past month ges stock has inched up about  higher but i think the market is underestimating the companys potential in  and beyond investors consequently can pick up the stock on the cheap as shares are trading hands at  times operational cash flow  a considerable discount to their fiveyear average multiple of granted there are plenty of bears who believe that ge will continue to stagnate in  but while theyre fearful that the company may not prosper investors willing to take a contrarian approach should heed warren buffetts advice and be greedy when others are fearful although its highly unlikely that ges aviation business will fully recover in  the companys renewable energy business will likely benefit from the recent stimulus bill that has sent many renewable energy stocks soaring over the past few weeks an industry leader in wind turbine manufacturing ge will surely benefit from the legislation that benefits the wind industry a oneyear extension of the production tax credit for wind power projects that begin construction in  and a  tax credit for offshore wind projects that begin construction in the next five years besides wind power ge may benefit from the more than  billion allocated for grid modernizationwhile ge is a long way from returning to its former glory of generating annual free cash flow of  billion like it did in  the company has made progress in bouncing back from its declining cash flow in the middle of the last decadethere may be a rocky road for ge in the near term but the companys backlog  including  billion for the aviation segment and  billion for power and renewables  suggests that its products and solutions remain in demand and as the company is now on firmer financial footing i think ge represents an interesting opportunity for patient investors who are willing to look at the company in a new light  not as a shadow of its former selfa reliable cash machinejohn bromels dow im not going to lie to you bitcoin could continue its astonishing rise it could as some bitcoin bulls have suggested be valued at  by the end of  however its also very possible that its value could plunge and those who buy in now could see their investments evaporate after all volatile bitcoin has no earnings no cash flow and no business model to evaluate  its worth whatever people think its worthim not saying you shouldnt buy bitcoin at these prices but if you do you should probably balance that risk with a company that has a business model thats stood the test of time generates reliable cash flow and looks undervalued at the moment one such business is dow chemical its one of the other companies that was spun off from dowdupont however while corteva kept the congloms agribusiness portfolio dow held onto the performance chemicals side of the businessperformance chemicals are basically chemical products that arent sold on their own but are used as parts of other products or processes think lubricants for industrial machinery or automobile coatings or packaging for pharmaceuticals this diversified portfolio has allowed dow to reliably crank out cash even during the height of the pandemic in the second quarter of  it generated more than  billion in cash flow it uses that cash to pay a generous dividend currently yielding despite this reliability dow underperformed the broader market in  even with its dividend factored in wall street seems to have been concerned about the pandemics effect on manufacturing and auto sales big markets for dows chemicals however weve already seen those markets begin to recover which is why i think dow will outperform in
