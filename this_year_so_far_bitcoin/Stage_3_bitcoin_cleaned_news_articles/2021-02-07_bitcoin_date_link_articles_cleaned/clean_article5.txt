peter bofinger identifies the cryptocurrency’s achilles heelpeter bofingerfollowing the steep rise in the price of bitcoin since autumn  public interest in this cryptocurrency has been reignited yet the massive drop in price since its peak on january  and the subsequent rebound show the volatility of such an investmentno one can predict where bitcoin’s price will go this is simply because speculation is always about expectations in concrete terms anyone who buys bitcoin today has to form expectations about what expectations other investors will form about bitcoin and the latter in turn must also ask themselves what the expectations of other investors might bejohn maynard keynes not only a gifted economist but also a fierce speculator explained these dynamics in his  classic the general theory of employment interest and money by the prefeminist analogy of a beauty contest in his times newspapers organised such contests where readers had to choose the supposedly prettiest among the faces of women and they had only a chance of reward when they decided on the face which received the most votesit is not a case of choosing those  that to the best of one’s judgment are really the prettiest nor even those that average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest we have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be and there are some i believe who practice the fourth fifth and higher degreesfinancial history teaches that such processes can lead to pronounced price bubbles which when they burst can end in a total losscuttingedge thinking straight to your inbox social europe publishes thoughtprovoking articles on the big political and economic issues of our time analysed from a

productionanyone who buys bitcoin today should know what they are buying many people regard bitcoin as digital gold but is this an adequate analogy the mechanisms of private money production which at first glance are very complex can be illustrated by a simple example mr smith decides to participate in the currency competition he prints one million notes bearing ‘ valuecoin’ on the back it is expressly pointed out that the holder of such a note has no legal claim against mr smithnow mr smith can try to sell his notes against the euro he starts with an exchange rate of  but why would anyone spend € on a piece of paper that has no intrinsic value and promises nothing mr smith refers to the example of bitcoin in which the quantity is also limited by comparison there is no upper limit on government currencies the valuecoin could thus have the advantage of gaining value against official money in the manner of bitcoin soon  valuecoin could be worth much more than €now one could wonder why only mr smith should have the privilege to make money out of nothing again it is geared to the model of bitcoin he decides not to put all the notes into circulation himself and to establish a mechanism for the issuance of valuecoin which ensures that the valuecoin money supply can only increase graduallythus he organises a game of dice with friends once a week whenever a participant rolls a one on four dice simultaneously he receives  bills to prevent the bills from circulating too quickly over time the number received on successful dice rolls is reduced so after the first year participants only receive  bills for a successful throw after that the amount reduces furtherplease help us improve public policy debatesas you may know social europe is an independent publisher we

present then no longer four but five dice are used and ‘five ones’ must be rolled as more and more interested parties are expected to attend the dice game over time this mechanism also makes it increasingly difficult for those involved to create new valuecoinshuge profitsthis is similar to the emission process of bitcoin ‘mining’ where the degree of difficulty has risen from a factor of one in  when bitcoin started to around  trillion most recently in other words the initiator of the scheme made huge profits by mining bitcoin in the early yearsmr smith assumes that knowledge of such a mechanism which ensures a gradual expansion of valuecoins in addition to the fixed ceiling helps make his private currency attractive overall it ensures that the benefit of being able to exchange worthless bills for government money is not left to mr smith alone rather it is socialised with the participants of the dice game who can acquire the valuecoin notes by strenuous dicingthis coincides with the bitcoin model where miners have to solve highly complex computational tasks which requires huge computing power and enormous power consumption since one gets to the valuecoin notes more quickly in the beginning those who participate from the beginning are favoured this of course especially benefits mr smith as the initiator of the schemenothing fundamentally changes in the mechanisms described so far if mr smith does not issue his money as printed bills but digitally via accounts he sets up a centralised valuecoin settlement system where all holders of valuecoins keep an account after a successful throw they will receive no bills but the valuecoins will be credited to the participant’s account in the clearing system of mr smithby buying valuecoins against the euro from the dicer outsiders can also open an account on the valuecoin billing system this makes the private money system perfect digital transfers can now be made between account holders with the digitalisation of the whole scheme the dicegame evenings are abolished now anyone can build up valuecoin balances by participating in the online gamedisappearing organiserwhat distinguishes mr smith´s valuecoin from bitcoin so far is the central accounting system he manages instead bitcoin uses a decentralised system the ‘distributed ledger’ in such a system there is no central accountant anymore rather in principle each participant can make bookings in the ledger those participants with higher computational power have however an advantage as they may be able to perform more ‘proof of work’—akin to valuecoin’s dice throwsin any event the organiser of the whole thing disappears behind the scheme he has created thus for outsiders it is no longer clear that mr smith is the creator of valuecoinin terms of economic logic bitcoin is nothing other than valuecoin the only difference is that bitcoins are not created in a transparent dice game but in a complex extremely energyintensive process crucially here too the holder has no claim against the issuer who is the big winner in this game even if he participates in the issuance he is at an advantage because it is particularly easy to get hold of the coins at the beginningone often hears that there is no redemption right for the holders of a euro banknote either the difference is that banknotes are legal tender and the european central bank has a monopoly on their issuance while bitcoin is in increasingly intense competition with around  cryptocurrencies thus at any time another cryptocurrency with better technology can become the darling of investors displacing the ageing bitcointhe competitive pressure from new issuers is also a fundamental difference visàvis precious metals in particular gold whose special position no new chemical element could emerge to challenge the lack of a unique selling proposition is therefore bitcoin’s achilles heel while there is no alternative to physical gold there are other cryptocurrencies that could dethrone bitcoin sooner or laterthis article is a joint publication by social europe and ipsjournal
