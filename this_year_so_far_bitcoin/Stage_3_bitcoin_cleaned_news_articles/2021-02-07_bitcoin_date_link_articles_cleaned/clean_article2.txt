it’s staggering to think that  invested in apple in  is worth  today that’s a return of  per annumas eyewatering as these returns may be they are dwarfed by the returns on investments in cryptocurrencies —  worth of bitcoin invested  years ago has grown to  million or  per annumso what is it about bitcoin’s value that has led to this astonishing increase in its priceapple generates value by designing and manufacturing its products and services such as laptops phones and streaming servicesbitcoin on the other hand is a decentralised cryptocurrency that aims to serve as ‘money’ the function of money includes serving as unit of account allowing the valuation of goods in the same unit such as the australian dollar as a medium of exchange one can buy and sell goods using the currency and as a store of value one can keep the currency for future usethe value of money to its users depends on how well it serves these functions it could be argued that at present bitcoin serves none of these functionsone key issue with bitcoin has been the high volatility of its price in the last five years there were more than  days where the price of bitcoin fluctuated by  or morethis makes bitcoin unattractive as a store of value a certain amount of bitcoin might buy you cappuccino today but the same amount might only buy you a babyccino or around half a coffee the next dayno one with an interest in storing value would want to hold bitcoin for any period of time as a resultthe same issue makes vitcoin unattractive as a medium of exchange imagine a farmer who sold her produce in exchange for bitcoin because of the high uncertainty about how valuable bitcoin will be the next day when she needs to pay for her own expensescurrently only a handful of merchants accept bitcoin as mode of payment in australiain addition to buying coffee at a few select places you can pay bills at australia post using bitcoins albeit at a very high transaction fee of about a key factor underpinning a currency’s adoption as money is the trust that society places in ittrust in modernday currencies such as the australian dollar is largely based on people’s trust in the government that issues the currency the australian government through the reserve bank controls the supply of money and guarantees its stabilitythe australian dollar is also legal tender in australia which means that an australian store cannot refuse to accept australian dollars as a mode of paymentthe question then is why bitcoin’s value has increased so muchone possible explanation is that its investors expect bitcoin to offer value in the future even if its current adoption is sparse there has been recent interest from financial institutions in bitcoin and this could have raised the expectation of it being a serious player in the currency spaceanother point is that the technologies on which bitcoin is based in particular the blockchain do provide valueblockchain in its various flavours has been adopted to solve fundamental problems in various domains such as transport and securities trading — this is the space that one should watch closelybitcoin in the end is just one of the applications of blockchainso trust in bitcoin is based on trust in its underlying blockchain technologybitcoin’s blockchain is a publicly available distributed database of all historical transactions these transactions are verified by socalled miners who are incentivised by means of rewarding them with bitcoins to include only legal bitcoin transactions in the blockchainbitcoin’s code is administered by a handful of people and no known accountable entitythe fact that trust emanates from the crowd decentralisation means that to predict how trust in bitcoin may evolve we need to understand how crowds behaveunfortunately the science on that is not optimisticcrowds may be trusted for a long time but are easily affected by free riding and certainly don’t make rational decisions even if populated by rational agents outlined in arrow’s theorem this has implications for the process of deciding on rules that govern cryptocurrenciesfor example a major risk with bitcoin is that a group could create its own variant effectively creating its own new currency if the new currency gains widespread adoption then the old currency may devalue potentially wiping out the value of people’s holdingsbut there’s another issue that casts doubt on the future of bitcoin as moneycentral banking theory and history tell us that it is difficult to have two or more parallel currencies in order to be effective the monetary policy tools used by central banks require strong control over the local currencygovernments like ours in australia are unlikely to give up control over their own currency anytime soonso should we expect society to ever adopt bitcoin as moneyat present it looks unlikely but there are special cases where use of bitcoin does provide value as moneyone example is a situation where the value of a local currency in a country fluctuates more than the value of bitcoin in this case people may prefer to use bitcoin — and we’re already seeing an example of that in venezuelaalternatively the fact that bitcoin is decentralised and as a result beyond the power of any government may facilitate international transfers aimed to bypass sanctionsfor most other purposes like buying a coffee or paying bills cryptocurrencies — at least right now — provide a fun factor but not much utilitythis article was first published on pursuit read the original article
