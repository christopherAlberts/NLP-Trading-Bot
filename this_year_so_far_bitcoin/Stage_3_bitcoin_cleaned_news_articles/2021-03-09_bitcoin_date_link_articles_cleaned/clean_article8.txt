imho green wavec of b is now underway or has possibly already been completed and red wavec should ideally target around  why is that because  wave black  often retrace approximately  of the prior same degree  wave  shown with the black box besides cwaves are usually equal to the length of the awave since red wavea went from  to  and the current red waveb rally should typically top around  to   the next leg lower wavec should thus target about  are you still hanging with me as you can see this price target range fits well with the  retrace level mentioned priorcwaves can however extend and in this case go as low as  which is close to the  retrace at  but for now i prefer the upper end of the black box as in bull markets downside often disappoints and upside surprises how do we know the next leg lower is in order it is confirmed on a move below the end of red wavea low but warning bells will already be ringing on a break below yesterday’s low  followed by a break below the green waveb low at now btc can have one more trick up its sleeve as  waves of this magnitude are often more a sideways affair where recent gains are digested more in price than time ie a trading range is made this means the red bwavebounce can even target as high as  ranging from  to  before that pesky cwave takes hold ie “the rug gets pulled from under” as they say bringing the price back to  once again that would be called an irregular flat in ewp terms see here how do we know if this tricky bwave pattern is evolving break and daily close above the ath with the first warning on a daily close above
