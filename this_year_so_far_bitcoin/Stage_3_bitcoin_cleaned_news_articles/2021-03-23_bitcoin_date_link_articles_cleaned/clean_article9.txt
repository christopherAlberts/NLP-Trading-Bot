ray dalio who founded the world’s largest hedge fund – bridgewater – has published a trenchant analysis going back several hundred years of the world’s long term debt cycleshe found the cycles rhyme and average out to  years he discusses in detail the steps involved from cradle to grave of each cycle war tends to be the end point with the victor tending to be a new regime whose fiat then takes the place of the fallen regime’s fiat as the world’s reserve currencysuch status confers great power on the respective currency in having the leverage thus upper hand in trade and monetary policy indeed when the us sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold us petrodollars have also set the clear trade advantage for the us given the way the us wields thempast title holdersbut in times past it was reserve currencies such as the dutch gilder or british pound that set the tone for the rest of the world each time the saying “from shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations” held some truthinitial focus discipline and hard work yielded strong results but wealth prosperity and abundance eventually led the leading nation in question down a slippery slope eventually “leftist” policies which focused on soaking rich individuals and successful companies with taxes along with bloated government spending on illdefined “pork belly” projects hampered economic growtheventually the weight of the government became too much to bear as their debts sped past their profits forcing them to turn to their central bank for hand outs the central bank then launched its various forms of quantitative easing to ease their debt burden but the more they printed the more indebt they became so instead of growing their way out of their debt they got buried by it until their fiat currency started to plummet due to overprintingthis often had a hyperinflationary effect which ended up destroying their currencyus dollar wins post wwiithe most recent changing of the guard came at the end of world war ii with the us dollar as the new sovereign currency this was  years ago underscoring dalio’s point that we are in the final stages of this long term debt cyclehe has recently pondered publicly as to what if anything could create an endpoint to this cycle that is not ravaged by a global economic wrecking ball or culminate in world war iiithe answer to dalio’s queryi have answered dalio’s question on record “expotech” or technologies that grow at an exponential rate tend to get underestimated as the wealth created over time becomes exponentialsingularly the doubling effect results in geometric growth thus what starts out as a grain of sand soon becomes an entire beach thus the historically record levels of debt in which the world finds itself does not have to have a crash landing because such expotech such as blockchain ai and vr did not exist in past cyclesexpotech vs govopolybut the planet is wielding the sharpest doubleedged sword countering all the glories of expotech is the rise of authoritarian government policy it is just a matter of degreelegendary futures trader and friend ed seykota published a book several years ago called “govopoly in the  day”he said that once the cost in time and money spent dealing with regulatory bureaucracy outweighs productivity it is the beginning of the end by the  day because in pond ecosystems duckweed doubles each day over the first  days or so it goes relatively unnoticed but by day  it starts to affect pond life and by day  it doubles once more only to suffocate all life in the pond he says we are at day duckweed of course is the analogy to government bureaucracy overregulation and authoritarian lawseykota’s analogyseykota writes that this is the natural order of things if you compound a penny at the time christ was born at a nominal  apr the amount of money would be over  x  or  quadrillion  quad   tril well beyond anything in the world today thus hyperinflation which sometimes comes at the end of a debt cycle has a way of sweeping away the old order and is why no sovereign currency keeps its title indefinitelybitcoin creates separation of money and stateultimately the largest catalyst that creates the noncrash landing and relatively peaceful ending is bitcoin which is the world’s first secure uncensorable limitless borderless transfer of valueits usage doubles every year so currently stands at around  it won’t be long before a sizeable portion of the planet is using transacting or holding bitcoin to guard against falling fiat already hnwis and major corporations are lining up to initiate or increase their holdings when you combine that with the supply crisis due to major institutions buying up bitcoin such as paypal square and grayscale you have an explosive combination where demand well exceeds supply bitcointhus the current bull market may not even be half way complete my keynote speech at the geneva wealthtech event in  contained a slide where i predict  a bitcoin by the end of  my prediction still stands based on  metrics among othersi believe we will get to at least  in this current bull cycle which may end in late   the question will be whether bitcoin has to go through its typical  or greater peaktotrough correction before a new bull can begin given the number of major tipping points in which the global economy finds itself if not the bear could be less punishing than prior bearsregardless my metrics have called every major top and bottom in bitcoin since  to within weeks so trying to predict the depth of a bear market is futile just keep close focus
