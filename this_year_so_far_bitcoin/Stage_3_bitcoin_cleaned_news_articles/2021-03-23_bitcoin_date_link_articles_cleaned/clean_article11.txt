we can apply maslow’s hierarchy of needs to bitcoin to find out what needs it must obtain and maintain to succeedin order for bitcoin to achieve hyperbitcoinization it has to fulfill certain network and monetary needs without obtaining and more importantly maintaining these needs bitcoin can not succeed if bitcoin can obtain and maintain these needs then there is nothing that can stop itthis article is a play off of maslow’s hierarchy of needs the idea that people have to go through certain levels of life to eventually reach happiness and live to their full potential this theory can be applied to bitcoinimage via nikcantminethis is the game plan this is how bitcoin achieves world reserve currency statusnetwork needsbase layer fair launchno currency has a shot at mass adoption or a chance at being the global reserve currency if it’s been cheated from the startone of the many things that separates bitcoin from the thousands of other cryptocurrencies was the fair launch on january   over two months after satoshi nakamoto released the bitcoin white paper on october   not to mention the reason why bitcoin was created in the first place which was a direct result of the  to  financial crash fiat currency and central banking it was made as a solution to a problem all other coins came after seeing bitcoin’s success tried to copy it and failedsatoshi didn’t create bitcoin in the hopes of scamming others he did it to provide anyone an inclusive monetary system that was fair not only was there no premine where a founder allocates a large portion of the coins to themselves satoshi also made sure to give potential participants advanced warning before launch it appears that it was important to satoshi for bitcoin to be perceived as not having been created for any one individuals gain at the expense of otherssatoshi programmed the first block to be locked in resulting in the first block reward of  btc being unattainable neither satoshi nor anyone else could grab those bitcoin and now there are  fewer btc out of the approximately  million total supply available if the creator would have just taken the btc it would not have been fair after that first block was in place miners could then start hashing away and building the chainminting new currency onto the blockchain must be fair with no one entity having an advantage over others this system needs to be inclusive where anyone has the ability to run the numbers and verify for themselves that everything is correct honest participants are rewarded and bad actors face consequences whatever system is used to create more currency must absolutely come at a cost to protect against any monopolies arising from gaming the systembitcoin solved this with distributed proof of work powsecond layer distributed networksince bitcoin was fairly launched with no malicious intent we can be confident in building and expanding the network if bitcoin really is going to succeed then it cannot be centralized like gold fiat and altcoinsbitcoin is robust because of two reasons one the creator vanished long ago never to be seen again there is no central authority to arrest or have them use their influence to destroy the project two the global distribution of the developers economic nodes and miners these three sets of stakeholders provide a check and balance against each other so no single party has controlder gigi makes a fantastic analogy when he says bitcoin is like ants you can step on ants and kill their hill in one area but you’ll never ever be able to kill all of the ants in the world because of their massive numbers and distributionbitcoin developers are the ones who work day and night to advance bitcoin forward these developers must build things that are in demand by the users or else no one will use their software it is not in developers’ best interests to attack the network because everything is out in the open there is no way to sneakily attack bitcoin because of how long the process takes if a developer does try to attack bitcoin his or her reputation flies out the window and no one will use their software anymore their proposals to change the network are intensively reviewed by other devs during the process of submitting bitcoin improvement proposals bips anyone can become a bitcoin developer and there are developers spread all around the worldneither the miners or nodes have complete control of the network the miners slowly write transactions into the ledger and mint new currency nodes verify the transactions on the blockchain quickly and efficiently but cannot issue new currency miners have to follow the rules that the nodes set forth which may only change if individual node operators choose to run new softwarenetwork participants must prioritize keeping bitcoin decentralized the more distributed it is the more censorship resistant it is the more censorship resistant it is the better it can defend itself from nation states and others from controlling the network good news for bitcoin the network is growing strong in january of this year the amount of full nodes hit a new all time high of  according to bitnodesioto whoever’s thinking “bitcoin will fail when governments  percent attack the blockchain” i could write about this but for the sake of both my time and yours here’s a quick twominute video explaining itmonetary needsthird layer store of valuebitcoin’s distributed network needed to be in place before everyone could start safely and securely storing their wealth at the time of writing this is the point of the pyramid i believe we are inbitcoin is currently thriving in this aspect after recently reaching a total market cap of over  trillion with trillions more poised to enter the market today the world has a store of value crisis there is about  trillion in cash around the world just sitting there waiting to be put into an actual store of value there is about  trillion globally in stocks that are owned by people who would rather save than take on the risk of investing there is over  trillion in real estate but this has many flaws such as the fact that it’s easy to tax not portable and not liquid gold is an approximately  trillion dollar market cap and all it is is a shiny rock about  trillion exists in global debt bitcoin is only going to continue eating most if not all of thistwelveplus years ago bitcoin introduced itself as a new competitor on the market ever since then bitcoin has been going through price discovery to figure out where it fits on the monetary food chain bitcoin has proven to be a fantastic store of value not just because it embraces all of the qualities that good money typically has durability portability divisibility uniformity scarcity acceptability and verifiability but because it is the most liquid money and has amassed powerful network effects that is what makes it dominantretail investors have used bitcoin as a savings technology for a long time but in the past year institutions have joined us as well the flow of institutions truly started last summer when microstrategy bought  percent of the total supply of bitcoin since then we’ve seen massmutual buy  million worth of bitcoin this past december marathon patent group buy  million worth of bitcoin in january and even tesla buy  billion worth of bitcoin in february institutions are gobbling up more and more bitcoin as they understand the benefits of adopting a bitcoin standardevery single person in the world needs to be able to store their value in something that won’t leak their monetary energy over time people in developed countries are forced to invest their fiat earnings into investments in hopes to keepincrease their purchasing power people in developing countries don’t have that privilege and are forced to store their wealth in usd to escape their fastercollapsing home national currencybitcoin makes saving possible again people can actually save their wealth and let it grow without risk of devaluation over time via inflation the  million hard cap with growing user adoption cements this everyone can now build and correctly allocate wealth to improve their quality of lifefourth layer medium of exchangeafter bitcoin has sucked in trillions upon trillions of dollars the next level for bitcoin to conquer would be to become convenient enough to use and pay for goods and services in your everyday lifeit is important to realize that the bitcoin blockchain should be considered a settlement layer rather than a payment layer itself in comparison to how slow the legacy financial system is at processing payments bitcoin’s main layer is a significant improvement transactions involving fiat are unacceptably slow ach transfers take about two to three days checks debit cards and credit cards take up to  days to clear remember when transacting in fiat final settlement cannot even be performed since it is always exposed to counterparty risk of the issuer so sending large amounts of btc for it to reach final settlement in  minutes or less is a huge upgrade in comparison but we can scale higher on bitcoin through the use of additional payment layersthe good thing about bitcoin is since it’s an opensource protocol we can build solutions on top of it a similar comparison can be made to the base layer of the legacy financial system which couldn’t scale globally so they added layers on top such as square visa and mastercard to help facilitate transactions this made the network scalable for quick and cheap transactions a similar idea has been brought to bitcoin with the lightning network“the point is seven transactions a second is fine because what it’s gonna be is is it’s going to be square cash moving  million worth of bitcoin once per day and then they’re going to do that settlement and they’re going to provide  million people with a square cash account and they’re gonna do  million transactions a day on their network they’re like a secondlevel solution they’re gonna do  million transactions a day for  million people and settle it with one transaction against the blockchain and it’s gonna scale just fine bitcoin wins square wins the customers win”  michael saylora great analogy for this is when saylor was discussing george lucas’s superhero stories a superhero can have many exciting powers such as shooting lasers out of their eyes flying teleporting super speed and more but they all have one downfall they’re easy to killnow imagine a superhero that has no fancy powers like lasers or teleporting but is unkillable slow and boring nothing flashy the unkillable superhero could pick up a gun and kill all of the other fancy superheroes while fending off attacks with ease the unkillable superhero that can pick up new weapons resembles bitcoin and the flashy superhero that dies resembles altcoinsin this analogy what is bitcoin’s gun the gun is the layered solutions being built on top of bitcoin such as the lightning network this results in a decentralized and unbreakable foundation on top of which scaling solutions can be built making bitcoin the most unstoppable monetary force the world has ever seenscaling solutions such as lightning will be the tool that allows bitcoin to surpass this level of becoming a means of exchange one could argue that transactions on the lightning network are final settlement though others would argue it technically is not until you’ve confirmed it on the main chain but bitcoiners who use and build on lightning increasingly talk about it as a final settlementtop layer unit of account — hyperbitcoinizationonce more and more individuals use btc to save their wealth merchants accept bitcoin and institutions adopt it as their treasury reserve asset we’re in the end gamethis is when everything in the world has been repriced in bitcoin in replacement of the us dollar this is a longterm process completed via price discovery which has started since day one of bitcoin’s existence as mentioned earlier in complete hyperbitcoinization i highly doubt we’ll be referring to everyday items in their btc terms example  btc instead we’ll just use satoshis to price thingsas the bitcoin black hole continues to suck in more wealth and more merchants start to accept bitcoin as payments for their goods and services hyperbitcoinization is just around the cornerhumans tend to converge on monetary media to save invest and perform economic calculation there only needs to be one as using multiple currencies complicates economic calculation and delays the development toward a unified monetary system bitcoin achieves the unit of account uoa status for everyone globally while simultaneously becoming the most desirable asset to own which only encourages more people to continue using it as their store of value sov and medium of exchange moeall five levels of this pyramid create a positive feedback loop that strengthens bitcoin in every aspect
