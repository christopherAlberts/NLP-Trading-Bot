as tesla buys  billion in bitcoin bny mellon expands custodial services to include bitcoin and crypto assets and mastercard follows visa and paypal in facilitating cryptocurrency transactions the bitcoin price has reached record highs — yet again — breaking over once again in the spotlight bitcoin has reignited arguments over the reasons for its eventual rise or fall such arguments frequently proceed from data facts or other material “realities” we contend that a thorough analysis however must also think about bitcoin in its immaterial form as an object of faith or what is the more secularized versions of faith belief and trustwhile certain commentators have examined the relationship between bitcoin and faith their work typically either disparages “the bitcoin faithful” as unthinking cultists or denotes bitcoin as a uniquely “faithbased asset” we would like to remind our readers that while faith in bitcoin sometimes inspires fanaticism and sometimes inspires incredulity during dinner conversations the faith that sustains the price of bitcoin similarly sustains the price of other asset classes at a foundational levelmore broadly human life is shaped and driven by faith faith can motivate people to such extremes that they willingly sacrifice their lives or wellbeings even beyond the paradigm of religious martyrdom faith motivates one’s sacrifice for a leader a company or an ideaconsider faith in the idea of freedom it motivates one to sacrifice one’s own life to support a revolution faith in the sanctity of freedom of speech motivated the staff of charlie hebdo to risk their lives in defending it a quixotic faith in freedom from government oppression motivates antimaskers to throw caution to the wind furthering a deadly pandemicat the same time faith quietly sustains everyday practices most of us for example visit a bank teller or atm confident that money will be available for withdrawal implicitly understanding that by design our banking system lacks the reserves to allow every depositor to withdraw all of their money at once such is the faith that sustains market economies faith one of our “animal spirits” as john maynard keynes memorably put it dictates market movements as much as — sometimes to the detriment of — rational calculationfaith in the intrinsic value of gold — which once sustained the now defunct gold standard — escapes rational calculation ardent supporters of gold believe that the intrinsic value of gold — along with its purportedly fixed supply — resists debasement during political unrest or monetary inflation such belief elevates gold’s ability to resist debasement into a metaphysical character that transcends historical circumstances a moment’s reflection — or perhaps an attempt to trade gold with extraterrestrials — would reveal that gold has little intrinsic value beyond what people agree upon a spacefaring extraterrestrial civilization — or an elon musk — with the means to excavate infinite amounts of gold from asteroids would surely see limited value in gold beyond its potential in facilitating interstellar trade with natives — such as peter schiff — who remain awestruck by its shininess and the socalled “intrinsic value” of the yellow metallike gold bitcoin too has little intrinsic value — as its detractors correctly note — and its ability as a store of value resistant to debasement rather depends on the will of its believers which — as its detractors invariably fail to note — is no different from how the value of other assets are determinedtoday believers in bitcoin predominantly see it as a store of value or digital gold before this narrative came to prominence however believers in bitcoin conceived of it primarily as a means to escape the shortcomings of centralized financial institutions bitcoin in the words of the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin satoshi nakamoto is a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust bitcoin does not eliminate the need for trust altogether as nakamoto must have realized but rather redistributes trust from a central authority to a network of actors who believe in the superiority of using blockchain technology to decentralize the validation of transactions recorded on a shared public ledgerin the end bitcoin may not become the precise peertopeer electronic cash system that nakamoto envisioned still belief in blockchain technology has opened the door to subsequent blockchain projects — including earlier projects such as litecoin and ethereum and more recent ones such as algorand cardano and polkadot — whose widespread adoption will likewise not depend on their updated technical advantages alone but will rather depend on a cultivation of collective faith in decentralized blockchain technologythat young people have expressed the greatest faith in the decentralized cryptocurrency space inaugurated by bitcoin should not be a surprise having lived through the  financial crisis they viscerally experienced the shortcomings of centralized financial institutions having grown up immersed in smartphones and social media moreover they intuitively seek digital solutions to problems and readily believe that bitcoin overcomes the physical limitations of a solid metal bar of gold — albeit a shiny one at that — precisely because bitcoin has the advantages of a digital technology this new trend in belief is motivating many institutional investors to turn to bitcoin as a store of value and only time will tell if this trend leads bitcoin to supplant gold as a reserve asset while the merits of bitcoin can be justified with respect to data blockchain technology and regulation among other aspects we ask the critical question for its widespread adoption are you a believer in
