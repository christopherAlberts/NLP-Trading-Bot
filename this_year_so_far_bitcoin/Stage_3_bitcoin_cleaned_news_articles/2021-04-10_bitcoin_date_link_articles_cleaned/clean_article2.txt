are you interested in bitcoin cryptobtc but dont know where to begin or do you feel completely lost when it comes to the basics of the digital currency in this fool live interview recorded on march  senior analyst john rotonti and lead analyst of motley fool deutschland bernd schmid cover a wide range of topics to help answer any questions bitcoin beginners might havejohn rotonti fools im john rotonti kicking off our bitcoin theme day on motley fool live and im here with bernd schmid the lead analyst from motley fool deutschland welcome berndbernd schmid hi john and thanks for pronouncing my name correctlyrotonti i try because people butcher my last name all the time so its something that i try to be cognizant of bernd lets just get started with what is bitcoinschmid well i look at bitcoin there are so many different answers you can give to this simple question and it really depends on what youre looking at it but if you want to understand exactly from a basic you dont have any clue youve never heard the term i would describe it as its a network of computers who are all running the same software and running the same database and the database essentially stores transactions in terms of you can send stuff with digital money around lets call it like this these computers this network they are ensuring the security of the network and then making sure that transactions are valid also in the process of doing that theyre creating this money called bitcoin yeah i think thats a good way to frame thisrotonti awesome so its digital money or digital currency that runs off of a network of computers if someone was to ask you how does bitcoin work would that be your answer that its this network of computers and thats the foundation of how it worksschmid yeah i think so i think you can call it currency there is a lot of arguments what is the currency and so on but for the sake of argument or for simplicity lets think of it as a currency what do you want to do with it you can make transactions on this network and you have a ledger which tells you what is the balance essentially of everybodys money like who has how much of it and also securing and making sure that all this data is consistent how does it work its essentially everybody can send transactions to this network and then you have people they are called not people its computers theyre called miners theyre trying to validate is this a valid transaction does it come from somebody who has this amount of bitcoin is it really this person who can do it who is it sending it to and if they come to the conclusion yes its a valid transaction they will add this transaction to the database and this database maybe one thing because probably many people have had to turn blockchain and bitcoin is essentially the state its essentially a database based on the blockchain and a blockchain really does or is what the name says its a chain of blocks essentially every block from the original contains new transactions essentially right now you have a number of blocks im not sure where we are right now a couple of  blocks if you make new transactions the miners come in they validate transactions and then theyre adding allnew valid transactions to this chain as a new blockrotonti a couple of terms you used i want to ask you more about first is you said the database and the ledger are those the same thingschmid yesrotonti ok just wanted to make sure thats the blockchain its in your database or a ledger so those are synonymous then you also said you have bitcoin miners which are verifying the transaction so my followup is how do you mine bitcoin what is happeningschmid thats great yeah miners are essentially the integral part of this network of computers so theyre part of this network how it works is a miner they earn money essentially they earn bitcoin by validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain about how it works is you or i whoever creates new transactions were sending this essentially to this network the miners are collecting all these new transactions and then they are trying to create this new block this trying to create a new block is actually quite a difficult thing essentially what you need to do to create this new block a valid block you need to solve the puzzle a mathematical puzzle and the miners are specialized to solve these puzzles essentially youre creating all these new transactions lets say its  transactions youre trying to solve this mathematical puzzle which is very specific and once you have solved it you can say oh great ive got the solution here the solution you are sending it to the network and then all the other miners they can validate like is the solution the correct one this validation process its very easy if you can see in an instant by a simple calculation whether this solution that this miner claims to have found is the correct one for the transaction you wanted to validate or not if everybody essentially agrees yes this is the correct solution then this block is added to the blockchain you have extended the blockchain and the miner who has successfully solved this puzzle will get the reward which is new bitcoins being created currently exactly  bitcoinrotonti question that just came to my mind you may or may not know the answer to this are there public companies that are bitcoin miners can i buy stock in a bitcoin minerschmid theoretically you could actually do it yourself you can buy a piece of hardware you can even run it on your laptop this actually worked up until a couple of years ten years ago bitcoin was still in the beginning it was created around  i think beginning  if not mistaken it was still very easy to solve this puzzle but what essentially happens the difficulty of this puzzlesolving algorithm or the difficulty of the puzzle its adjusted based on how many people want to try to solve this puzzle of course since you get that i mentioned that you get six bitcoin or  bitcoin which right now has a value of more than  you can imagine that everybody would like to have this and solve the puzzle of course people try to extend the hardware you buy as much hardware as you can afford and think its still economic to do that and this is essentially what is happening so yes there are actually public companies theyre buying a lot of hardware and theyre participating in this mining process i have to admit i dont remember the name i know theres a canadian company you can look it up which is a pure bitcoin mining company you can buy shares in itrotonti fantasticschmid yeahrotonti awesome so how do i buy bitcoin what do i need to doschmid yeah thats a great question and also there are many different answers i think the easiest way i would do it i would really like to own the bitcoin itself you can go to a socalled exchange its not like a new york stock exchange but it functions a bit similarly essentially you can create an account with them coinbase would be one of them probably many people have heard it or krakencom there are many exchanges some are more trustworthy some are less i would always go for the bigger ones so you go to coinbase or kraken you create an account there and then you can send your dollars there your fiat currency you can send it there via credit card or bank wire then essentially like if you buy a stock you say i want to buy this many bitcoin and click buy and then there we go they will add it to your coinbase wallet or account so to sayrotonti okay so that was my next question what is a bitcoin wallet its just your account at the exchangeschmid in this case yeah so a bitcoin wallet lets start with the basic its essentially your access to your bitcoin your money how it actually works is you can think of it as a bank account its never a perfect analogy if you try to compare it with a lets call it legacy financial system but for the sake of understanding i think it works well you think of it you have a bank account and then you have a bank account number and you have a personal identification number with which you can verify that you can access this bank account the wallet is essentially a device it can be a software running on your computer on your mobile phone or theres also hardware wallets its like usb sticks these sticks they contain your bank account number its called public address in the bitcoin jargon and your personal identification number which only you should know this is the private key essentially the wallet has these two things so if you have the wallet you know your public number your public key and your private key your bank account number and your personal identification number and via this you can access essentially the bitcoin which are stored under this addressrotonti yeah and you dont want to forget your password you dont want to forget your private id rightschmid no thats exactly the thing if you lose your private key your bitcoins are lost thats what everybody says there are some security mechanisms thats a whole topic we could discuss for  minutes and im probably not the best person to do it there are different ways to secure these things but its not like with the bank theres a big difference you cannot call bitcoin and say hey i lost my key please help me to restore my bitcoinrotonti rightschmid i want to add one thing many people consider this important is if you buy it via these exchanges kraken or coinbase its actually not your wallet but how they generally work is they have one big wallet where all the bitcoin are stored with the ones you buy the ones i buy everybody who buys them on coinbase and theyre stored in one wallet its essentially the coinbase wallet coinbase makes internally sure via their own database that you have access to the amount of bitcoins youve ever bought you dont really own them if you leave them on coinbase thats why many people argue and i think id do the same you can buy or download your own wallet and always transfer it from kraken or coinbase to your own wallet so you really own them yourselfrotonti what is the grayscale bitcoin trust otcgbtc and how is that different from buying the actual bitcoin through coinbase or another exchangeschmid grayscale is essentially a trust or its a fund which buys in and the shares of this fund are traded in the stock exchange i think its new york stock exchange you can go to your broker and buy stocks in this trust essentially shares in this trust by this way you have exposure to bitcoin because you know that this trust is backed by bitcoin whats different is you only trade the shares of this trust and the shares that might trade above the value of the bitcoin thats actually owned by this trust and i think currently theyre even trading below the value its called net asset value you get actually quite good exposure to the bitcoin price movement to it not exact but if you just want to get exposure to bitcoin see how it feels the price swings that you experience you can do that but you dont own the bitcoin yourself you cannot call grayscale and say can you please send me my bitcoin if you want to use the bitcoin you cannot do it you essentially would have to sell the shares in this trust get your money back and then use your money for whichever you want to do thats the main difference if you have the bitcoin in your wallet you can do something with the bitcoinrotonti fantastic if i were to buy shares in the bitcoin trust today and in  years bitcoin was much much higher if that happened i would benefit from that from owning the shares in the bitcoin trustschmid yeahrotonti in grayscaleschmid exactlyrotonti if i hold the shares throughout that period and bitcoin is much higher in the future then i did have good exposureschmid yesrotonti okschmid thats rightrotonti fantastic what are the risks and opportunities to investing in bitcoinschmid so this depends on the belief and i think later today you will hear a lot of people talking about opportunities and things will come up like a whole new financial system which is being based on bitcoin i personally think something like this is actually quite likely to happen this is how i think about it you get an option on investing into this new financial system which might be created around bitcoin not only bitcoin lets call it cryptocurrency in general the benefits or the opportunities are quite high because if this really happens you could imagine that the value of bitcoin is going much higher right now its about one billion us dollars i think the market cap of bitcoinrotonti trillion is that right one trillionschmid sorry yes im german and in german its actually in a billion but the billion and trillion is different of courserotonti so us dollars market cap around a trillionschmid it is important of course  trillion but just to get a reference for example gold right now i think you can think of bitcoin might be something like a digital gold thats how you can compare just to get a sense of what the value could be the value of all the gold which has been mined historically im not  sure but its about  billion only this would be a  from now but potentially bitcoin could be biggerrotonti wowschmid as i mentioned before i consider it just as a call option so that means you have the option that this happens but the risk is that bitcoin will not be the center of this whole thing and it might be completely valueless in a couple of years i think this risk is still there so you could lose all your money as wellrotonti interesting to think several decades ago gold was like the basis of the us financial system and then we got off the gold standard but if this is digital gold that there is a call option thereschmid yeah thats how i see it you have to talk to other people i think later today you will hear some people think of it that bitcoin might become the pristine collateral that you could own essentially right now the most pristine collateral that you could own as a bank or a big company is us bonds but if you now look at the market cap of all bonds which i think goes into the hundreds of trillions if im not mistaken its even much bigger and some people think that these dimensions could happen i dont know if this is likely if this is possible i think anything is possible i dont know if its likely a lot of things might happen in the coming yearsrotonti can you discuss the scarcity factor arent there like a maximum number of bitcoins allowedschmid yesrotonti why does that matter how does that factor inschmid the software essentially that i was mentioning in the very beginning which all these notes this network is running this has defined there will be  million bitcoins created and then it will be finished they are created by this mining process i described earlier every time you mine a new block is being created which happens on average every  minutes  new bitcoins are being created theres an algorithm which reduces this number every four years more or less until i think its in about  years when no more bitcoins are going to be mined this will be when you reach the  million bitcoin and thats it so why is this important or why is this the deal i think right now the main deal about it is that this is the argument for people saying look this is something scarce something which is scarce has a certain value look at gold the amount of new gold that is being dug out of the ground every year is about  of the gold that has been dug out of the ground historically it is relatively scarce actually theres somebody under the pseudonym planb who has created a model its called stocktoflow a stocktoflow is what i just described how much stock do you have and how much flow of new supply is coming in for gold this would be  per year i think for silver its in the  range for bitcoin the  bitcoin per block it actually amounts also to about what gold is right now  per year and people ascribe value to it i think this was a long story i couldve made a shorter but to bring the point home is people use this as an argument look this is scarce this has value theres a finite supply of it you cannot just create it out of thin air like us dollars thats why its useful buying that you will later hear i think today if you listen to michael saylor of microstrategy he will i think bring home this pointrotonti i personally own stock in square and tesla both those companies have invested in bitcoin theyve bought some bitcoin as part of their business model or to keep on their balance sheet if i want exposure to bitcoin do i have adequate exposure indirectly by owning tesla and square or should i just go buy some bitcoinschmid i would say it like this it depends what else you own in your portfolio and how much exposure you want to have to bitcoin but generally i dont have the exact numbers in mind i would look at the market cap of square and tesla i think for tesla its also almost a trillion or a couple of hundred billions right nowrotonti its high yeahschmid its very highrotonti six hundred billion  million something like thatschmid great so  thats easy i think they own  billion of bitcoin so the market cap is help me out with that  times higher than the number of bitcoin they own its about zero point something percent of exposure that you have to tesla stock for square im not sure about the number but thats probably similar essentially if you want to own tesla anyway and youre happy with like its still a call option that you own if you trust that actually tesla keeps this bitcoin on their balance sheet which i dont know whether its going to happen or notrotonti thats a good pointschmid its certainly something i would considerrotonti there are other cryptocurrencies one of the ones that i hear the most about is ethereum cryptoeth what are the differences between bitcoin and ethereum or bitcoin and other cryptocurrenciesschmid this is a great question and very difficult to answer nonetheless for me i am an engineer actually and even now im trying to frame it from an investment perspective ethereum is also based on a blockchain im not sure if you could call it the cryptocurrency if its a currency or not what is a currency ethereum was designed about  years ago i think   if im not mistaken based on the idea bitcoin is great but i would like to make this programmable for example i would like to make an automatic program a code which is like you want to borrow me some bitcoin we have to orally agree and we have to sign an agreement or something like this the creator for ethereum was thinking hey why dont we just make this as a code on the blockchain when both people agree to borrow bitcoin that this will be recorded on the blockchain and the transfer happens automatically so the whole process will be automated i think this was the main idea behind ethereum and ethereum is actually more like a platform its a platform for building such kind of contract like i was just describing like lending contracts or you could build decentralized exchanges like completely automated like you have an exchange which is running just based on code on the ethereum blockchain so to say this is what ethereum was designed for you could theoretically do the same thing with bitcoin or these things could be delivered with bitcoin the bitcoin community the guys who run the notes right now at least they want to keep bitcoin basic they dont want to add functionality so bitcoin is just useful currently as buying it storing it and transferring it to somebody else you cannot do much more with it on the bitcoin networkrotonti if ethereum is programmable and its a platform to build other things on top of but bitcoin currently doesnt have that functionality what is the use case is it just as an asset to own is that the best use case right now for bitcoinschmid of bitcoinrotonti yesschmid yes exactly so i say the same thing as michael saylor if you want to own cash or you dont want to be exposed to stocks too much or something you want to have some alternative or see it really as a call option for this financial system thats being created i think bitcoin is just the way at least to start bitcoin i see it as a store of value you store this value and this value still highly fluctuates a lot theres a high volatility in bitcoin i think its going to be going forward so its not a fixed value that youre going to store but if you believe that this is something that could develop into something long term this is how i would see bitcoin as a store of this value that can be createdrotonti so bitcoins price has skyrocketed recently i think its somewhere around  us per coin is it too late for investors to get inschmid i dont think so i personally dont buy it anymore it always depends when you get in i look at it from a portfolio perspective but i think how i look at it what could happen to bitcoin with shortterm or in the longerterm the one thing i mentioned before is the  trillion market cap compare it to what bitcoin might be in the future i think a very likely use case is bitcoin could be the digital gold then it could still  from today until whenever this might happen or it could like i mentioned if it replaces more than just gold the value could theoretically be even higher i think its the best way to get at least the gauge of could this thing be worse its certainly not too late and this is what i want to mention based on historical cycles theres about a fouryear cycle which bitcoin has and bitcoin has actually dropped every four years by about rotonti where are we in that cycle do you know where we are in that cycle year two year threeschmid yes actually the pool part of the cycle is quite short i think its about a year dont fix like im not  sure but we are like in the middle of same in the beginning to middle actually i have a chart what i did and actually planb who i mentioned before he does as well i did it myself i chartered the last two cycles and the average of the last two cycles right now and the last two cycles you have from the start of the cycle about a  to  in terms of price movement so from whatever from  to  for last time i think the top was about  at the cycle started with around between five and  so if you account the  you would be somewhere between  and  thats where this can go into the cycle even when we talked about this cycle i personally if you think the tupperware we reached in the same timeframe like last two cycles shifted it will be reached about midtoend or begin midend two to three times increase of bitcoin until the toughest being reached in a couple of months but then be aware you never know whats going to go you dont know if the top is here maybe even sooner and there might likely i think there will be a drop by  at some point of time myself i still believerotonti thats fascinating bernd and i love how you scale it by comparing it to real gold because if this is the digital gold and its currently got a  trillion market cap i think you said so far weve mined about seven to  trillion worth of gold right so if theres a potential  run from here potentiallyschmid you know if you look at it from a value investors perspective you actually know thats tough actually only goes to the value of actually has it always overshoots and undershoots so its quite likely that you go even beyond that you just never know when all these things are going to happen but one thing is certain or relatively certain is that we will have very high volatility you might be down  in a short amount of time you have to stomach these kind of things and considered if you invest into itrotonti for sure we have probably time for one or two more questions bernd what is a nonfungible token or nft what is the connection between cryptocurrencies and nftsschmid yeah nft is essentially a token you can call bitcoin also a token and bitcoin is not really fungible but whats the fungibility means fungibility means you can have one bitcoin i have one bitcoin and it actually doesnt matter which bitcoin we have you can argue this goes into to a different direction but you argue that actually bitcoin its not really fungible thats not the point for us thats considered i dont care if you own bitcoin a mine bitcoin it became exchanges i have to say in value a nonfungible token is a the thing that already exist once so they cant be anything behind it i think its really crazy whats going on right now in this space its probably even a hype but theres like digital artist that create like images or some kind of gifts small movies or something like this and they sell this on the blockchain so to say for whoever is going to get most countries ahead you will be the owner of this thing i just created this thing is the nonfungible token if you buy it with your  or bitcoin address or just whatever will be you will be recorded on the blockchain and you will be the owner of this token you own this and the conduct to blockchainers is recorded on the blockchain so in this database so you can be identified as the owner and if you can prove youre the owner and everybody knows youre an owner i think the best analogy to the real world this or the analog world is art you know theres one mona lisa if you own it if you can prove that you own it and you can sell it i mean this has some value to you i think its the same with these nfts somebody probably subscribed some value to whatever is being credit because he likes it for whatever reason im not an art person so i personally im not into this but some people consider this digital art as something unique that want to ownrotonti that fantastic and i heard you mentioned ethereum in there once again sort of referencing how a ethereum can be a platform because these nfts are being ethereum is being used correctschmid to be honest im not sure on which blockchain this is running i just assume its ethereum because its mostly used even though i think ethereum is not the most efficient one theres much better ones out there i know another blockchain theta for example is one of my favorite once they also create its also a platform so to say they also create this space where you can create these nfts and trade them in the end so theres a lot of blockchains and this space is developing so fast its really tough to keep up with it it could be ethereum but they run often lets say ethereum like blockchain in the end and this is i think where will go and has to go in the end if you buy in this digital art youre like something i think the nba is doing selling certain slam dunks they sell these and you could be the owner of this for you is usually you actually dont care on which blockchain this is being recorded as long as we can prove that youre the ownerrotonti awesome and in about  and  seconds that we have remaining what are you watching going forward what are you monitoring regarding bitcoin or cryptocurrencyschmid all right so i personally im looking into the adoption being increasing thats a really great study by a guy called  hes an exhedge fund manager sorry i think i will go probably  seconds beyond these  seconds we still haverotonti no problemschmid but i think this is quite important what is the value of such a network so in the very beginning first question i described this like a network of computers but its also a network of people who use this network right as the more people use bitcoin the more value it has the network effect essentially and actually you can show  has shown that that actually the market cap of these blockchains it actually trends quite well with the number of users   i forgot the name law  law its fascinating so what im that i mentioned it because what im watching is actually how good is the adoption of bitcoin going forward are more people using it this is all transparent you can look at how many active addresses are there how many people are using this blockchain im looking at how fast this is growing is this growing at all one very specific thing is im also looking at how is it being adopted now by institutional investors like companies are there going to be more companies like tesla microstrategy square buying bitcoin for the sake of having a store of value on their balance sheet i think if bitcoin should have at least a mediumterm use case and this going to be successful mediumterm this is something that theyre supposed to be happening within the next one two three years continuously if this wouldnt happen like this there wouldnt be more companies or there would be more doubts in the next say two years than i would become quite skeptical about bitcoinrotonti bernd this was fantastic thank you so much for sharing this half hour with us and telling us all about bitcoin and cryptos and nfts and everything that youve been studying over the past years thank you berndschmid it was a pleasure john thanks for the great questions i hope my answers can be useful for most of you guys listeningrotonti for sure byebyeschmid thanks john see you
