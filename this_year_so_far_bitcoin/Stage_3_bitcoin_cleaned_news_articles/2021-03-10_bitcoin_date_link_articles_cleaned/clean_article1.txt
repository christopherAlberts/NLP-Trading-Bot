what is bitcoinbitcoin is one of the earliest and definitely the most famous cryptocurrency it is different than fiat money issued by governments in that there is no central authority behind it rather it is governed by a set of algorithmic rules regarding the amount of bitcoins in circulation which can only increase over time very slowly the verification of transactions and the way in which ownership is registeredwhat are its advantages over money created by central banksmoney serves three purposes first as a medium of exchange to make or receive payments second as a unit of account to establish the value of different things in a common measure and third as a store of value to keep savings or surpluses bitcoin right now is a very limited form of payment because relatively few individuals companies or governments accept it as such it plays no role as a unit of account but can be seen as a store of value in the sense that it is an asset that can be purchased and whose price may be maintained or even increase over timewhat is driving the price increasegiven that it does not yield a dividend and that it has no intrinsic value unlike gold the price of bitcoin is purely determined by supply and demand the supply is constrained by design and thus the price is determined by demand the more demand the higher the price which is what has happened over the last few monthshow volatile is itbitcoin is very volatile its price depends mostly on demand if current owners of bitcoin perceive or anticipate issues then their sales can drive the price down government or central bank regulation can also drive its value down if it is restrictive the fed for instance has come out strongly against unregulated cryptocurrencies several times over the last few years triggering a sudden devaluation the price of bitcoin is among the most volatilehow do you store trade and spend itone needs to open an account on a fintech platform or increasingly a bank or financial institution and buy bitcoins with some other currency for example dollars the bitcoin market rests on the socalled blockchain which is a digital registry or ledger which records all transactions this is a decentralized registry in the sense that it resides on all the computers that are part of the network given the absence of a centralized authority bitcoin transactions are verified by ‘miners’ who get a commission in exchange for corroborating that a transaction has taken place one can sell bitcoins on the same platforms it is accepted as a form of payment by a small fraction of all merchants in the world one huge problem intrinsic to the design of bitcoin is that if the amount of cryptocurrency in circulation increases very slowly it is impossible that it can become a major player in payments because the global economy is so huge thus the goal of achieving stability through a limitation of the supply interferes with the putative goal of becoming a currency that rivals the dollar or the euro unless more bitcoins are issued this cryptocurrency cannot possibly serve as a form of payment used by billions of peoplewhat does the future hold
