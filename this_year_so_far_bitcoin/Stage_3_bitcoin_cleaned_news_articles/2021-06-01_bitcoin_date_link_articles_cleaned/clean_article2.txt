editors note be careful with cryptocurrency bitcoin — and the entire crypto market — is highly volatile and we do not recommend any particular cryptocurrencyfor many people bitcoin is cryptocurrency ask them what is bitcoin and you might not get the right answer — but theyd at least have heard of itthats hardly surprising because although bitcoin is far from the only cryptocurrency it was the first to be created and it remains by some distance the most famous and the most valuableafter several years of gradual albeit turbulent growth bitcoin exploded into the mainstream in late  when its price skyrocketed to more than  per coin… and then rapidly deflated the socalled “bitcoin bubble” had burst and many people believed that it was a fad that would never regain steambut bitcoin kept lingering in the background gradually regaining ground as a wider market of similar cryptocurrencies and related financial services emerged amidst the economic uncertainty of the  pandemic bitcoin soared in price once more — and this time around it has done a better job of holding onto that valuemeanwhile the technology behind bitcoin known as blockchain has become the financial and tech industries new buzzword companies are rushing to adopt the tech to rethink classic systems and invent new ones while investors scramble to get in on the next big thingall of that has given bitcoin a mainstream profile it has never before enjoyed — and attracted many potential investors who would never have dreamed of buying into crypto a year or two backif that describes you then be careful though bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies have seen dramatic gains in value in recent months the market remains highly volatile bitcoin investing is not for the faint of heart and were not here to tell you whether to invest in it — or in any cryptocurrencyinstead this piece is a guide to help you better understand bitcoin both its benefits and its risksbitcoins slight recovery after the crypto crash of last month appears to have stalled as of june  the coins value is down by around  in the past  hours and  in the past weekbitcoin expert nikolaos panigirtzoglou of jp morgan warned that the cryptocurrency could still fall furtherbitcoin may soon be available to purchase from hundreds of us banks via a partnership between nydig and fintech firm fidelitywhat is bitcoinbitcoin is a decentralized digitalonly currency rather than having a central monetary authority a peertopeer computer network keeps track of bitcoin transactions and creates additional bitcoins through a process called miningbitcoin users and their transactions are pseudonymous there are no international exchange rates to figure out and theres no need for middlemen to collect feesbitcoin was created in  in the wake of the nearcollapse of the global financial establishment it happened soon after an individual or group using the name satoshi nakamoto posted a paper online discussing the idea of a decentralized digital currency free from interference by governments and financial institutions nakamoto created the online bookkeeping system to record and track bitcoin transactions and mined the first bitcoinsthe software to create track hold and exchange bitcoins is opensource so it can be used for freebitcoin price what is the current bitcoin valueas of this writing the price of a single

that monthmomentum began building gradually again with the price trading between  and  across most of  before growing from  on it increased rapidly over the following  months to peak at about  in middecember  amidst a groundswell of mainstream attentionbitcoin’s price crashed soon thereafter as the market was not ready to support such wildly speculative prices but it didn’t go away bitcoin enthusiasts continued to “hodl” hold on for dear life in the hopes that their digital coins would again prove immensely valuable and the wider cryptocurrency market grewimage credit coinmarketcapfinally amidst the  pandemic in  demand for bitcoin skyrocketed once more the price climbed quickly in the late months of the year nearly hitting  and then blasted off in early  setting an alltime high above  in april however its value has declined significantly since then due in part to unease over the environmental impact of mining impending chinese regulation and more the price dipped to around  in late may down nearly  from that alltime high but has started rebounding as of this writing and is currently at around bitcoin’s constant price fluctuations are due in part to its capped amount of  million individual bitcoins and to its perceived value on the markethow do you buy bitcoinanyone can buy bitcoin — although as we said above you should be wary of doing so many people purchase it through an exchange such as coinbase or binance which will hold your coins within your account on the service you can also move your holdings to an external wallet if you please cash app venmo and robinhood are also popular ways to buy bitcoin although note that as of this writing robinhood does not let you spend bitcoin or transfer it to an external walletif you want to control your own bitcoin and cryptocurrency holdings then you’ll need to set up a bitcoin wallet typically on your computer or mobile device some of the most popular wallet services are trust wallet mycelium and electrum most wallet services will walk you through the process of setting up your wallet more on this belowcentralized exchanges such as coinbase and binance require personal information to register your account so that you can buy bitcoin and will verify your identity using a driver’s license passport or similar youll also need to share your bank account information note also that many credit card issuers in the us and uk will not let you use a credit card to buy cryptocurrencyimage credit gdaxcomanother way to buy bitcoin is through a decentralized exchange such as uniswap or pancakeswap these are funded by liquidity from the community and run on automated “smart contracts” and they dont require personal identifying information or even an account that said they also dont let you use fiat currency like us dollars from a bank account or debit card — so you will already need to own cryptocurrency acquired from another exchange or walletits worth noting that you dont need to buy or transact an entire bitcoin — pretty important given not only the surging price but also the limited number of bitcoins that will ever be mined there are  million satoshis or sats within a single bitcoin and smallervalue transactions are sometimes handled in satoshis as a result it’s also possible to buy say  worth of bitcoin at an exchange and get a tiny fraction of a single bitcoin in your walletis bitcoin a bubblebitcoin may seem like a great investment opportunity but its bubble has burst once before and may do so again bitcoin proponents see it and other cryptocurrencies as the future of currency and trading and point to the rise in public interest in bitcoin — and its gradual acceptance by mainstream financial firms — as evidence of bitcoins inevitabilityhowever many investors believe that bitcoin is still an unknown quantity its exchange rates are extremely volatile and we dont know if a oneday drop will turn into a permanent crash while the price has risen significantly so far in  it has also experienced such a severe drop that its value was nearly halved within a month of setting an alltime high pricebitcoin investing is therefore a risk if youve been drawn in by the promise of untold riches then think again theres absolutely no guarantee on this frontwhat is bitcoin miningbitcoins can be purchased using real money but they can also be generated or mined users generate bitcoins by having their computers solve difficult mathematical algorithms that help verify the creation of new bitcoins in the blockchain — the encrypted ledger that records and registers all bitcoin activity — and the transfer of bitcoins between users the algorithms become progressively more difficult over timeblockchain node operators keep track of all transactions and broadcast new transactions across the host network incrementally adding to the blockchain computers that are participating in the network communicate and agree on updates to the blockchainabout every  minutes a miner whose blockchain updates have been approved and packaged into a block earns  bitcoins when bitcoin first came into being the reward was  bitcoins but the reward amount halves with every  blocks registered equivalent to about four years the last “halving” took place in may the total number of bitcoins that can ever be mined is  million the cap prevents anyone from flooding the market and devaluing the bitcoins already in circulationaccording to blockchaincom which provides realtime updates on bitcoin there are just over  million coins in existence as of this writing or about  of the total number possible the lastever bitcoin is expected to be mined in  based on projected network activitymining bitcoin can be lucrative but it requires upfront investment in robust computer hardware and is not easy to accomplish gone are the days when you could use any old computer to get a piece of the actionsome bitcoin miners rig up chains of highend graphics cards normally

major issue in bitcoin mining according to the cryptocurrency website digiconomist the electricity used by the entire bitcoin global mining apparatus is equivalent to the carbon footprint of libyaonce you have the hardware to mine bitcoin it is typically most efficient to join a bitcoin mining pool in which a group works together to solve a block you can work alone but it will take longer and be less rewarding to be awarded bitcoins miners must be able to verify  of transactions and be the first to compute a  hexadecimal number working in a pool increases the possibilities of receiving an award even if it is sharedfor beginners or those who see mining as a hobby it may be more worthwhile to mine for other cryptocurrencies that have lower hardware requirements than those for mining bitcoinwhat can you buy with bitcoinspending bitcoin isn’t quite as easy as buying the cryptocurrency but we have seen wider adoption over the years often bitcoin holders don’t want to spend their btc given the perceived potential for future gains but some enterprising individuals that want to fully live the crypto lifestyle and avoid fiat currency altogether have done their best to spend only cryptosome companies such as online retailer overstock and travel site expedia  accept bitcoin directly vpn services like nordvpn and expressvpn also accept bitcoin as does coworking service wework  and you can even buy a private jet with bitcoin via aviatrade  and the number of retailers accepting bitcoin has recently expanded thanks to paypal which now allows us users to spend cryptocurrency at

transacting bitcoin when more miners embrace renewable energy sourcesis using bitcoin legalbitcoins arent regulated by any government which raises questions about their legalityin the united states bitcoin use is legal because it isnt a physical form of currency like the dollar were the currency to be given a physical form like a silver dollar the creators would be held guilty of making processing and selling their own currency bitcoins are legal but regulated in canada and mexico and legal in most of europe as well as new zealand and australiain china it is legal for private citizens to hold bitcoin but since  it has not been legal for financial firms to do so bitcoin exchanges were banned in  and the chinese domestic currency the yuan or renminbi cant be used to add or withdraw funds from a bitcoin account in early february  china said it would block access to overseas bitcoin exchanges from within the countrychinese regulators have increased their scrutiny of bitcoin since and in may  banned banks and other financial institutions from offering cryptocurrencyrelated services as a result some firms have also announced plans to stop mining cryptocurrency in the country as well as to halt the sale of mining rigs to consumersimage credit shutterstockthere’s speculation so far in  that india may ban cryptocurrencies with a senior government official telling reuters that the country’s proposed plan would penalize miners and traders india is reportedly looking to launch its own digital national currency insteadaccording to spendmenot bitcoin is currently outright illegal in several countries around the world including bolivia north macedonia algeria egypt and moroccois using bitcoin anonymoususing bitcoin is not  anonymous rather it is pseudonymous as users can employ whatever names and handles they want but because of the fixed and transparent nature of the blockchain accounting system all transactions involving bitcoin are public and anyone can see how many bitcoins are in a given walletbitcoin atms which trade cash for bitcoins or vice versa allow for additional anonymity you could also use multiple wallets or mix bitcoin services to obscure the digital paper trail and there are other practices for hiding identity but in the end nothing is foolproof there are analytics firms and services devoted to linking bitcoin wallets to suspected criminals and government agencies have stepped up their use of such tools and serviceswhat is a blockchainthe blockchain is the distributed digital ledger that documents all bitcoin transactions and is bitcoin creator satoshi nakamotos primary technological innovation it is the only place where bitcoins exist several times every hour new batches of bitcoin transactions called blocks are registered and transmitted over the internet to all hosts of the bitcoin blockchain as of this writing there are nearly  active bitcoin nodes all around the worldwhenever a block is completed it is added to the chain creating a permanent and unalterable record each new block is cryptographically linked to the previous block and changing any recorded block would create a mathematical ripple effect that would be immediately visible to all blockchain hosts because of this the blockchain acts as its own ledger similar to a bookkeeping ledgerbecause the blocks cant be altered in any way users can validate cryptocurrency transactions without need of a third party or outsidestorage source the blockchain prevents a single unit of bitcoin from being used in two different transactions at the same time it also allows users to remain relatively anonymous although bitcoin addresses are permanentbecause it is decentralized and easily verifiable blockchain technology can be used for other purposes — for instance it could be used to share sensitive databases such as gun registries or medical records on a large scale it could also provide a more secure way for traditional financial institutions to operate some blockchain advocates suggest that the technology could enable secure online voting and protect the copyrights of digital music or bookswhat are bitcoin walletsbitcoin transactions are processed through a bitcoin wallet an application that users download and install on their computers or smartphones a purchaser or seller is identified only by his or her digital wallets address a unique string of letters and numbers with a private key another numeric string which only the wallet holder hasthe best crypto wallets can be set up for free and with relative ease meaning consumers can open and close wallets at will to maintain their anonymity one person can have multiple wallets and multiple individuals can control a single walletthere are several types of bitcoin wallets to choose from each with its own set of pros and cons the options includehardware wallets this kind of wallet is an external device specifically designed to hold and manage bitcoins no transaction can take place unless the hardware wallet is connected to a computer or mobile device and access to the bitcoins held within is often protected with a pin code hardware wallets are considered the most secure type of bitcoin wallets as they are “cold storage” when not connected to a computer however unlike software wallets theyre not freeimage credit shutterstockdesktop wallets software is downloaded directly to the computer giving users full control and responsibilitybecause the bitcoin address is kept on the computers storage no one else has access to it however the user must ensure that there is a backup of the drive and must have a security system installed to prevent theft of the bitcoin data if the desktop wallet is corrupted in some way any bitcoins stored there are deleted and irretrievabledesktop wallets come as either fullsize clients or light clients fullsize clients allow the user to host and read a copy of the entire bitcoin blockchain which is almost  today light clients simply provide bitcoin storage and require external sources to read the blockchainmobile wallets these wallets are accessed through an app on your smartphone or tablet they can be easy to use offering touchscreen controls and the ability to scan qrcoded bitcoin addresses but mobile wallets can access only a small portion of the entire bitcoin blockchain and so are considered light clientsonline wallets webbased wallets allow you to manage bitcoins through your browser these wallets are convenient because they can be accessed at any time and anywhere you cant accidentally delete them and you dont have the responsibility of backing up your holdingshowever third parties usually manage online wallets and this involves high levels of trust and means that you have to rely on someone else to handle the security the companies that manage online wallets often also act as bitcoin brokers or exchanges which make money by taking a cut of every transaction they managepaper wallets bitcoin address keys and qr codes are printed on paper or some other medium you dont have to worry about cyberattacks stealing the information because nothing is stored digitally but if the paper is lost or destroyed access to the bitcoins is gone foreverwhat is a bitcoin addressyour bitcoin address works much like a bank account number it is a unique combination of letters and numbers ranging from  to  characters that is used to send and receive bitcoins and is connected to your bitcoin wallet most users have multiple addresses tied to a single pseudonym the key to the bitcoin address is cryptographically linked to the address and only the holder of the address should have that keywhat are bitcoin forksbecause there are so many players involved in mining and using bitcoin there can be disagreement about common rules this has led to forks technical actions that have separated the blockchain into new pathsthere are now more than  bitcoin forks  most of which are still considered active the bestknown forks are bitcoin cash bitcoin gold and bitcoin satoshi vision svbitcoin cash was introduced in the summer of  when miners wanted to move bigger blocks of memory in the blockchain while bitcoin moves at  per block bitcoin cash moves at  this allows for an increase in the rate of transactions in the ledger the bitcoin gold fork occurred in the fall of  and was meant to make it easier to mine money once again bitcoin sv was forked from bitcoin cash a year later and is said to be more in line with creator satoshi nakamoto’s original vision for the cryptocurrencywhats the link between bitcoin and crimebitcoin is often the currency of choice in cybercrime transactions including the selling of goods such as drugs guns child pornography malware and phony antivirus software as well as the selling of services such as botnet rentals and the payment of ransomware ransoms some experts believe the growth of bitcoin and the parallel growth of ransomware are directly relatedransomware and scareware existed before cryptocurrency of course but the introduction of bitcoin has made it more difficult for authorities to follow the thread of payments back to reallife accounts that said there are other coins such as monero that are even more difficult to trace and have become popular for ransomware attackscybercriminals know that their targets are becoming savvier about ransomware and that theyre increasingly taking steps to avoid paying the bitcoin ransom to retrieve their dataunsurprisingly criminals have reacted to this by discovering new ways to earn bitcoins — for instance infecting websites and online ads with malware that turns the computers of visiting browsers into cryptocurrencymining machinesadministrators of some websites are also doing this directly to create an additional revenue stream and its not clear whether it is illegal to do so without informing site visitorswhats the deal with attacks on bitcoin exchangescriminals have set their sights on bitcoins and have attacked bitcoin exchanges over the years arguably the bestknown attack was the one on the mt gox exchange until then the worlds largest bitcoin exchange in the exchange suffered a series of ddos attacks in february of that year causing lags in trading and locking users out of their accounts shortly afterwards mt gox discovered that thieves had stolen some  million in bitcoin from the exchange some of the money had been skimmed off over the previous three years another chunk was stolen during the ddos attacks by the end of that month the ceo had shut down the exchange site and declared bankruptcycyberattacks on bitcoin exchanges are becoming more common especially as the currency increases in value phishing attacks to steal user or administrator passwords are the most common attack vector but cybercriminals are also going after mobile wallets and targeting weaknesses in the blockchain malware written for windows and mac also looks for and steals bitcoins from infected computersbecause of the nature of the currency once a bitcoin is stolen its nearly impossible to recoverwhat other cryptocurrencies compete with bitcoinimage credit shutterstockbitcoin is the bestknown cryptocurrency but it is not the only one in fact coingecko tracks some  different coins with
