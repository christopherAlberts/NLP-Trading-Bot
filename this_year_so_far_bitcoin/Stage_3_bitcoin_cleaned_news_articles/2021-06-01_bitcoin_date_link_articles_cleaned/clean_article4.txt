according to philosopher craig warmke bitcoin is basically batmanwell i may be taking a bit of liberty with warmke’s argumentthis article is excerpted from the node coindesks daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news you can subscribe to get the full newsletter herethe assistant professor of philosophy at northern illinois university and a member of the cryptooriented research collective resistance money has a forthcoming paper that contends bitcoin is a collective story that all participants in the network participate in writingsubscribe to  by signing up you will

on a consensus answerwarmke’s conception of bitcoin as a collective fiction is if nothing else novel in the corpus of explanationsnote that the argument here isn’t saying bitcoin is like a storyhe’s saying it is a story one that happens to also have value in the real world this isn’t so hard to understand as we’ll seebitcoin is a story and bitcoin is the story’s main subject as stories go it’s pretty boring it’s the story of new bitcoin getting issued and then moving from one wallet to another – forever the plot is bitcoin moves around within bitcoin scintillatingthe bitcoin network uses writing code to describe something with no external correspondence and yet it has value that’s fiction as warmke puts it toward the end of the paper “if the chunk of code in the bitcoin blockchain that describes a movement of bitcoin is not itself that movement where does the movement the transaction take place nowhere – or everywhere depending on how you think of it… bitcoin is a fictional substance”in his conception miners are publishers and nodes are referees wallet owners have the right to write but only so long as they have some fictional bitcoin to compose a sentence about and the only thing that sentence can say is how much bitcoin is going to a certain walletbut … fictionso let me give you my way of thinking about warmke’s paper by way of the caped crusader it helps to explain why bitcoin is like batman™ batman is also a fictional object within a story it is an extremely valuable story in fact the  “batman” sparked a global pop culture sensation and netted over  million at the box office the “dark knight” film trilogy was worth  billion in revenue to warner bros at the box office alone and that’s just recent proceeds just from the filmsthe caped crusader has been printing money for its owners across books toys and other media since  beat that satoshiwhat noncomic book fans may not realize is that batman’s value has persisted in part because his story keeps growing much like bitcoin’sthe batman story continues each month all over the pages of dc comics where he appears an impossible number of times in numerous titles new bits of story coming out every weekbob kane and bill finger are credited with inventing batman but his legend has grown as countless writers artists and editors add to the massive batman mythologyeach batman story effectively becomes a bit of “real” history in fact every single thing that happens in any dc comic book is part of the history of the world that batman lives in and those histories frequently bleed into each otheronce a dc superhero comic book is published it becomes canon and any other writer can pick up where that story left off even if done in the pages of a whole other title the termofart in comics for this is “continuity” it’s another way of saying “history of a fictional world”we like a story in which a character surprises us but only if it surprises us in a way that still feels rightin other words writers and artists have something like writing rights in the collective story of a comic book universe but also like in bitcoin there are limitationswriters and artists are like the wallets in warmke’s conception adding sentences to the batman ledgerbut editors are like bitcoin nodes their job is in part to guard against continuity errors in batman’s history making sure a new story doesn’t contradict an old one for example and to make sure consensus gets maintained around batmanthere are an infinite number of batman stories but that infinite set is not unboundedif a writer came in one day with a script where bruce wayne decided to open a flower shop rather than fight crime i would expect the editor would reject that storysuch a story one might say would break consensus about the character of batman we like a story in which a character surprises us but only if it surprises us in a way that still feels right that’s the consensus part “batman caped chrysanthemum curator” would surprise readers in a bad wayfurthering warmke’s framework here obviously dc comics is batman’s publisher his equivalent of a mining network much more centralized diamond comics distributors is his internet the batman distribution networkboth very valuablethis network keeps the thing that is batman™ moving forward a story that keeps growing it’s a much more interesting story than reading the bitcoin ledgerand for different reasons those stories have real value in the real world but they are still storiesat the end of the day this is an ontological argument about what it means for something to exist and warmke has constructed a thoughtprovoking model here that might drive consensus around that “is” question about bitcointhe next time people ask you “what is bitcoin” you can tell them “it’s a story that’s written collectively by all the bitcoin holders it gets more valuable the more people know about it help write it and the longer the story goes on”inevitably they will counter “how does that make sense”to which we are currently prone to saying something like “look money is a collective fiction too” that’s usually taken as sort of a college sophomore level cliché – it rings hollow every time
