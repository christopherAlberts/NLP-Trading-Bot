tuesday june  speaking truth is often unappreciated the answer to “does this make me look fat” is never “yes because you are fat to begin with”as business lawyers one of our most difficult tasks is to discuss weaknesses in a client’s company or business model nobody wants to hear that their baby is uglyin the digital world speaking ill of blockchain or digital currency is the one truthtelling act guaranteed to bring shrieking protests and attacks on the speaker’s intelligence an entire class of people is emotionally and financially bound to success of this technology and a separate class of people is financially invested in keeping them that way they seem to understand that skepticism or apostasy to the gospel of bitcoinblockchain could chip away at public confidence so every suggestion of excessive hype must be met with immediate and angry resistancelet’s concede up front that the blockchain is an interesting option for recording and accounting some types of assets but as my colleague often observed “passing a law encouraging use of the blockchain  is the same as passing a law to encourage excel spreadsheets” the blockchain is an administrative tool with serious limitations and few natural applications it is not now and never will be the worldchanging technology seeping into every corner of our lives that many of its cultists would have you believeand let’s concede that lots of people have made lots of money on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies – just like lots of dutch made gilders on tulips before the mania ended and lots of late  century collectors made dollars hoarding beanie babies before the crash arrived it is difficult not to see the recent spike in dogecoin sales as a working example of the greater fool theory since the dawn of sophisticated investment genuinely enthusiastic people egged on by manipulative immoral people have bid up silly classes of “assets” and made money by getting in early and selling out as the value rose the fact that some people made money in these manufactured bubbles does not mean that the core asset was truly worth anything at allbeing an asset with no inherent value that is being bid up in price does not make that asset a “currency” can you buy lunch coffee a hotel room or a new shirt with dogecoin not easily and only in a few places and you could trade tulips or beanie babies for lunch or a shirt just as simply in most cases at least those latter assets have a separate functionthese digital assets are hyped by hucksters manipulated for the benefit of unscrupulous marketmakers and snatched up on the strength of sheer belief unsupported by logic it is telling that the only significant “currency” application for these assets has been for criminal enterprises looking to hide their activity cryptocurrency is the perfect asset class for our age where huge numbers of credulous people not only believe ridiculous conspiracy theories but they send money to the liars in supportwe have not even discussed the problems digital asset investors might have if the website storing their digital assets closed disappeared or lost all its assets these are not regulated entities and there is no reason to believe they will continue to make the assets available even if you always remember your key for reaching your assets your bank closes and the government insures much of your money if your cryptocrypt closes there is famously nobody backing it up the opposite of bitcoin’s mantra is true – lack of government backing is a bug not a featurebillions of dollars in these digital “currencies” have been lost because the supposed owner couldn’t find the right encryption keys or threw away the computer that held it the value can simply disappear or become unreachable in so many waysin a preview of many law suits likely to follow six months ago the us securities and exchange commission sec charged two executives from ripple labs with selling more than  million in unregistered digital assets the sec a paragon of common sense when it comes to categorizing investments defines “cryptocurrencies” like ripple’s xpr digital asset as unregistered securities the sec complaint alleges that ripple failed to register their offering of xrp and failed alternatively to satisfy any exemption from registration in violation of federal securities laws we were told that cryptocurrencies were an entirely new asset class that couldn’t be regulated we were told wrongearlier this month gary gensler the chair of the sec called on congress to create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges at the moment no regulator is clearly charged with managing them and keeping them safe for investors in congressional testimony gensler noted that naming either the sec or the commodity futures trading commission as direct regulator for crypto exchanges could “instill greater confidence right now there’s not a market regulator around these crypto exchanges and thus there’s really not protection against fraud or manipulation”even cryptocurrency exchange company coinbase has called for regulation of its market an exchange like coinbase takes significant risk when it chooses to list a new crypto asset on its platform if coinbase knew which regulator to consult that risk would reduce considerably coinbase delisted ripple following the sec’s lawsuit prompting a selloff that destroyed more than  of the ripple asset’s value uncertainty in regulation not only allows asset fraud to continue unabated but it shakes the ground exchanges and professional trades stand onaccording to the wall street journal sec commissioner hester peirce “has set out the clearest position within the agency for rules on cryptocurrency issuance he released an updated plan for a “safe harbor” that would exempt digital currencies from most securities regulations during a threeyear development period the plan would allow issuers to develop their networks and let buyers trade new currencies peertopeer subject only to the antifraud provisions of the  securities act” this plan recognized the large sums of money in this system while providing some time to construct an appropriate regulatory regimemuch profit has been created out of thin air in crypto investments many many people have also lost money in predictable ways with many more to follow any time that someone tried to sell you “the future of money” check your wallet to confirm it has not been lifted from your pocket that’s a truth you can rely on
