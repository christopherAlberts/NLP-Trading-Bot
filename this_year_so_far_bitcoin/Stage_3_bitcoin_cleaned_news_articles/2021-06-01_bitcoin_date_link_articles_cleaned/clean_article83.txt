joseph v micallef is a bestselling military history and world affairs author and keynote speaker follow him on twitter josephvmicallefseveral weeks ago a russiabased hacker group called darkside staged a ransomware attack against us pipeline operator colonial pipelineto prevent a virus from spreading throughout their computer network colonials management shut down the pipelines operations the colonial pipeline is a  network that transports approximately  million barrels of gasoline per day  about  of the us east coasts gasoline diesel and jet fuel the suspension of fuel deliveries led to widespread shortages of gasoline which affected  statesat the peak of the crisis more than  gas stations were out of gasoline in some markets up to  of gas stations ran out of fuel although pipeline operations were restarted may  there were still  gas stations that needed fuel as of may ransomware is a form of malicious software or virus that when introduced into an operating system blocks access to the computer system typically by encrypting files to neutralize the virus hackers demand that the company pay a ransom usually in a cryptocurrency to obtain a key that will neutralize the virus and allow the firm to regain control of its operating systemaccording to the fbi darkside is a cybercriminal gang based in russia and eastern europe that operates a business model it describes as ransomware as a service the group announced in august  that it had developed ransomware tools that it would sell to other hacking groupssince then there have been  ransomware attacks that resulted in the theft of more than  terabytes of data it is not clear whether these ransom attacks were staged exclusively by the darkside hacker group or by others using the darkside hacker tools most likely it is a combination of bothfollowing the attack darkside announced that it was dissolving however on may  it disclosed that three more companies a construction company in scotland a renewable energy product reseller in brazil and a technology service reseller in the us had been breached a division of toshibas european unit as well as irelands health service have also been attackedits not clear whether these attacks were staged by darkside by groups affiliated with them or hackers using their tools darkside has historically operated a sophisticated affiliate network where it shares the proceeds of its ransomware with partners that can facilitate its penetration of a victims computer systemcolonial pipeline has confirmed that it paid a ransom of  million to regain control of its computer system its possible that colonial pipeline paid other sums not classified as ransom but it is certain that a ransom was paidaccording to darkside some unknown entity subsequently raided the groups digital wallet where its cryptocurrency was kept and drained its  million contents its not clear who was responsible for taking darksides cryptocurrency some commentators suggested that it was the us government although the biden administration has denied this it might also have been a ruse by darkside to deflect regulatory scrutiny and retaliationthe use of bitcoin to pay the ransom has rekindled concerns that cryptocurrencies pose a threat to us national security both because their use in ransomware attacks could encourage this activity but also more generally because they could potentially undermine the role of the us dollar in the worlds financial systemdigital currency and us national securityto be considered a currency an item must meet three criteria it must simultaneously be a store of value a unit of account and a means of exchangethe us dollar is a currency because it meets all three criteria it is a store of purchasing power ie a store of value fears of inflation notwithstanding it is used to measure net worth or the value of a transaction ie the price of gasoline or bread and it can be exchanged for goods and servicesa digital currencycryptocurrency is defined as a digital asset used as a means of exchange where the ownership record is stored in a ledger in the form of a securely encrypted computerized database which stores transaction records controls the creation of new currency and to verify the transfer of ownership of that currencycurrently there are more than  different digital currencies with an aggregate value of approximately  trillion bitcoin is the best known and the largest in monetary value of the digital currencies representing roughly half of the value of all digital currenciesthe blockchain which is the critical element that allows the exchange of digital currencies without the intervention of third parties or regulators is a digital record of all of the transactions regarding a specific cryptocurrency maintained across several computers that are linked in a peertopeer networkthink of the blockchain as the digital equivalent of title insurance on a house title insurance tracks the chain of ownership in a property from the original land grant through the various owners down to the most recent buyer this verification of the chain of title confirms the legal ownership of the most recent purchaserblockchain does the same thing in an encrypted digital format for any item whether it is a digital currency or a commodity thus for example blockchain can track the chain of title of an item from the original manufacturer through the distributor wholesaler and retailer including all of the shippers in between  up to and including the consumer purchasebitcoin is not quite a fullfledged digital currency it can be a store of value although that value can be highly volatile nor is it yet a means of exchange there are a handful of businesses that will take bitcoin in exchange for goods and service  but most do not until recently tesla would sell you a car priced in bitcoin although it has now suspended that optionin addition there are any number of financial intermediaries such as paypal or square that will allow you to exchange bitcoin for goods and services by converting your bitcoin to cash to pay for a purchasebitcoin is also not yet a unit of account if you requested a mortgage from your local bank and submitted a financial statement in bitcoin or some other digital currency the bank would likely send it back and tell you to submit it in us dollars at this point bitcoin has some of the characteristics of a currency but falls short of being a fullfledged digital currencyhow do digital currencies pose a national security threat to the usthere are three ways in which crypto currencies could impact us national securityfirst bitcoin and other digital currencies are easier to launder than cash ie move around and convert into other assets had darkside asked for cash or for the money to be wired to a foreign bank it would have been far easier to track where the money was goingmoving large quantities of cash without government sanction is difficult just try to buy a car much less a house for cash likewise even if a foreign bank had been willing to accept and process the wire transfer any financial institutions that participated in the transaction without regulatory approval would find themselves frozen out of the swift networkswift stands for society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication legally swift scrl it provides a network that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure standardized and reliable environment a bank frozen out of the swift network could not deal with other banks and would find it impossible to operate internationally or do much more than provide local banking servicesa comparable regulatory structure for digital currencies has not yet evolved more regulation is coming but since digital currencies can be transferred directly through peertopeer networks regulatory agencies may never have the degree of control over digital currencies that they do over electronic financial transactions involving conventional currenciesby making it easier to monetize criminal activity the rise of digital currencies may lead to an increase in criminal activity especially activity like ransomware that can be conducted remotely while any one activity may not rise to the level of a national security threat the possibility of an overall increase in criminality does  especially when those criminal acts are being conducted by foreign bad actors against american companies us government agencies or elements of critical american infrastructuresecondly the creation of digital currencies represents an enormous transfer of wealth take bitcoin for example currently approximately  bitcoins are created each day at the time of this writing bitcoin was trading at approximately  per coin that means  million of bitcoin is made  the term used is mining  each day or approximately  billion a monthin april  for example  of all bitcoin mining occured in china the next five largest bitcoin miners are the us  russia  kazakhstan  malaysia  and iran  cnbc has estimated that chinese bitcoin mining may be as high as  others have suggested that the number of chinese bitcoin miners could be as high as  or moreclose to  of bitcoin mining is being done by countries that the us considers adversaries on balance these countries have been net sellers of bitcoin over the last several years while us and european investors and financial institutions have been net buyersits not entirely clear who all the chinese russian and iranian entities mining bitcoin are or what links if any they have to their government or military they may not have any the iranian revolutionary guard corps however has long been rumored to be involved in bitcoin miningthe current pace of activity represents a transfer of over  billion of wealth each year from the us and its european allies to potential adversaries that transfer represents only new mining activity it does not take into account the appreciation in previously mined bitcoin that those miners may have retained that also applies on a smaller scale to the transfer of wealth to north korean bitcoin miners an activity that is certainly occurring under government control and whose scope is unknownthe third and most serious threat to us national security is the impact of digital currencies on both the status of the dollar as a reserve currency and on american control over the institutionsmechanisms of the international monetary systemthe us government obtains an enormous amount of political leverage from its influence over the institutionsstructures of the international monetary system that influence is the result of a number of factors the role of the dollar as a reserve currency the fact that much of the worlds trade including the trade in commodities is denominated in dollars the size of the us economy still about a quarter of global gross national product the role of us banks in the international system and de facto us control over many of the institutions that enable global capital flowsover the last several decades successive administrations have used economic and financial sanctions as a preferred alternative to armed conflict and as a key instrument of foreign policy any development that erodes the us position astride the international monetary system directly impacts the tools that washington has available to implement its foreign policy and by extension will raise national security issueschina has already announced plans for a digital yuan while at the same time banning the use of cryptocurrencies for commercial transactions beijing has not banned bitcoin mining although it has stated that it might do so in the us the federal reserve has also announced that it is studying the creation of a digital dollarmost currency transactions today are electronic the difference between a digital currency and electronic transactions is that a blockchainbased digital currency would bypass financial intermediaries like swift and the international banking systems digital currencies could be exchanged in a peertopeer network and would be extremely hard if not impossible to monitordigital currencies would make it harder to impose financial sanctions on a country its companies or citizens they could lead to the development of a separate parallel financialmonetary system from the current one in such a system firstmover status is a significant advantagea digital monetary system doesnt have to be based on a cryptocurrency in fact it is more likely to be based on a digitized already existing fiat currency a fiat currency is not backed by a physical commodity but by the government that issued it many of the software features embedded in cryptocurrencies can be embedded into digital fiat currencies also that currency especially if it was backed by a large economy like chinas would be in a strong position to challenge the dollars current primacythe issue grows even more complex if you consider the potential impact of tokenization a blockchainbased digital currency can function just as well on any digitizedtokenized assettokenization refers to the process of converting ownership rights in a particular asset into a digital token on a blockchain these can include unique hash values which represent physical assets financial instruments real estate equity bonds fund unitsfundamentally this activity is nothing new its simply the digital version of the asset securitization activity that financial markets have been doing for yearsproponents of bitcoin for example point out that the total quantity of coins is limited to  million they tout bitcoin as an asset that is not subject to the depreciation inherent in fiat currencies touted as the digital equivalent of gold as a store of value they postulate that if a significant portion of the  trillion invested in gold was converted to bitcoin the price of the digital currency would soarthere are lots of assets however whose supply is limited or fixed if those assets were tokenized they would function in exactly the same way as bitcoin and other digital currenciesfor example there are the vast collections of art that have been amassed in the national museums of the us france italy and the uk there are the enormous land holdings that the us government has including the national park system and the mineral rights to federal lands and the continental shelf under its jurisdictionthe us government also controls the rights to the electromagnetic spectrum portions of which can be used for broadcast cellular telephony or internet access and are quite valuable governments own a lot of stuff their value is in the trillions of dollars historically those assets are part of the government’s “good faith and credit” that back the us dollarthese assets are difficult to monetize however except indirectly via a fiat currency tokenization allows any government asset to be converted into a digital currencylike instrument in some ways this is a throwback to the early days of the us when the federal government often issued bonds that were backed by the proceeds of government land salesif tokenized art becomes just one of several possible bases for digital currencies then the louvre museum in paris or the british museum and the national gallery in london are the financial equivalent of the us gold reserves in fort knox by an exponential factorcrypto currencies are only the first phase of a tokenization and blockchain based transformation of the international monetary system and of the role of money in modern economies indeed tokenization will likely make cryptocurrencies obsolete before they ever get establishedthe changes in the international monetary system that blockchain cryptocurrencies and tokenization will create could have a profound impact on the centrality of the us dollar and the international financial system that has evolved around it in turn those changes will have significant consequences on the tools that future administrations will have with which to implement us foreign policy and ensure us national securityeditors note an earlier version of this article cited the value of the collected art works of monet at  trillion the correct number is  billion while the stated value was incorrect it does not change the conclusion of how cryptocurrencies impact us national security the opinions expressed in this oped are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the
