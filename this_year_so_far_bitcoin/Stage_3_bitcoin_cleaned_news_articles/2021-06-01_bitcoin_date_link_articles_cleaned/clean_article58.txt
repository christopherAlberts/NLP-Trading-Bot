this post originally appeared on the unbounded capital website and we republished with permission from dave mullenmuhrfor years one of the predominant debates in bitcoin has been the block size debate should bitcoin have “small blocks” processing computationally small amounts of data every  mins should bitcoin have “big blocks” processing as much data as possible or should bitcoin find a goldilocks zone somewhere between the two as this block size debate raged on the different viewpoints became irreconcilable and each vision went their own way creating independent “forked” blockchains today we have btc pursuing the small block vision with  megabyte mb blocks bch pursuing the goldilocks vision with  mb of data allowed per block and bsv pursuing the big block vision with an unbounded block size which has yielded blocks containing over  mb of data bsv’s aim is to soon process gigabytes gb and ultimately terabyte tb and petabyte pb sized blocksif you’re still with me i’m honestly somewhat impressed  mb  mb  mb terabyte huh what does any of this even mean for the average person a megabyte is not an intuitive unit maybe you know the market price for a  tb hard drive for the weeks and months after you purchase one on amazon if you work in it maybe you have a more embodied and lasting understanding but in general data is hard to grasp especially when you are trying to think in terms of the price or value of data which are units and values that change rapidly getting bigger and cheaper over timethere is however one major exception cell phone plans the average person has a monthly cell phone bill with a data package this is typically a significant cost especially for heads of households paying for  or more lines each month because of the cost people typically shop around to find the most competitive option thus people have an embodied sense of what data cost and practically speaking what various data sizes will get you is  gb of monthly shared data enough should you upgrade to the  gb option or maybe just go allin on the unlimited plan these are tradeoffs most people understand let’s use this to better understand the data debate regarding block sizes in bitcoinif btc was a family planbtc has pursued their small block vision for bitcoin this means that only  mb of data can be processed every  minutes because this is so small the average iphone photo is about  mb for reference and particularly so for a network with global aspirations there is more demand for reserving a slice of this data than there is supply  mb as a result a fee market has developed so that users can outbid each other to buy their way onto the network ultimately these fees are paying for data much like how you pay for cell phone data let’s take a look at the april  phone bill using the btc carrier million for  gb of data i hope those  gb are not overages this seems a bit higher than verizon in the btc carrier’s defense they are offering qualitatively different data than that offered via a verizon cell phone plan but this framework does provide a sense of the relative cost an apple to apples comparison to bsv which has pursued the big block path will be informativeif bsv was a family planhow does the bsv carrier stack up with an unbounded block size there is no artificial scarcity on the supply of space on the bsv network that can be occupied by user data because of this the fee market is not needed bsv transactions do have fees current median fee is  but these fees are to pay the “bsv carrier” for including their data not to outbid the other guy who also wants to use the network’s artificially scarce space what did the april phone bill look like for the bsv carrier for  gb of data this is still out of market for typical cell phone plans but relative to btc’s  for  times less data it looks pretty goodlong term planningpart of deciding which phone carrier to use is a consideration of what will become of the phone plan maybe they offer free data for the first month after you sign up great but if i’m locked into a multiyear plan i will want to read the fine print what’s going to happen to my bill next year will my carrier’s data plans decrease in price over time as they should given technological innovation will my carrier throttle my data usage in certain circumstances or will i be able to use the data however i see fit these are key questions so what’s in the fine print for the btc and bsv carriersthe btc carrier’s roadmapthe btc carrier is offering one plan  gb of shared data the price of this data will significantly increase over time and you can only use the data as they see fit it will be throttled for all nonapproved use caseshuh yep that’s right btc has more or less committed to their  mb block size for the foreseeable future some influential btc developers think of them collectively as ctos with majority voting rights for the btc carrier have even suggested reducing this down to  if successful with this decrease your  gb of shared monthly data shared with your global “family” will be reduced to  gb even if this doesn’t happen it is likely that you will be stuck with  gb for the foreseeable futurebut if the data allowance is capped how will fees increase despite the constant march forward for computer chip innovation your btc carrier data package will and must increase orders of magnitude over time popular btc thought leaders encourage users to “embrace” the network’s “sustained high fees” which they claim are a feature not a bug “fees are designed to pump forever”okay…well at least this data will be extremely useful right well as a customer of the btc plan you will be able to use the data in the way that the ctos want you to if you are looking to use your plan to play games or apps that are not sanctioned you’ll be out of lucka compelling offerthe bsv carrier’s roadmapmaybe ever increasing costs with limited functionality on a stagnant maybe decreasing data plan isn’t what you want what is the competition offering the bsv carrier is effectively offering an unlimited data package a package likely familiar to actual phone plan shoppers in  today data is cheap and getting cheaper thus consumers rightfully expect this to be reflected in their datadependent utilities the bsv plan is unlimited data with a payasyougo structure with decreasing costs per unit of data over time and total freedom on how that data is used by customers who buy itif you want to use  gb this month go for it the bsv carrier will charge you for your use at market price with razor thin margins if you’re off the grid on a tropical vacation and don’t need much data you’ll be charged very littlethe razor thin margins on your plan will have an impact on the future price of your plan too the margins are so thin because the bsv carrier is serviced by an open market of providers these providers are competing to process your data as innovation continues to decrease the cost of storage and computation this will be reflected in your bill when you use data from the bsv carrier you can be assured that you’re getting a fair price today  for  gb of data is high but next year that ratio of gb should look much better the same cannot be said for btc which wants and needs that ratio to move in the opposite directionthe freedom to use your data as you please is probably a musthave for most actual cell phone shoppers imagine if verizon said that you can only use your data package to watch movies on netflix if you prefer hulu you’re out of luck if you want to look up a recipe too bad the ability to use the data that you purchased however you want is a key component of the bsv carriers’ ethos the btc carrier effectively prohibits customers from using the data for anything other than financial transactions on bsv customers can use data for financial transactions if they want but they can also use it for games or applications how they use their data is up to themconclusionwhile it would be a fair criticism to suggest that the blockchainasphonebill is not a perfect  analogy the framework for understanding what you are buying when you pay a  transaction fee on btc versus what you are buying when you pay a  fee on bsv is useful nonetheless years of conversations about block sizes and transaction throughput have taught me that most people’s eyes glaze over when you start mentioning megabytes and gigabytes next time you encounter this discussion i hope you use this framework to make it more clearthe btc carrier is offering a family of  trillion  gb of shared monthly data in perpetuity which the hope will become exorbitantly more expensive over timethe bsv carrier is offering unlimited data right now with a payasyougo plan that will decrease substantially in price
