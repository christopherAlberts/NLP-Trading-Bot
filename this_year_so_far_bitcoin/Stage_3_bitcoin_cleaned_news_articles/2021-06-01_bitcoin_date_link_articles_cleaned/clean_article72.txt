nik bhatia says asset managers seeking growth on behalf of their clients need to consider bitcoinmaking excuses that its a bubble means they havent done their research he sayshe adds americans may end up late to the game compared to other parts of the worldsee more stories on insiders business pageasset managers who are tasked with growing wealth would be failing to act in their clients best interest or fulfill their fiduciary duties if they do not research and consider bitcoin as an investment thats according to nik bhatia an adjunct professor of finance and business economics at the university of southern california marshall school of businessonce skeptical of cryptocurrencies traditional wall street firms like goldman sachs jpmorgan and blackrock recently started exposing their clients portfolios to bitcoin and its derivatives their interest fueled a rally that lifted bitcoins price more than  to its peak above  in april from a year earlier the volatile cryptocurrency has since crashed by nearly growth managers that are responsible for securing growth returns for their clients that havent done research into bitcoin at this point are bordering on some sort of fiduciary violation said bhatia who authored the book layered money from gold and dollars to bitcoin and central bank digital currenciesasset managers should have at least read the pros and cons and done their own analysis says bhatia then if they decide its not the right move on behalf of their clients thats okay but thats not what hes been seeing instead its just old narratives being recycled based on headlines he saidbhatia says bitcoin has arrived and its here to stay the cryptocurrencys purpose isnt only as a store of value the assets decentralized neutrality and its ability to be openly verified will likely make it the anchor for the global monetary system in the future replacing the us dollar he sayswhile this view is commonly held among bitcoin bulls other experts including fed officials believe the dollar will maintain its preeminencestill bhatia believes bitcoins protocol for monetary settlement will become the system on which other systems are builti worked in the bond industry for several years and i worked in both operations and trading capacities i was involved in emailing and faxing dollars through the wire process and fed wire and repo settlement and us treasury securities settlements through dtc bhatia told insiderhe continued i saw it every day of my life for several years up close and personal i know the archaic nature of final settlement and the dollar world its just old technology and bitcoin is the technology that will underpin what we think of as final settlement in the future and there will be layers on top of bitcoin just like lightning networkright now the us dollar is the center of international finance and trade its also the global reserve currency and the one several foreign corporations and countries denominate their debt in but its losing its status bhatia says with inflation kicking in assets like land become considered almost superior reserve assets to the dollarbhatia believes bitcoin will be the unit that everybody including global governments and their currencies will strike their balance sheets against knowing all of this means theres no longer an excuse to ignore the assetcan you imagine being a growth manager  years ago with no exposure to the internet and you called it a bubble and then you didnt own amazon as it  over the next several years bhatia said on a podcast episode of what bitcoin didprice volatility is the only investor concern about bitcoin that he acknowledges and only if theres a mandate to have a standard deviation of returns within a certain rangefor bhatia calling bitcoin a bubble only suggests that the firm in question hasnt done its research however he makes it clear that he is not referring to fixedincome managers whose mandates or responsibilities to their investors are to make sure that capital is returned and income is sought the group he is referring to are investment managers who have promised their clients growth in industries that have large opportunities including venture capitalistsif youre ignoring bitcoin now as a growth manager you are ignoring that an alternative monetary reality has come into existence on this planet bhatia said on the podcasthow bitcoin is seen on a global scalebhatia also believes americans may be some of the last people who will get their hands on bitcoin relative to other places in the world his reasoning is that they have not faced as much adversity and insecurity around their dollar as other countries have and to him inflationary concerns arent enough of a motivatorhe says whats driving people in the west to bitcoin is the fear of missing out and the chance of getting greater returns which is not as strong a motivator as other parts of the worldcountries more familiar with economic turmoil or currency debasement are going to be quicker to invest in bitcoin and even convert their savings to it in places like latin america and africa people are already realizing that prices are rising relative to their currencies and they are looking for something more real that they can get their hands on monetarily bhatia said on the podcast
