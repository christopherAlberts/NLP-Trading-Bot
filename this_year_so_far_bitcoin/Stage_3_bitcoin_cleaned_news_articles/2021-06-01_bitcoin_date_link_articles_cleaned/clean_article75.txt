a reflection on the first large correction of and outlook for the remainder of dilutionproof june  cycling onchain is a monthly series that uses onchain and pricerelated data to estimate where we are in bitcoin’s market cycle it originally started as a monthly twitter thread that was later adopted by bitcoin magazine in this first edition of cycling onchain we’ll look back at the first leg up in the – bull run and the circumstances that turned out to be fertile soil for a firm downward correction that brought fear into the market the second part will attempt to look forward by building a case for why we may not have seen the top of this market cycle as well as some of its vulnerabilitiesthe january turnaroundjust like the previous two versions ’s halving created a supply shock that triggered an exponential price increase however in comparison to the previous  halving cycle this cycle heated up much faster figure figure  the bitcoin price temperature bands per halving cycleas you would expect during such a rapid price increase market participants started taking profits when the bitcoin price broke its alltime high in december  and the period after figure  since forming a local market top in january  profit taking decreased — despite the price still grinding up further during that periodfigure  a sevenday moving average of the entityadjusted spent output profit ratio soprimage sourcewhat usually happens during these exponential price increases figure  is that longterm bitcoin holders green start to gradually sell while new market participants purple start building their positions — until the market cycle reaches a top and both parties switch rolesfigure  the bitcoin price black and the total blue longterm holder green and shortterm holder supply pinkimage sourceif we zoom in on the net position change of the longterm bitcoin holders figure  we see that longterm holders were mostly selling up to the january  local top slowed down their spending afterward and have turned into net accumulators during this price dipfigure  bitcoin price black and longterm holder supply change green and redimage sourcea similar trend can be witnessed in the net position change of miners figure  another class of market participants with clear longterm market experience and exposurefigure  bitcoin price black and miner net position change green and redimage sourcelevering it upin march  a large macrodriven price crash cleared the bitcoin market from all leverage and created more organic market conditions that turned out to lay the groundwork for this – bull run since then a clear trend of decreasing bitcoin reserves on exchanges was witnessed suggesting that a large supply shock was forming after the bitcoin price broke its  alltime high this trend has accelerated on pure spot exchanges that don’t offer derivatives trading figure figure  bitcoin reserves on spot exchangesimage sourcehowever the opposite is true when looking at exchanges that do offer derivatives products figure  these derivatives exchanges have seen their bitcoin reserves increase especially after the price started consolidating and correctingfigure  bitcoin balances on derivative exchangesimage sourcethe bitcoin reserves on derivatives exchanges are at least partially held as collateral for high leveraged trading in the months following the january  local top the amount of open interest on bitcoin futures more than doubled figure  suggesting that market participants were increasingly comfortable taking risks — a possible sign of market euphoriafigure  open interest in bitcoin futures on all exchanges sourceimage sourceas can be seen in figure  most of this open interest was representing long positions when the market is massively overleveraged into one direction there is a clear incentive for large market participants to push the price the other way when the bitcoin price drops below a long position’s liquidation price exchanges can forcesell the position creating even more downward price pressure potentially forming a cascading effect of long liquidations that is combined with a steep price decline which is exactly what we saw on may  figure  funding rate of perpetual bitcoin futures on all exchangesimage sourcea change of scenerya change of scenery could be witnessed in several other metrics during the first quarter of  for instance the bitcoin holdings of the grayscale bitcoin trust that had seen steep increases based on institutional demand stopped rising in february  figure  while the premium on its gbtc shares actually turned deeply negativefigure  the bitcoin price black and grayscales holdings green and premium over spotmarket price purpleimage sourceduring the first quarter of  the anticipation of coinbase’s direct listing sometimes referred to as their initial public offering or ipo was another narrative that a lot of market participants were following both the bitcoin price orange and coin price black and white were creeping up during the months up to this event and found their alltime highs around their direct listing date on april   figure  the direct listing was accompanied with large sell pressure from coinbase executives that were selling part of their positions creating a steep downward price movement in the price of their sharesfigure  usd price charts for coinbase coin black and white and bitcoin btc orangeimage sourceanother clear trend change that occurred after the january  local top was the fast decline in bitcoin dominance that we have seen since then figure  this declining bitcoin dominance means that altcoin price appreciation was outperforming that of bitcoin which can likely be attributed to retail market participants entering the scene en massefigure  bitcoin dominance black and white and price orangeimage sourceyoung whales crashing the partysince the january  local top a clear downward trend can be witnessed in the degree in which older coins are responsible for the onchain volume figure  this means that recent price movements can increasingly be attributed to relatively young market participantsfigure  a sevenday moving average of the entityadjusted bitcoin dormancyimage sourcewhen zooming in on the onchain movements of the largest players in the bitcoin market “whales” it is also clear that most of the onchain movements were made by young whales an example of this is visualized in figure  where the green circles highlight the magnitude of whale addresses that transacted onchain during the may   capitulation event these onchain movements are likely a combination of these young whales  triggering the price crash itself  selling out of anxiety  getting liquidated from their long positions and  buying back at a lower price for tax benefits “tax harvesting”figure  outflows from whale wallets on may  image sourcea mountain without a peakthe big question that remains — is this party over nowit is impossible to predict the future based on historical data since the context of that data continuously changes and future events can simply take a different course nonetheless comparing current and historical onchain data structures can be helpful to gauge to what extent cyclical investor behavior rhymes in terms of market psychologyone example of this is illustrated in figure  unlike the previous market cycles whose tops were all marked by an exponential blowoff top that was combined with longterm holders massively selling into market strength this cycle so far has had neither of course this cycle does not have to be similar to the previous ones but this does illustrate that it would be quite atypical if the current cycle indeed ends with a dudfigure  the reserve risk indicatorimage sourcea new hopeas just pointed out we cannot predict the future based on onchain data but we can monitor trends in its flows to help us understand recent market movements and more substantially speculate where the market might move next despite the steep price drop some positive onchain signals could be witnessedduring the recent market correction exchanges saw large net inflows of the shortterm holders that were getting out of their positions figure  as price declined so did the net transfer volume fromto exchanges even turning net negative again near the end of the price dip this suggests that the lower prices triggered new demand increasing confidence that buyers will continue to step in during dipsfigure  a sevenday moving average of the net transfer volume of bitcoin fromto exchangesimage sourceduring this dip there also were large outflows in overthecounter otc trade desks figure  these otc desks facilitate trading between larger entities that want to buy or sell bitcoin without moving marketsfigure  a sevenday moving average of bitcoin outflows of otc trade desksimage sourceanother possible sign of continued demand for spot exposure to bitcoin is the stablecoin reserves on spot exchanges that have continued to go up figure figure  stablecoin reserves on spot exchangesimage sourcebased on the number of accumulation addresses recently peaking to new alltime highs the price dip also appears to have triggered market participants to dollarcost average dca into a bitcoin position figure figure  number of bitcoin accumulation addressesimage sourcefinally the recent spike in the net growth of entities on the bitcoin network suggests that during the price crash more entities joined than left also suggesting that the lower prices enticed some people to buy into a position figure figure  a sevenday moving average of the net growth of entities on the bitcoin networkimage sourcealthough twitter polls always need to be taken with a grain of salt the results of the poll displayed in figure  provide another signal that market participants still have a positive mid to longterm expectation for the bitcoin price respondents are neutral to mildly bullish on a weekly to monthly time frame but clearly still very bullish on a yearly time framefigure  bitcoin market sentiment based on a may   twitter pollimage sourcetaprootbesides pricerelated interest in bitcoin’s prospects prospects about bitcoin’s taproot protocol upgrade may provide a more fundamental driver for enthusiasm throughout the remainder of  taproot improves some of bitcoin’s onchain privacy characteristics and unlocks new possibilities for scaling smart contracts and lightning the protocol upgrade is expected to be locked into activation within the next two weeks and will be activated in november  if successfulfigure  the status of the miner signaling process for the taproot bitcoin protocol update on june  image sourcea note of cautionthe recent unwinding of leverage and change of scenery provided a call for caution as well as a warning that the bitcoin market has reached a very volatile and vulnerable phase regardless of the direction in which it moves nextduring the past year bitcoin has matured into a macroasset that is increasingly adopted by institutional investors moving the asset into a whole new playing field it may therefore see regulatory headwinds that can spur anxiety into markets even if those narratives are based on flawed informationanother possible result of the increased institutional adoption is that its price developments may increasingly start following those of the larger overall macro cycle like we saw in march  its price course may be impacted if a macroeconomic breakdown were to happena possible outlook for there are no guarantees that the bitcoin price will necessarily mimic the trajectories of its previous halving cycles nonetheless models like the  and  timebased models or more simple previous cycle indexes that are displayed in figure  may be useful for getting a rough idea of what may be ahead if bitcoin’s fouryear cycle indeed rhymes at least one more timefigure  bitcoin halving cycle roadmap –disclaimer this article was
