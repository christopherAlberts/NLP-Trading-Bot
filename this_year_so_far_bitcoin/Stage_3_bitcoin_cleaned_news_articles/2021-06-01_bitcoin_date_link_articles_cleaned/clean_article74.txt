bitcoin’s proposed taproot upgrade has been highly anticipated and is now increasingly supported by the communitythe update would enable improvements on the blockchain in areas including privacy scalability and securityover  of blocks have signaled support and just  additional signaling blocks are needed for the upgrade to lock in during the current difficulty periodfollowing the segwit softfork in  which increased the block size limit on the bitcoin blockchain the most anticipated change to the network – taproot – is likely to see a successful processover  of bitcoin hashrate signaling supporttaproot currently has more than the required minimum of miners signaling support to lock in the upgrade according to the rules  of blocks mined within one of bitcoin’s difficulty periods must signal support for the activation in novemberthe upgrade was first proposed in  by bitcoin core contributor gregory maxwell as of october  taproot has been merged to the bitcoin core library after a request created by pieter wuille the soft fork is the latest step that would enhance the network’s usability and securityamendments to the leading cryptocurrency network have been infrequent as the process is difficult given the consensus that must be achieved among a diverse and dispersed community as seen in the case of segwit there was a lack of consensus and a group of users decided to hard fork which created bitcoin cash while another cohort generated bitcoin goldif  of miners signal support before august  the network will see enhanced smart contract capabilities and increased privacy the threshold must be reached within  blocks roughly around two weeks before the activation window endstaproot’s speedy trial activation process which began on may  is in the third signaling periodthe data size of the smart contracts would be lowered through the soft fork decreasing transaction costs on the network this is done by altering two lines of code that would see bitcoin with a new signature scheme known as schnorr signatureswith the emergence of the new code multisignature transactions would be cheaper and more dataefficient these upgrades would also highlight interest in the lightning network and other bitcoin technologies including discreet log contractsalthough the signaling process could last until august over  of blocks have been signaling for taproot data on the blockchain shows that we will most likely see a successful process in around ten days when the current difficulty period is overaccording to taproot watch  additional signaling blocks are needed for the softfork to lock in with the current signaling ratio of taproot watchcompared to early may the bitcoin community has made significant progress on this policy stance at the time only around  of blocks signaled support for taprootalthough unlikely if the  threshold is not reached before midaugust taproot will be up for discussion again
