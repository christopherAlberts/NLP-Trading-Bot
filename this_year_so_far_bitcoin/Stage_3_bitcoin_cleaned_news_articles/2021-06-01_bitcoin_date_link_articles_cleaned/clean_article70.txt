risks make sure investing in cryptocurrency doesn’t hold you back from saving and maintaining an emergency fund paying off credit card and other highinterest debt and saving for retirement with a more conventional investment strategyfor more good perspective here’s what some of our favorite personal finance influencers are saying about crypto jeremy schneider personal finance clubjeremy schneiderschneider has been familiar with bitcoin since its inception“i remember the day in  when i learned about bitcoin for about  minutes i pondered buying some bitcoin and decided there was no way it could ever reach ” says schneider bitcoin of course blew past  on its way to a high of more than  in april  it currently sits just under  after a tumultuous maystill schneider warns against letting investing fomo pressure you into making your decisions instead schneider constantly reminds his followers of two simple rules for building wealth live below your means and invest early and often preferably in index fundsschneider says his net worth is about  million of that he has about  in cryptocurrencies — far less than even  for those interested in playing around in the space schneider recommends making a similarly small investment compared to your net worth“at its core i don’t see it as a productive asset if you buy an index fund or real estate you get dividends or rental income whereas if you get crypto you’re basically just hoping someone pays you more money for it in the future” says schneider “i can imagine a world  years from now where crypto could go to zero or a different coin emerges whatever but i can’t imagine a world in  years where index funds and real estate don’t make you very wealthy” jullyalma taveras investing latinajullyalma taverasjullyalma taveras who goes by “investing latina” online thinks there’s a great opportunity to diversify your holdings with a cryptocurrency asset“it’s something people should start learning more about at the very least” says taveras “it’s not something anyone should be putting all of their money or fortunes into but i think it’s something that we should include in a diversified portfolio”as a new and uncertain new investment asset taveras recommends keeping your allocation to  of your total assets she’s also sticking to the two largest cryptos for now“i have bitcoin and ethereum and that’s as far as i’ve gone in my personal portfolio” says taverascomparing crypto to the conventional stock market misses the mark taveras says “it’s not the stock market it’s a completely different world” says taveras and the new world definitely comes with uncertainties “the stock market has been around for over  years and blockchain technology has only been around for a little over a decade” kiana danial invest divakiana danialkiana danial started tracking crypto markets in  but didn’t actually start investing until the end of  danial who runs an account called investdiva on instagram recommends giving plenty of thought to your investing goals before buying cryptocurrency“are you buying it because you want a lottery ticket to make a million dollars in a year” danial asks if that’s the case “then you might want to reconsider your investment strategy because some people have got lucky but a majority of people have got burned” danial told us recentlybut if you’ve done your research and are ok with the risk danial says it might make sense for investors who still have a lot of time before retirement to allocate as much as  of their portfolio to crypto but “please don’t invest in cryptocurrencies based on trends on twitter” marc russell betterwalletmarc russell who uses a virtual avatar on his social accountsas the creator of betterwallet on instagram marc russell’s investing philosophy is to “stick to the basics” he says “longterm boring strategies that work every single time is really where i focus my attention”however russell acknowledges crypto may have a place in your longerterm strategy“i think a lot about asset allocation and just making sure that you have the appropriate mix of stocks bonds and alternatives which is where cryptocurrencies kind of fall under for the simple longterm investor” says russell for educated investors russell recommends allocating about  to cryptocurrency but would caution going beyond like others russell warns of getting swept up in the headlines and emotional rush of getting in on crypto without doing proper diligence “people don’t understand the other side of the spectrum where you can make  on your investment but you can also lose  they think you’re either making  or you’re making  and it doesn’t work that way” says russellbut for those who are educated on the market and know what’s at risk “it’s an excellent diversifier because it’s not correlated to the  market for the most part and when you’re looking for something to diversify you that’s essentially what you’re looking for” says russel humphrey yang humphrey talkshumphrey yanghumphrey yang’s personal finance advice has gone viral on tiktok and youtube he’s a strong believer in index funds “but most people don’t want to do that because it’s too passive and not fun it’s a little bit boring” says yang “but that is honestly the best advice i can give any average investor is just put your money in an index fund and check it once per year”as an experienced investor yang considers cryptocurrency a speculative investment he likes to put between  and  of his total portfolio there an amount he says limits his exposure on days when it’s fallinghe also sticks with two of the betterknown cryptocurrencies out there“i don’t really believe in too many altcoins” says yang “i do bitcoin and ethereum because they’re the two most stable ones and have the most history” tori dunlap her first tori dunlaptori dunlap has had her doubts about crypto“it still feels very speculative” says her first  creator dunlap who saved her first  by age  and shares personal finance advice on tiktok and instagram but she also recognizes the big interest in crypto investing “even if it’s just a small amount of money”but when people ask her about it she recommends following the  rule “you don’t want to contribute more than  of your portfolio toward these things that haven’t been proven over time” says dunlap “if you are investing a certain amount of money you should maybe be ok losing that amount of money” a’shira nelson savvy girl moneya’shira nelsona’shira nelson of savvy girl money on instagram is the ultimate retirementminded investor“my strategy is to max out my retirement accounts for the most part i only invest in lowcost index funds” says nelson “i know that i can see history on that i can read books on that”that’s one of the biggest deterrents for her from investing in cryptocurrency — a lack of history and study on the space but she’s quick to remind her followers that there are many other types of investments you can make outside of the stock market and cryptocurrency if you want diversification“i do a lot of real estate investing” says nelson “my husband helped me spice up my portfolio with real estate and it’s an easy way to have fun with it too”
