yahoo financeâ€™s myles udland brian sozzi and julie hyman discuss the latest cryptocurrency action with jeffrey wang the amber group head of americasvideo transcriptmyles udland all right welcome back to yahoo finance live on this tuesday morning us stocks a mixed picture here we see bitcoin still trading right around  as the market continues to digest that rough weekend that we saw a couple weeks back so where do things stand in the crypto space as we head towards the second half of  joining us now for that conversation is jeffrey wang hes the head of americas at the amber group a crypto finance firmso jeff i would just start with how you guys are talking about this market with your clients who maybe theyve gotten into the space in a big way for the first time in the last  months hadnt seen the kind of up and down cycle that you certainly know is a feature of the crypto markets and and how you guys have again talked through the last quarter which you know all in all has been a little flattish for bitcoinjeffrey wang yeah i mean i think i think a lot of the new entrants weve seen in the past six months have been kind of on the institutional side very experienced investors you know existing macro funds setting up digital arms so a lot of these investors are you know very familiar with big big volatility assets but for the most part people who have recently entered are you know looking at this with a medium to longterm view are not really shaken up by it and in general actually theyve had more kind of powder to use and theyve been actually buying on dipsso you know that was kind of the the large motto weve seen from a lot of investors over the past six months saying you know i wish i could buy bitcoin on a dip when we had that rally up to  and here we have that dip and actually we are seeing some of the largest investors you know not fazed by it still buying kind of averaging in and generally not not not that bothered i think they do have the medium to longerterm viewstory continuesso at this point you know i think most investors are either have experiences before from the retail side or are looking at it from a longterm view from the institutional side so not not too much not too many people in in that much painjulie hyman jeffrey its julie here you are a veteran currency regular currency plain old vanilla currency traderjeffrey wang yeahjulie hyman and you traded other exotics as well but im really curious how this compares to that you know are are there analytics from fx that you can even apply to to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies how do you sort of think about this versus what you did before or is it really quite differentjeffrey wang yeah thats a really a really good question i think in general the bitcoin and crypto market in its in a whole is quite similar to traditional assets in the sense that theres a road map its going to follow so obviously bitcoin and crypto in general is much more volatile than than foreign exchange equities but you know were were seeing this kind of whole industry develop around itand and the good thing is crypto can essentially follow the path thats been laid before it in that sense what i mean is in we know which products have sold well in foreign exchange in equities in terms of what retail likes to buy what businesses are needed to support the the trading environment and essentially you know crypto can grow much faster because it can really just follow the footsteps of fx and equities which you know took decades to kind of develop and and for the market to figure out products supporting services and and and bitcoin is kind of just following itof course you know the volatility is much higher so you have to get used to that but in general yeah the markets kind of function as as as other kind of financial markets are and i think crypto as an asset class is kind of has established itself as you know viable so yeah i think i think the future is still pretty pretty strong for the industry as a wholebrian sozzi jeffrey whats the next buying signal youre looking at for bitcoinjeffrey wang yeah thats a tough one i think hopefully the the time of those violent moves that we saw two weeks ago you know are subdued for now so you know things have bottomed out things are relatively calm and going forward the markets going to be need to be a bit more discerning kind of across the board meaning you know a few months ago you could have bought any kind of coin across you know maybe the top hundred coins and pretty much theyd all go up and you know you wouldnt even have to worryfrom here on out youre going to be a bit more discerning kind of find projects that are adding value where the tokenomics makes sense but in general on bitcoin i think i think if youre a believer for the medium term you kind of just have to average in because it is really hard to time i mean i bought some lower i bought some much higher than here so i think you kind of just need to average in and and hold for the for the medium termmyles udland and you know jeffrey just thinking about what your clients are trying to accomplish with their crypto allocation is it a source of alpha is it a source of diversification is it because something their investors have demanded be part of a portfolio how are those clients or how are your clients i guess responding to to their interest or the way that theyre being guided by their own clients into this spacejeffrey wang yeah i think its a bit of both so for one lets say youre an institution that has been traditionally in you know the macro space youve kind of seen very low volatility in a lot of your underlyings and then you look on the digital asset side and youre seeing you know potentially huge gains that youre missing out onand then on on the flip side of that sorry is also that youre seeing your competitors also set up digital arms so youre kind of missing out on that as well so theres a bit of peer pressure involved but i think crypto has kind of backed itself up and it is a kind of viable asset classand there are you know real opportunities there is real money to be made so i guess when a traditional firm that is really just trying to provide performance for for their investors and you see an asset that can you know have  moves you know it is volatile and you can have down days obviously but you know if for these kind of traders and professional investors you know theyre looking at the upsidemyles udland yeah easier to explain why its down  than why you missed the  move on the upside when people come calling that one all right jeffrey wang is the head of americas at the amber group jeffrey thanks so much for jumping on this morning
