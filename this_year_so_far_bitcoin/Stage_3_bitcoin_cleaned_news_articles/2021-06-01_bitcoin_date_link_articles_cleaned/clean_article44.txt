may was a pretty eventful month on the us regulatory front and on the crypto front generally the biden administration is finally moving beyond broad statements and beginning to hint at what the industry can actually expect from new crypto regulationsyou’re reading state of crypto a coindesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government click here to sign up for future editionsthe biden administration gets busythe narrativebitcoin’s price dropped  then recovered a bit then dropped a bit more and elon musk was only partly responsible various us government officials at different agencies described how they’re looking at crypto and crypto regulations a congressional caucus focused on fintech and crypto has launchedwhy it matterswe’re finally getting a glimpse into how exactly president joe biden’s administration sees crypto there’ve been more warnings against bad actors and toofast efforts than there are concrete regulatory proposals but the general trendline seems to be a growing acceptance that crypto is here to staybreaking it downa lot happened in the last two weeksthe federal deposit insurance corporation officially published its request for information about how banks are using digital assets and what the federal regulator could do to assist entitiesnew acting comptroller of the currency michael hsu announced he had ordered his staff to review all pending matters and interpretive guidance issued under the trump administration read former acting comptroller brian brooks before revealing in a congressional hearing the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corporation were discussing a potential interagency group to examine crypto policy fed vice chair randal quarles confirmed this in another hearing last weeka day later federal reserve chairman jerome powell reiterated the fed’s first research paper about a digital dollar would be published this summer and he believes a us central bank digital currency should prioritize consumer privacy and protectiona few hours after that securities and exchange commission chairman gary gensler warned that bad actors in crypto should prepare for enforcement actions he spoke during an address to  members of the financial industry regulatory authorityalso on thursday the treasury department published a tax plan that included an entire section on crypto warning there was a “significant detection problem” with crypto use for illicit activities it suggested that exchanges receiving over  in crypto in a single transaction should report itso yeah a lot happenedmy personal opinion overall the week was a good sign for the industry mainstream adoption will depend in some part on crypto being seen as “normal” like cash or more traditional assets as caitlin long of wyoming and avanti fame put it in this excellent thread the us’ policy approach under the biden administration so far seems to be “if you comply with applicable laws and regulations we’re cool with whatever”through that lens the internal revenue service cracking down on those trying to hide their crypto gains or gensler’s sec going after scammers or other lawbreakers is goodthis is of course dependent at least a little on gensler providing some of the regulatory clarity everyone hopes for so crypto companies don’t have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal counsel to try and conduct a small legally compliant token salethe fed’s paper i think will be informative but i’ve still seen nothing to suggest the central bank is actually going to issue a digital dollar or any other form of central bank digital currency the fact it’s having these discussions publicly is a good sign though it normalizes how other institutions are going to be talking about this subject – such as for example those banks that may be hesitant to offer crypto companies services or to dabble in stablecoinsthe fdic’s involvement is another positive sign for banks if and this is a pretty big if banks can secure deposit insurance for cryptorelated activities financial institutions can be even more confident that any money they store in crypto is safethe main issues that should concern the industry stem from the occ i don’t think hsu’s review of brooks’ actions are a surprise he’s a new agency head who was about to testify in front of a committee whose chair has already asked president joe biden to overturn brooks’ actions i’d have been surprised if hsu said anything other than “we’re taking a look we’ll get back to you later”that being said the same day as the congressional hearing sen sherrod brown dohio who runs the senate banking committee asked hsu to “reassess” the occ trust charters issued to anchorage paxos and protego these companies currently have conditional trust charters so hsu’s response will be key here recall that rep maxine waters dcalif who chairs the house financial services committee has already asked that brooks’ occ regulations be overturned with that sort of pressure we might not see much in the way of further cryptofriendly regulations from the agencyon the flip side bitcoin’s recent market movements are probably not great for getting a bitcoin exchangetraded fund etf approvedbaby banksnathan dicamillo contributed reportingnebraska and illinois are getting their own special purpose depository institutioncrypto banking laws following in wyoming’s footsteps and taking the industry closer to having banking institutions stemming directly from the industryillinois’ trust charter bill would create a special purpose trust charter for digital assets which both new businesses and existing financial institutions – such as banks – could take advantage of said rep margaret croke d the bill’s sponsorthe bill would offer stability to businesses that wonder how they could legally provide crypto companies with services croke saidillinois is starting with a focus on custody but chasse rehwinkel the acting state banking director didn’t rule out expanding regulations to cover lending or other activities in the futurecroke noted that federal deposit insurance corporationinsured entities can offer crypto custody services under the illinois billsimilarly nebraska’s new law would create newly chartered digital asset banks or new digital asset divisions within already established banks“i think we’re going to see the true value of crypto over the next few years but i do think it’s definitely going to have a place in our financial institutions i think the international impact of crypto and blockchain is a whole ‘nother conversation but the international aspect i find very very compelling” croke told mecroke said the regulations has support from various business types though she said she couldn’t name any of these businesses at this timeimportantly illinois’ bill appears to have support directly from the state’s banks according to rehwinkel“more than a year ago we were talking with our existing banks that were trying to be in the crypto space and also the general industry that was looking for custodial services in an illinoisbased company that dealt with crypto so that spurred us to look around at what other states have done” rehwinkel saidillinois’ trust charter is designed to fold new crypto rules into the state’s existing bank regulations rehwinkel said“as we develop new charters there’s probably things we can pick up and drop off we always appreciate wyoming going first with what made sense to them and then looking at the pieces and seeing what makes sense for us” rehwinkel saidthe illinois bill would let de novo or new institutions to begin operating he saidnebraska’s legislative bill  requires that institutions under the new charter call themselves “digital asset banks” and not refer to themselves just as “banks”unlike wyoming’s special purpose depository institutions digital asset banks under the nebraska legislation cannot take fiat deposits like spdis they can custody crypto and stake digital assetsthe measure allows state and national banks to work side by side on digital asset initiatives as letters from the us office of the comptroller of the currency make national banks more comfortable with digital assets said mark quandahl an omaha attorney involved in the nebraska legislation“i think this is kind of a good step to help spur more innovation and further items and policy items that the legislature might need to discuss to make sure this is an industry that is both safely overseen and has a strong regulatory structure but is able to grow and be all that it intends to do” rehwinkel saidbiden’s rulechanging of the guardkey nom  nominee rum  rumored act  acting inc  incumbent no
