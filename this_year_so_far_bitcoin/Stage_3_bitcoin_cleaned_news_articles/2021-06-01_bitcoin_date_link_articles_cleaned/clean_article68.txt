china recently announced a major crackdown on cryptocurrency the relative ease of use of existing currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum and their transparent operating code is apparently too much for the people’s republic to allow its citizens to use the development mirrors an apparent but not as welldefined push by biden administration officials and members of the media to sink or at least control the crypto market with recent public attention on the role of cryptocurrencies there is a unique window for washington to shape or strangle the rise of what it increasingly sees as a competitor and threat to its system of fiat currencythe federal response shows a veneer of ostensible reasons for the government crackdown at the start of the most recent crypto boom treasury secretary janet yellen janet louise yellentreasury irs announce tool to help nonfilers register for child tax credit republicans open new line of attack on irs why the democrats need joe manchin more sounded the alarm about bitcoin being “inefficient” rumors about the securities and exchange commission investigating tesla magnate elon musk elon reeve muskon the money house democrats line up  in

more’s dogecoin tweets were so persistent that musk himself commented saying such an investigation would be “awesome” after all as the washington post put it crypto has an “elon musk problem” the ability for investors or tech giants to utilize cryptocurrencies will be a lucrative opening for the government either to coerce their cooperation or to simply seize control and if it cannot be controlled it can be taxedparalleling ronald reagan’s old quip — “if it moves tax it” — lawmakers may have steep new crypto taxes in mind one of the most persistent predictions of the past month is a potentially massive surcharge on any alternative currency gains one rumor is that yellen wants an  percent crypto tax even without such a new burden president biden joe bidenformer rep rohrabacher says he took part in jan  march to capitol but did not storm building saudis picked up drugs in cairo used to kill khashoggi report biden looking to build momentum for putin meeting more’s proposed tax changes will heavily impact online traders shortterm holders of currencies such as bitcoin may see their effective tax rate surge from  percent to  percent just this week the biden administration announced new regulations forcing taxpayers to report major crypto gains as the white house put it cryptocurrency “poses a significant detection problem by facilitating illegal activity broadly including tax evasion”advertisementmeanwhile the media are pushing a fullcourt press against the rise of crypto any number of recent news pieces shape a narrative that mining the coins is bad for the environment however in many ways crypto mining and distribution is far more efficient proportional to traditional finance the recent increase in interest also sparked a widescale microchip shortage beyond the environmental and market constraints media hype paints crypto as a tech gateway to several societal problems heck one trope is that the free nature of crypto may not liberalize markets at all — but instead may be a trojan horse for authoritarianismthe new york times pushed the idea that crypto is ultimately a safe haven for criminals at least  percent of all crypto transactions happen in privacy wallets nothing would make regulators frustrated like currency transfers outside of the view and control of the federal government it certainly doesn’t help that the proprietors of the colonial pipeline allegedly paid a  million ransom to hackers using bitcoin how long will it be until greta thunberg graces stalinesque billboards frowning and lecturing motorists that mining or holding crypto is killing the planetall of these moves are happening during a steep decline in crypto prices across the board if there were ever an opening for government overreach it would be now before crypto could pose an existential threat to fiat money regulators could argue that the massive price swings and use in criminal enterprises overshadow the leveling effect that cryptocurrencies have on the wider market i have written about how washington or the federal reserve may push its own superseding “fedcoin” concept and use it to effectively gut the existing crypto wild west all of these potentials tap into the worst impulses of dc and the fed they enact policies that weaken the us dollar and restrict the ability for citizens to preserve wealth during inflationary periods ultimately any set of laws or regulations would effectuate government control of global transactionswhat does this mean for the average crypto investor or dabbler perhaps not much in the short term you might check your robinhood account to see the daily price changes and not think much of the overall picture however the overarching effect is like a ratchet — government only takes more control and never moves in the other direction a unique mixture of regulation media frenzy and taxation could neuter the entire concept of a decentralized free market system that bitcoin ethereum dogecoin et al represent when that day occurs the ability for free citizens to hold value outside of a rapidlyinflating us dollar disintegrates just as china fears the possibility that its citizens are able to
