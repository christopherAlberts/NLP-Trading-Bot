bitcoin’s taproot update — the biggest anticipated change to the bitcoin blockchain since  — is up for another vote will it pass this timetaproot was first proposed in  by gregory maxwell a bitcoin core btc contributor and former chief technology officer at blockstream a bitcoin and blockchain technology company the taproot update — slated to be deployed in november if at least  of miners signal support before august  — is expected to enhance bitcoin’s smart contract capabilities and boost privacy the proposed soft fork will also require that enough miners “signal” support via the block creation process — a requirement for activation that has yet to be metthe proposed update would combine the schnorr signature scheme with mast merklized alternative script tree and leverage a new scripting language called tapscript it would make complex smart contracts like the ones requiring multiple signatures indistinguishable from regular bitcoin transactions enabling greater privacymoreover the update would lower the data size of smart contracts in turn lowering transaction costs taproot is also expected to enhance smart contract functionality and efficiency“together the improvements lay the groundwork for future potential upgrades that may improve efficiency privacy and fungibility further” the official release note for the update saysminers voice support for taproot“taproot is an upgrade that we see not only benefiting bitcoin when an upgrade benefits bitcoin it benefits everyone using it” said alejandro de la torre vice president of the crypto mining pool poolin in an interview with forkastnews “it is a longterm stance from us at poolin  we foresee the benefits slowly building throughout the next couple of years”taproot is bitcoin’s biggest upgrade since the segwit soft fork that was implemented in  which increased the block size limit on the bitcoin blockchain by removing signature data from transactionssegwit which was introduced to increase the blockchain’s capability of processing more transactions per second was surrounded by controversy there was a lack of consensus and a group of users hard forked to create bitcoin cash while another group created bitcoin gold“most in the bitcoin community have ptsd from the last soft fork upgrade” de la torre said “i believe a mast would help heal some wounds from prior upgrades and hopefully garner a feeling of goodwill amongst all participants in bitcoin”the creator of bitcoin satoshi nakamoto built the protocol to be a decentralized digital currency this means there is no controlling group or central body to decide which bitcoin upgrades get implemented instead all key stakeholders must reach a consensus about which upgrades get pushed throughreaching consensus among such a large diverse and dispersed group of participants is always extremely difficult as seen in the case of segwit“taproot is a reminder of the challenges of reaching consensus in a decentralized ecosystem” henri arslanian pwc’s global crypto leader told forkastnews “the challenges around taproot are a reminder of why the last major update was in ”to make the process easier this time last year de la torre headed taproot activation an initiative to gauge mining pools’ willingness to implement taproot about  of the mining pools addressed including the biggest ones were happy to upgrade de la torre saidwithin poolin as well miners unanimously agreed to the taproot upgrade “we had zero complaints from our miners about our taproot efforts” de la torre saidno resolution on taproot just yetdespite the unanimity among the biggest mining pools the method of implementation was up for debate developers deliberated for months on the method of deployment even as the codebase for the update was merged into the bitcoin core library in october after the activation discussions led to a stalemate bitcoin core developers david harding and russell o’connor finally decided on “speedy trial” as the deployment method it was only in april  that the code for speedy trial was merged into bitcoin corespeedy trial which began this month requires that  of miners signal their support for the upgrade by including a “signal bit” in the blocks they mine the  threshold has to be reached within one of the roughly twoweeklong or  blocks difficulty periods before the threemonth activation window ends on august  this yearif the required threshold is reached before august  taproot will be “locked in” for activation in november if the threshold is not reached taproot will be up for discussion again this is unlikely however since most miners have already indicated support for the updateminers are currently in their third signaling period which has  signaling blocks at the time of going to press taproot failed to receive  support from miners in the last two signaling periods in the last difficulty epoch some mining pools had given mixed messages signaling with some blocks and not with others but this was likely because adding the infrastructure to signal takes time to roll out at a large scaleat the time of publication about  of mining hash power indicates support for taproot this is a large improvement over the  hash power support during the first signaling period late last week taproot signaling had reached  consensus although it was too late for the last signaling period it means taproot could be “lockedin” for activation during the current epoch if a similar consensus level is reachedthe previous underwhelming response of miners had been discussed on several bitcointalk forums many thought the slow response was caused by miners delaying software updatesaccording to a coingeek report it might take a while before  of the miners put their money where their mouth is and signal for taproot activation despite the verbal consensus although enough miners might start signaling for taproot activation in the current or a future signaling epoch the failure of the first two signaling periods makes it apparent that they are not as enthusiastic to embrace the change as their nearly unanimous verbal commitment would indicate
