despite a  that saw the price of bitcoin rise to alltime highs and set new records for stability it isn’t too difficult to find bitcoin fud being spread but recently released blockchain analysis demonstrates that the “bitcoin is for criminals” narrative is weaker than everthe fud keeps comingyesterday janet yellen the incoming nominee for us treasury secretary highlighted a common narrative that many believe shines an unfair light on the original cryptocurrency suggesting that the government will try and regulate its use“i think many  are used — at least in a transaction sense — mainly for illicit financing” yellen said “and i think we really need to examine ways in which we can curtail their use and make sure that money laundering doesn’t occur through those channels”last week european central bank president christine lagarde said that bitcoin is a “highly speculative asset which has conducted some funny business and some interesting and totally reprehensible money laundering activity”even some industryfocused publications have been spreading the “bitcoin is for criminals” fud without acknowledging the facts that criminals have been using fiat cash for much longer that supposedly regulated financial institutions frequently facilitate major crimes that anonymous cryptocurrencies would be much more useful for criminals than bitcoin or that there are many other arguments that suggest this narrative is unfaircryptocurrency is leaving criminals behindaccording to a summary of blockchain analysis firm chainalysis’ “ crypto crime report” the proportion of cryptocurrencyrelated crime fell significantly last year“in  criminal activity represented  percent of all cryptocurrency transaction volume or roughly  billion worth of transfers” the firm found “in  the criminal share of all cryptocurrency activity fell to just  percent or  billion in transaction volume”to put it another way cryptocurrency transaction volume that chainalysis could identify as “criminal” accounted for just  percent of all transactions in  though yellen seems confident in saying that the technology is “mainly for illicit financing” by far the highest proportion that chainalysis has found since  across  that figure was down to less than half of  percent fueled in no small part by a sharp rise in overall economic activitychainalysis did note that cryptocurrencyfueled ransomware activity grew  percent in  compared to  and that even this figure is probably low due to underreporting but this still represented only  percent of the total funds received by criminal cryptocurrency addresses which itself is a very small proportion of all cryptocurrency transactions across the year funds received through scams and darknet marketplaces were by far the leading categories for criminal transactions in it may be unlikely that the picture painted by this report will significantly alter regulators’ opinions of bitcoin or eliminate the appeal of fudfocused headlines and media coverage but there is a clear story being told by bitcoin’s  even if it’s not the narrative everyone will adopt btc’s journey to global reserve currency status will always outpace its use on the fringes of the dark webthe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc
