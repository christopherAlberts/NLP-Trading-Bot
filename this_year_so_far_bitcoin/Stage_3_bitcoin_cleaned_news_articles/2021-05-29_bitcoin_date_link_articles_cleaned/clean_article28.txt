for the purposes of historical comparison it’s also worth noting that the pattern of the dominance chart currently looks much like it did during the earlier part of as the markets have gone into meltdown since may  bitcoin btc dominance has fluctuated dramatically bucking ’s prevailing trend before the selloff started in earnest btc dominance had been falling pretty steadily from around  in january to a low of under  by the time the crash was underway at that point btc dominance was at its lowest since the summer of  it has since recovered to above if the same pattern is underway this time around then the market is likely to be at the equivalent of summer  when the alt season was just ramping up and still some months away from bitcoin’s price peak of around  in december of course while the patterns draw some interesting parallels btc dominance doesn’t necessarily tell that much about price but it does offer insights into how the flagship asset is performing in relation to the rest of the markets underpinning certain trends so what are the likely scenarios for btc dominance and what would it mean for the marketsfollow the money flowthe money flow model is one potential predictor of where the markets could go the model states that money flows from fiat into bitcoin and then down from large caps through midcaps to smallcap altcoins before redirecting back to btc and ultimately back to fiatthis model is interesting because it pretty much sums up what happened in  except that the cycle played out twice as btc surged toward the end of the year so if the  scenario repeats itself btc dominance could continue to rise until the flagship asset sees another price peak then fall as alt season accelerates once againalong with the eerie similarities of the dominance charts the behavior of the alt markets also offers some indication that they could be performing according to historical cycles in early may cointelegraph reported that altcoins had flipped their previous cycle high to support — a move that last happened in if the cycle repeats it could still launch the alt markets to stratospheric new heights in  while the performance observed during may may not offer much reassurance in this regard there’s also nothing yet to indicate that btc and the broader markets won’t perform according to longterm trends sam bankmanfried ceo of exchange ftx and alameda research told cointelegraph“if we enter a prolonged bear market i would expect btc dominance to rise as it did in – but the correction we’ve seen so far isn’t enough to trigger that”but waitfor individual investors looking to follow the money flow there is one big consideration speaking to cointelegraph robert w wood managing partner at wood llp warned “the elephant in the room for diversification is taxes” he added “up until  many investors could claim that a swap of one crypto for another was nontaxable under section  of the tax code but the law was changed at the end of ”indeed omri marian director of the graduate tax program at university of california irvine school of law confirmed that cryptotocrypto transactions are likely to trigger tax obligations explaining to cointelegraph“any reading of one crypto asset for another is a taxable event so whatever the profit motivation is a cryptoassets investor must account for the fact that rebalancing of the portfolio may have a tax cost”shane brunette ceo of cryptotaxcalculator put it into practical terms telling cointelegraph “if an investor switches between btc and altcoins the capital gainloss would be realized in this financial year regardless of whether or not they’ve ‘cashed out’ to fiat” furthermore he clarified that “the activity would reset the length of time the investor has been holding the asset which would impact the eligibility to claim a longterm capital gains discount”so be mindful that following the money flow may come with its own set of costs and as a result there are no guarantees that the pattern may repeat as new variables may have an effectthe unknown quantitythe most critical difference between  and now is the presence of institutions in the markets at least that’s true for bitcoin and to some extent largecap altcoins such as ether eth large swathes of the alt markets including almost all lowcap coins and memecoins like dogecoin doge are dominated by retail traders and investorsexamining the dominance charts btc seemed to get a boost at the end of  as institutional interest in cryptocurrencies started to pique its dominance continued to rise until around januarybut there’s some evidence that institutions could be behind the recent boost to btc dominance on may  it emerged that whales had bought  billion worth of btc while prices were below  two days later crypto hedge funds mvpq capital bytetree asset management and three arrows capital all confirmed they were dip buyersso there’s a chance that bitcoin’s sudden dominance recovery may not come down to regular market cycles but instead be influenced by institutional whales scooping up discounted btcriskoff but how farthe question is to what extent will the involvement of institutions make a difference to btc dominance patterns compared with what was seen in  perhaps the most critical difference between institutions and retail investors is that institutions are far more likely to follow prevailing market conditions and go riskoff accordingly therefore btc dominance is rising as investors choose to step away from riskon altsrelated for the long haul when bitcoin nosedived institutions held fasthowever based on the “buying the dip” reports it seems there’s no reason to assume that investors are going as far as going riskoff from crypto itself — at least for now furthermore bullish sentiments continue to swirl around undeterred by the market chaos of recent weeks as seen by the reports that interest in btc appears to still be on the risetherefore there’s still every chance that if interest in btc continues to hold and no major bad news comes in to destroy the sentiment around crypto the money flow model may still play out once again for now if history holds firm some further increases in btc dominance will take place before investors once again start to expand into largecap altcoins
