bitcoin and ethereum have fallen sharply previously few weeks nevertheless some imagine that the crypto bullrun isn’t over but and due to this fact depend on socalled flexible leverage indices fli – however what precisely are theytrading with leverage isn’t for the faint of coronary heart with bitcoin and co specifically issues can go incorrect and there are various merchants who’ve already misplaced quite a bit with leverage in addition each skilled leverage dealer has to carry out a mess of duties on the similar time he has to observe the varied metrics of his trades management his feelings function danger administration and nonetheless anticipate that trades can go incorrect at any time trading with leverage may be extraordinarily worthwhile however it additionally entails plenty of time and dangera brand new innovation from decentralized finance defi goals to vary that and make buying and selling with leverage simpler and safer we are speaking about socalled versatile leverage indiceswhat is a flexible leverage indexthe knowhow behind the fli tokens was designed by index coop index and the defi pulse group fli are structured merchandise in  format they allow merchants and buyers to carry leveraged positions on ethereum and theoretically all  tokens – in a decentralized and totally automated method since just about each crypto forex may be mapped as an  token it’s also doable with fli tokens to commerce bitcoin in a decentralized method on the ethereum blockchainthe fli tokens use a method and sensible contracts which might be primarily based on the set protocol and the compound lending protocol this makes it doable to generate an  token that robotically opens and manages leveraged positionssource thedefiant how  worksthere are presently solely two fli tokens  and  each of that are leveraged by an element of two and are presently solely out there on token units sushiswap and uniswapfor instance the  token has the next parametersunderlying asset wbtctarget leverage ratio defi lending protocol compoundmaximum leverage ratio minimum leverage ratio redeployment fee  this permits buyers to open a place on bitcoin that’s leveraged by an element of two by shopping for  tokens for instance if the bitcoin value will increase by   the value of  will enhance by   conversely this additionally signifies that  falls   if bitcoin data a value decline of   the precise methodology of  may be considered on tokensetsadvantages of flexible leverage indicesbasically fli tokens supply  benefitslower danger with leverage buying and selling not eradicated lower price burden easier to make use of compatibility with defi protocolslower dangertrading in leverage is dangerous and even felxible leverage indices can not change that but fli tokens can considerably scale back the danger of leverage buying and selling this is as a result of they’re designed in such a method that they always adapt to the given parameters and realign over time this can cushion even excessive volatility as sensible contracts robotically be sure that the collateral stays above the liquidation thresholds in addition each fli token is definitely secured with the underlying token – wbtc and usdc with  eth and usdc at  during the final bitcoin crash in midmay it was even doable that there have been no liquidationslower chargesanother benefit of fli tokens is that they’re cheaper in comparison with leverage gives on centralized exchanges as a result of their charges are decrease and there’s no slippagesource mestigoitmediumcomeasy to make use ofone of the best benefits of fli tokens is that they’re very straightforward to make use of they are very straightforward to purchase and may be saved in an ethereum pockets as a holder of a fli token you should not have to observe whether or not there’s a danger of liquidation as sensible contracts robotically monitor the entire thing for youcompatibility with decentralized financeanother nice good thing about fli tokens is that they’re totally appropriate with defi functions thats as a result of fli tokens like  and  are  tokens for this purpose the fli tokens will also be traded on decentralized exchanges reminiscent of uniswap or sushiswap theoretically nonetheless it will even be doable sooner or later to combine the tokens into a wide range of different defi protocols
