this is part two of a multipart series that aims to answer the following question what is the “fundamental value” of bitcoin part one is about the value of scarcity part two — the market moves in bubbles part three — the rate of adoption and part four — the hash rate and the estimated price of bitcointhe market moves in bubblesin recent months or even years there’s been a lot of talk about the bubbles developing in the bond markets newspapers — both financial and nonfinancial — talked about it with specialized television stations and prestigious “macroeconomists” from all over the world discussing how today’s world debt has negative interest ratesit is financially counterintuitive to have to pay or lend money to someone even if that person is a state we are experiencing an absurd situation that has never happened before in the financial market landscape the main cause is linked to the enormous liquidity injected into the markets by central banks which they use as funding to avoid their own bankruptcy only to then prudently reverse it back onto the states they themselves in difficultyafter all john maynard keynes’s famous phrase reads“financial markets can remain irrational for much longer than you can remain solvent”in actuality this absurdity has made it possible to avoid the bankruptcy of the financial system so it is welcome even though it feeds irrational phenomena such as bond markets with negative yields and therefore senseless bond prices and stock markets touching not all but most new highs day after dayone phenomenon that isn’t actually fueled by central bank money that everyone labeled a meaningless mega bubble in  is bitcoin btc the price of bitcoin rose to a high of  in december  coinciding with the launch of bitcoin futures by the chicago board options exchange and the cme group the two largest commodities exchanges in the world and then hit a minimum of around  in  effectively losing over  of its valuedoes it represent the bursting of a bubble sure does it represent the end of bitcoin certainly not could there be more bitcoin bubbles in the future of courseas always we would like to approach the problem as analytically as possible we reconstructed the table created by the founder of bitcoin satoshi nakamoto using excel to make sure that bitcoin was deflationary and not inflationaryinflationthe us dollar and all currencies in the world truthfully including the euro due to inflation is worth less and less over time we can better understand the phenomenon if we think about the value of assets buying a car  years ago cost about  times less than it does today so a nice car that cost  in  would cost  todaythis phenomenon is called inflation and it is induced by a rule that links the total value of goods in the world to the total currency in circulation if the number of us dollars in circulation doubles the same goods will tend to cost twice as much it “will tend” because currency is not a linear phenomenon and it may take some time to happenin the  and early  inflation in the united states reached rates close to  per year creating many difficulties for those who didn’t have the knowledge and the means to counter itdeflationbitcoin was created with a deflationary logic more similar to commodities such as gold and silver this is why it’s considered by many to be the new digital gold as it has preservation of value characteristics and not those of impoverishment like the dollar or the eurorelated is bitcoin a store of value experts on btc as digital goldlets see how it was possible to create and what the effects resulting from these choices arenakamoto decided that the maximum number of bitcoin created and available should be  million the number  will occur many times it is the greek letter phi which we will also talk about later he could have decided to enter a fixed amount of bitcoin for each block that got mined but doing so wouldn’t have created the exponential growth effect that characterizes bitcoin or at least not as marked as it is todayconsequently he decided to halve the amount of newly issued bitcoin every four years to create a very marked and interesting stocktoflow effect that would push the price higher and higherrelated bitcoin halving explainedfor the first  blocks miners were paid  btc for each block written on the distributed ledger at a time where the value of bitcoin fluctuated from a few cents up to a few dollars so the remuneration was not in the least comparable with that of today — neither was it as difficult to win the challenge in fact in the early years simple computers were enough to do the miningthe first halving took place in  — ie from the  block onward remuneration was halved to  btc for each writing on the distributed ledger in  the second halving took place which brought the remuneration down to  btc and again with the third halving taking place in may  bringing the remuneration for each block to  bitcoin which with a recent price correction of around  is still around related  good reasons why  is probably the bottom for bitcointhe next halving is scheduled for  when remuneration will be further cut by  it is set to continue probably until  the year in which the last halving is expected which will distribute less than  bitcoin in the last yearbut how does this halving phenomenon impact the price of bitcoin does the halving of the socalled “flow” or the flow of new capital into the market affect the price of bitcoin itself as we saw previously in the first part bitcoin seems to follow the stocktoflow model therefore a reduction in flow while maintaining the same stock should correspond to an increase in price now that we’ve had three halvings shouldn’t there have been as many bubblesdo you know how many bubbles bitcoin has had in its short life three fatalities they are represented graphically belowthese are the three bubbles bitcoin has faced so far and each time the next maximum price became at least  times higher obviously it is not a guarantee that it will do so in the future but there are many factors that lead us to believe that what we experienced in  will not be the last bubble — many more will follow in the futurecan this information be used to determine a correct price for bitcoin or at least a potentially achievable price according to this modelin fact we can if we take a look at this graph where the halvings are highlighted by jumps in the xaxis in correspondence with the change in status of halving we can estimate the fair value price — that is the correct price at which bitcoin could tend towardif the price of bitcoin tends to return around the line described in the figure above it is clear that we can estimate what the future target price of bitcoin will be based on the various halvings that await usfrom the graph it is clear that the target price of bitcoin is between  and  this information is very useful not only because it guarantees that we will arrive at those prices but because we should take into account our investment decisions as it could actually get there and even exceed those price levelsobviously these estimates must be taken as an intellectual attempt to understand the dynamics of bitcoin and absolutely cannot be considered a suggestion or advice from the author understanding how bitcoin can reach such values is not easy and anyone approaching this fascinating world for the first time would have a hard time imagining how a seemingly worthless asset could have such a high price especially if you fall into the trap of thinking of it as a dollarpar currencyto do this it is important to know its various aspects one that is certainly fundamental for determining the price of bitcoin is the adoption rate which is to
