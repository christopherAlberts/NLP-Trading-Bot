its still the wild west for the cryptocurrency market to date most owners of cryptos hold or trade them because they think they will go up in value few use them as a form of digital payment or for some other decentralized finance or defi use case  although that is quickly changingthe recent precipitous fall in crypto prices sent shares of both coinbase global nasdaqcoin and silvergate capital nysesi into a tailspin too but these two companies have emerged as promising leaders in this space one of them looks like the better buy right nowcoinbase what happens if crypto trading tanksshares of cryptocurrency trading exchange coinbase have struggled since its ipo in april the stock is trading more than  below its alltime high but the companys market cap still sits at about  billion as of this writing  a respective nine and  times fullyear  revenue and earnings per share if extrapolating first quarter  results through the rest of the year however with the recent tumult in crypto prices  bitcoin cryptobtc alone was nearly half its alltime peak value in midmay  there is investor concern that interest in trading cryptocurrencies could take a hitfalling crypto prices could certainly throttle coinbases growth first quarter  revenue was up an incredible  year over year the company earns a variable fee based on transaction size every time a trade is placed so higher crypto prices would equate to higher fee revenue but coinbases revenue isnt solely dependent on high crypto prices ultimately the number of monthly transacting users mtus and volume of trades are the biggest determining factor for the companys nearterm success and cfo alesia haas recently doubled down on the companys second quarter  guidance for trading volume to be similar or higher than it was in the first quarter in spite of recent turmoil new mtus continue to get added at a rapid pace for the record coinbase provided a wide range for  mtus of  million to  million compared to  million in the first quarter and only  million a year agoof course trading fees are a race to the bottom and coinbase is far from the cheapest trading platform out there just like what happened to stock brokerages coinbases trading fee bread and butter is subject to disruption from lowercost competitors but the crypto industry is young and still developing new products like cryptobacked loans debit cards cloud computing infrastructure for institutions and a marketplace for tokens which are used in applications built on blockchain the digital ledger cryptocurrencies are based on could help make coinbase a formidable leader in the industry for years to comeit will be a bumpy road along the way but coinbase is well positioned to withstand the wild ups and downs in the nascent digital currency space the company had  billion in cash and equivalents at the end of march and raised an additional  billion from the sale of convertible debt in may despite recent uncertainty from price volatility coinbase is worth keeping an eye onsilvergate capital a crypto banking platform youve never heard ofa few years ago real estate banker and lender silvergate capital foresaw massive potential for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology it launched the silvergate exchange network sen to enable realtime payments and cryptocurrency conversion when a crypto is exchanged for us dollars sen has been a hit total customers were at  at the end of the first quarter up from  at the end of  and  the year prior among its users is none other than coinbase as well as lots of trading exchange competitors like binance or kraken and institutional crypto asset managers tooits important to note though that silvergate is not a trade exchange like coinbase is its a bank it thus primarily makes money from banking fees and interestbearing securities based on customer deposits and because those deposits have skyrocketed in the last year along with crypto prices silvergates balance sheet has ballooned  giving it plenty of cash to deploy to make more interest income digital currency deposits were  billion at the end of march compared to  billion a year ago resulting net income was  million in the latest quarter up  year over yearthe value of customer deposits have likely taken a hit though for the same reason theres been concern for coinbases fee revenue crypto prices are down nevertheless silvergate was still in the process of deploying all of the new deposits it has amassed in the last year and sees plenty more sen user additions as well it also added new bitcoinbased credit products and could add other banking features to its platform following the last quarterly report it was announced facebooks usdollar backed digital currency diem formerly known as libra will exclusively be issued by silvergate diem was designed to power facebooks aspirations in digital payments if it takes off this could be an incredibly large new customer for silvergateafter shares took a hit along with bitcoin and other crypto prices silvergate trades at a pricetobook value of  and  times trailing  earnings per share based on a current market cap of just over  billion its a steep price tag for a bank stock but this is no ordinary bank this is a forwardthinking enabler of the new blockchainbased financial system that could have lots to gain if cryptocurrencies see widespread adoption in the years to comewhich is the better buyits important to bear in mind that cryptocurrencies and publiclytraded companies closely tied to their success are a speculative bet the sharp selloff in both coinbase and silvergate capital in recent months is proof of that investors should tread carefully and keep any investment in either company very small perhaps  or less of your total portfolio value so as to be able to buy more over time if cryptos do indeed continue their rapid developmentwith that said i like silvergates positioning it was an early entrant into cryptobased banking and counts coinbase and others as customers and it could be a beneficiary of facebooks experiment in digital payments coinbase has plenty of competition that could erode its fee revenue in the near term and monetizing digital assets in other ways could take a while to offset any losses in trading income for now silvergate capital gets my nod as the better buy
