and decentralized exchanges hold rigorous verification processes that can be very hard to pass projects have to match several factors on various exchanges these are not limited to but include project history existence potential in the crypto market feasibility possibility for adoption postlaunch analysis and more while these processes and thresholds may be necessary however they can be intimidating for younger projectslaunching on unicrypt is relatively straightforward for a project to list its token on unicrypt it has to launch its token and set a soft and hard cap furthermore the project can later specify the rounds for its presale note that the launchpad has a maximum of two rounds after the project has launched its token and specified the rounds for its presale it will specify the currency it prefers to raise with usdc usdt dai etc among several othersnote that the first round of the presale is exclusively available for unicrypt‚Äôs native token holders uncx or uncl typically these token presales often end within minutes however users must hold  of native tokens to participate the second round is inclusive for anyone although project teams can specify a whitelisted address listmoreover another important point to note is that projects launching their tokens must lock a minimum of  of the liquidity on uniswap however it is advised that platforms lock more than the minimum requirementunlike other centralized or decentralized launchpads unicrypt offers an entirely autonomous option that emphasizes inclusivity simplicity and fairness and gives
