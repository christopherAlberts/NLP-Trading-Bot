f inance has its squabbling tribes much like the rest of society a contest that attracts a lot of attention just now is the demographiccumdigital divide between crypto kids and fiat dinosaurs the crypto kids believe that blockchainbased finance is the future and a haven from the inevitable degradation of fiat money in the opposite corner are the titanosaurs of the fiat world the central bankers “i’m sceptical about crypto assets frankly because they are dangerous” said andrew bailey the bank of england’s boss this weeklisten to this story your browser does not support the audio element enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or androidthis is a good moment for the dinosaurs the dollar price of bitcoin the mainstay of crypto assets fell from  or so in midmay to around  in the space of a couple of weeks the steepest part of that decline came after tesla’s chief executive elon musk said his firm would suspend its policy of accepting bitcoin for purchases of its cars a pledge by chinese regulators to crack down on the mining of bitcoin gave the selloff additional impetusthe consequences have so far been few because there has been no visible collateral damage crypto has been widely seen as a sideshow in financial markets this view is too dismissive though crypto like gold is built on a collective belief about its value but so to an extent are all asset prices and crypto is moving past the point where it can be considered its own selfcontained worldto understand bitcoin’s ascent it helps to go back to the work of thomas schelling a nobelprizewinning economist and game theorist schelling contended that people are often able to act tacitly in concert if they know that others are trying to do the same many situations throw up a clue a “focal point” around which people can coordinate without explicitly agreeing to do so for instance if asked to pick a positive number people will offer a variety of responses—one seven  and so on but if asked to choose a number that others will also select there is a preponderant choice the number onethis insight applies to certain assets that lack intrinsic value the investment case for gold said schelling can best be explained as a solution to a coordination game gold bars have value because enough people tacitly agree that they do their value is bolstered by their scarcity and their longevity willem buiter a prominent economist once aptly called gold the “sixthousandyearold bubble” bitcoin is newer but similar yes the technology behind it is ingenious although ethereum the nextmostvaluable crypto asset arguably has the more compelling user case and yes bitcoin is used in transactions if no longer for tesla’s cars but its selling points are scarcity and fame it is a natural focal point as with gold you can make a theoretical case that it is proof against papermoney inflationthe latest gyrations seem to confirm that crypto is a walled garden unconnected with the rest of finance but if you look more closely a different pattern is emerging there is already a pathway linking crypto prices with gold flows into exchangetraded funds  etf s that invest in gold started to revive just as money was flowing out of bitcoin futures and etf s according to a recent analysis by nikolaos panigirtzoglou of jpmorgan chase a bank that suggests that institutional investors are shifting back into gold after a flurry of interest in crypto because bitcoin prices had risen too quickly viewed this way the fall of bitcoin and the revival of gold are a relativevalue trade within the broader set of inflation hedgesfurthermore it is hard to shake off the feeling that cryptocrashes now matter this is the third bear market in four years but a lot more money is now involved the market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies tracked by a specialist website coingeckocom was more than  in midmay a fortnight later it had fallen to  that is a big loss in anyone’s money crypto prices are creeping up again so those losses are already being eroded but at each new peak the asset class looms ever larger and a dollar lost in crypto investing is the same as a dollar that was once earned or borrowed—even if at present it is hard to know precisely who bears the lossthere is something else to consider cryptocurrencies are highly speculative assets it is thus hard not to think of their prices as a signal of shifts in risk appetite more broadly beliefs matter for all sorts of asset prices whether in dollars or bitcoin you might be able to dismiss this cryptocrash but the next one will be harder to ignore
