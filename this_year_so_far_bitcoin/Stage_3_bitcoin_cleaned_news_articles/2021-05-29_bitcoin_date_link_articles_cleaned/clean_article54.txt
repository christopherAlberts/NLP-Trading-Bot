investorplacewe can learn a lot from who’s selling bitcoin – and who’s buyingi see this mistake all the time and it still saddens me source shutterstock people buy a stock that has been doing well and they like its story and its potential then the market throws a shortterm curveball their way and the stock starts to sell off their investment goes from fun exciting and filled with profit potential to scary dangerous and possibly on its way to being a big loserinvestorplace – stock market news stock advice  trading tips so what do they do they bail out  best stocks for upcoming grads to buy and hold forever yeah they may intend to get back in but experience tells me they rarely if ever do they get caught waiting — waiting to see if it could keep dropping or waiting to see if a bounce is the real thing or it pulls back again by the time the bounce looks real they don’t want to pay up for it so they wait for a pullback — and even they may well pay more for it than where they sold it to begin with if we take a deep dive into who has done a lot of the selling in bitcoin’s latest volatility it sure looks as if it is a lot of those investors but who’s buying tells us much more… bitcoin’s recent drop has been sharp no doubt about it from midapril to midmay it fell about  from alltime highs above  to just above  and … it was still up  from where it was last summer a lot of people seem to forget that … or don’t want to mention it a variety of reasons sparked the selloff hotterthanexpected inflation dinged stocks and cryptos colonial pipeline paid hackers a ransom in bitcoin cccbtcusd to restart the pipeline giving fresh voice to the misguided notion that it is a vehicle for illicit activity the illicit activity in bitcoin is noting compared to what it is in dollars china reinforced a ban on cryptos after some hope that things were loosening up and there is elon musk the brilliant and controversial founder of tesla nasdaqtsla solar city and spacex tesla stopped accepting payment in bitcoin although i don’t believe anyone ever paid that way and musk tweeted about environmental concerns with the power required to mine bitcoins i think he was misinformed and maybe we’ll talk about that in a future moneywire it was a bit of a perfect storm with each event intensifying the selling momentum we’ve seen this before selling begins selling in the short term other investors see this and panic they sell first and ask questions later some of the selling is shortterm traders who understandably cut their losses and get out but a lot of it sadly is what are called “weak hands” — investors who aren’t really committed to the asset and are easily shaken out when things get bumpy we dove down into the recent selling and this again appears to be the case most of the selling appears to have been done by “younger” coins meaning the most recently purchased some investors — likely new to bitcoin — got excited about what they saw and decided to buy when a sharp correction occurred they panicked and bailed unfortunately i think they took losses in the short term that they wouldn’t have taken if they understood the big picture blockchain analytics firm glassnode does some good work and it unveiled bitcoin’s onchain activity basically its trading activity amid the “elon dip” after musk’s tweets in its commentary the firm noted “onchain we can observe a notable bifurcation of reactions with newer market entrants panic selling and realising losses whilst long term hodlers  appear relatively unphased by the news” i added the underline for emphasis another indication that recently purchased coins were sold is the very high number sold at a loss in fact glassnode noted that the number of coins sold at a loss was so high that it hit levels historically marking a bottom longtime readers know that i never invest based on trying to pick a bottom we can never tell a bottom until it is in you can see on the chart below that after nearly a year of more bitcoins being sold for profits the trend reversed sharply in the last few weeks not quite as sharply as when the  panic hit last march but definitely fast and furious there are two sides to every trade so any guesses who was buying at discounted prices the big money it sure looks as if some big buyers stepped in based on the overthecounter desk flows which is where the institutions trade plus the premium bitcoin pricing on coinbase nasdaqcoin versus other exchanges like binance exploded the same coin can trade at different prices on different exchanges a lot of the institutions use coinbase so the higher price seen on that exchange indicates a lot of institutional buying in the united states let’s also back up to right before the market tanked on may  to see what the smart money was doing the bearish sentiment on may  lasted for just a short period as “whales” decided it was time to buy the dip a whale owns between  and  bitcoins — so roughly  million at current prices that’s the big money and whales aggressively bought below  business intelligence firm microstrategy one of the first companies to invest its cash in bitcoin was one of those whales that took advantage of lower prices it scooped up another  million at an average price of  this clearly wasn’t the bottom but it shows that bigtime bitcoin holders were willing to step in around  now that bitcoin is under  i’m sure they are even more inclined to buy a firm i respect ark invest also bought the dip as did ray dalio the cochief investment officer of bridgewater associates the world’s largest hedge fund i believe that is his first bitcoin purchase regular readers know i am a bitcoin bull that hasn’t changed one bit and i expect even bigger gains from lesserknown altcoins that haven’t gotten  the attention bitcoin has here’s something else that hasn’t changed … i expect bitcoin to hit  it may fall more before it resumes its march to new highs but the transformative change enabled by blockchain and cryptos is so big that i am more confident than ever in higher prices bitcoin  would be a  increase from current prices and select altcoins should multiply their money even more that’s the nature of hypergrowth trends stocks and cryptocurrencies as long as their potential to transform much of our world remains on track i expect to see more big gains in the next five
