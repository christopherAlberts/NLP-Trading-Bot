spiral out — using the golden ratio and fibonacci sequence to predict bitcoin price cyclesthe leading crypto asset bitcoin has seen its value drop more than  from its alltime high above the  handle sliding to a low of  on may  while bitcoin is still down  during the last  days it’s hard to forecast where bitcoin’s value is going from here although a number of people leverage indicators like the golden ratio multiplier fibonacci sequence logarithmic growth curves and tools such as the infamous stocktoflow  price model to predict future bitcoin valuationspredicting bitcoin’s booms and busts with the number phimost people can’t predict the future and when it comes to bitcoin btc and the crypto economy in general as busts and booms are common moreover lots of times busts and booms are unpredictable except for a few occasions like specific news stories that shake investors however there’s a plethora of technical analysis tools charts and models that help a great number of people get ahead of the gamefor instance fans of technical analysis leverage the perspective of the golden ratio and fibonacci sequence in order to predict future bitcoin valuations essentially a trader will apply mathematics to things like bitcoin’s value and moving averages the golden ratio is also known as divine section divine proportion the number phi extreme and mean ratio and the golden number essentially in the “science of quantity” two quantities reach a mathematical divine section when their ratio is equal to the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantitiesthe golden ratio is equal to  and it’s not only used in mathematics but it also appears in architecture geometry and many natural elements then there’s the classical example of mathematics called the fibonacci sequence which is a sequence of quantities where a number is the addition of the last two quantities starting with  and  the golden ratio multiplier hosted on lookintobitcoincom gives a detailed description of how the multiplier works with the leading crypto asset bitcoin btc“bitcoin’s adoption curve and market cycles to understand how price may behave on medium to long term time frames” the website notes “to do this it uses multiples of the  day moving average  of bitcoin’s price to identify areas of potential resistance to price movements” lookintobitcoincom further addsmultiples are of the ’s price values rather than its number of days the multiples reference the golden ratio  and the fibonacci sequence          these are important mathematical numbers these specific multiplications of the  have been very effective over time at picking out intracycle highs for bitcoin price and also the major market cycle highsthe golden ratio multiplier as it is applied to bitcoin price predictions was invoked by philip swift when he published an article on the subject on june   the article titled “the golden ratio multiplier unlocking the mathematically organic nature of bitcoin adoption” helps a trader get more perspective on multiyear cycles“the article starts by noting how the  moving average has acted as an axis for bitcoin’s major market cycles – once we break out a new btc bull run begins” swift tweeted two years ago swift continued further by sayingthe new insight begins when that important moving average is multiplied by key numbers the golden ratio  and numbers in the fibonacci sequence  in doing so we are able to pick out almost all the major intracycle price highs in bitcoin’s history coloured lines and each market cycle top dotted lines see  bull run as a clear example of the ma multipliers acting as major resistance at the intracycle highsbitcoin’s numerical sequence like fibonacci poetry and nautilus shellsof course not everyone agrees with using the golden ratio and the fibonacci sequence to predict bitcoin busts and booms for instance alvaro fernández from the open insurance platform nsure network remarked “historically it seemed to be respected but how much could you trust it we might as well pass through the first accumulation high” other critics believe using the golden ratio and the fibonacci sequence is no different than using tarot cardsdespite the skeptics swift’s bitcoin tool the golden ratio multiplier is well respected and used by a myriad of technical analysts the golden ratio has been utilized since the time of the ancient greeks and many believe it’s deeply associated with the universe and nature similar to the golden ratio satoshi nakamoto’s invention is a renowned and irrational technology by design interestingly bitcoin’s epic price rise since it was first traded has followed the number phi and fibonacci sequence patterns intimatelyin the same way as the golden ratio multiplier the leading asset has followed succinctly with a “natural longterm powerlaw corridor of growth” according to harold christopher burger burger published a comprehensive article that discusses bitcoin’s logarithmic growth curves like swift’s golden ratio multiplier logarithmic growth curves can also give a trader an idea of when they can expect busts and booms and specific time frames but these tools have allegedly been debunked on occasion and the golden ratio is often considered a fairytalesimilar to the nautilus shell bitcoin’s price has often been associated with the golden mean and fibonacci sequence the nautilus shell is often compared and associated with the golden ratio but contrarian research and further considerations say that the famous shell shape is not a good example of the golden ratio logarithmic spiral found in nature studies show the nautilus shell has phi proportions but follows a  ratiowhat do you think about using the golden ratio and fibonacci sequence to predict future bitcoin prices let us
