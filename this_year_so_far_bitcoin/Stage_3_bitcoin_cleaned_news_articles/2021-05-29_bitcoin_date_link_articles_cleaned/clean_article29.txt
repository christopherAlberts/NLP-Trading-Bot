chia a ‘green’ cryptocurrency that recently grabbed eyeballs for being more environmentfriendly than bitcoin has been criticised for generating a lot of ewaste bitcoin mining requires highend computers to solve complex puzzles to earn coin rewards thereby it uses a ghastly amount of electricity and produces carbon emissions as much as a mediumsized country whereas chia does not employ the use of numerous computers as in bitcoin but it uses ample storage on the computer by design chia mining requires extra hard disk space for operation in order to farm chia the software is required to write a plot which is a large chunk of cryptographic data to the disk then the chia blockchain software gives a “challenge” every  seconds or so  times in a day if one gets a close enough answer to the puzzle two fresh chia tokens are given to him so it is essentially storagecentric mining that works by using numerous hard drives the more hard disks you fill the harder the challenges become and the more rewards you winbram cohen creator of bittorrent who launched chia explicitly wanted a “green cryptocurrency” that would work much like bitcoin and at the same time is not hazardous to the environment so he founded chia a storagecentric network thinking it will use less electricity he assumed that the users would use the reusable form of computer hardware and therefore end up producing fewer carbon footprintshowever the aspiring chia miners have already started investing in hard disks in vast amounts that some asian countries such as vietnam are reporting shortages of hard discs as per the website of newscientist nearly  million terabytes of hard disc space which is enough to store  billion movies is being devoted entirely to chiaminingchia has grown almost  exabyte  in the last  hours the scale of this is hard to comprehendcreating plots at this rate burns up the equivalent of one  samsung evo ssd every  seconds an exabyte is   drives or  in seagate usb drives pictwittercomsbqoymofad — rick branson rbranson may  because of the high demand for graphic cards the prices of computing hardware have been escalating above manufacturerlisted prices this is causing frustration among gamers and creatives who do not wish to purchase the hardware at such inflated prices because of those involved in the farming of digital currencyread all the latest news breaking news and coronavirus news here
