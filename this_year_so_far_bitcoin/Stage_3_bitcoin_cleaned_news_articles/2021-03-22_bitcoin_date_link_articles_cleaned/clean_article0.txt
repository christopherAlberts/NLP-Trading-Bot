the energy used by the network of computers that power the digital coin is comparable to that of many developed countries and rivals the emissions from major fossilfuel users and producers such as american airlines group inc and conocophillips according to a new report by bank of america corpbitcoin’s massive rally over the past year means it’s only getting worse for the environmentthe energy used by the network of computers that power the digital coin is comparable to that of many developed countries and rivals the emissions from major fossilfuel users and producers such as american airlines group inc and conocophillips according to a report by bank of america corp the level of emissions which have risen alongside a spike in bitcoin’s price have grown by more than  million tons in the past two years and when the digital asset is trading around  — which it’s done for much of this year — it uses about  of global energy consumptionmore worrisome according to the report titled “bitcoin’s dirty little secrets” is that rising prices may mean bitcoin’s energy consumption will soon rival that of some of the largest countries in the world“what i’m concerned about is the pace of growth in the demand for energy” francisco blanch head of commodities and derivatives research at bank of america and lead author of the report said in an interview “the rate of change is enormous — nothing is growing at this pace in the energy world”bitcoin has skyrocketed into the limelight during the  pandemic amid unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus that’s been a boon to morespeculative parts of the financial markets the world’s largest cryptocurrency surged almost  in the past year that’s meant greater energy use toobecause the coin’s supply is limited any excess demand could push prices even higher rising prices encourage more socalled mining activity and may consequently push  emissions up even more according to bank of americabitcoin transactions are processed by miners — crypto slang for companies that operate a vast array of computers miners compete to confirm transactions and get new coins awarded in return — but they require huge amounts of energy to run buoyed by increased competition only a handful of such firms — most chinabased — controlled about  of all the computing power on the network bloomberg news reported last yearaccording to bank of america it’s since become even more concentrated with roughly threequarters of socalled hash power now concentrated in the country that too is worrying to blanch as almost  of chinese electrical generation is derived from coalfired plants“right now this thing is taking a lot of energy and it’s possible that if everyone comes in and prices go higher then it’s going to be way more energy” he saidbut crypto fans argue bitcoin’s energy use is immaterial when placed within a larger context many say for instance that its carbon footprint is pretty negligible compared with that of cars power plants and factories and even as its price surges it’s hardly made a ripple in power markets according to analysts at bloombergnef“bitcoin miners use whatever power is available and the focus is absolutely on the lowestcost power possible” jaime leverton chief executive officer at hut  mining corp said in an interview with bloomberg televisionher firm’s mining operations are located in alberta canada where natural gas and wind are among the predominant energy sources “it’s a conversation that certainly needs to evolve over time and doesn’t accurately reflect how we talk about energy in other tech sectors” she saidnic carter a partner at cryptofocused venture firm castle island ventures said he expects bitcoin’s energy use in the long run to come almost exclusively from sources — including hydro and flared gas — that otherwise would go to wastestill “there’s a moral case to be made for bitcoin even in the presence of a carbon outlay which is it’s so useful for society” said carter by phone “the focus should be on making the grid greener in the aggregate not trying to take a lineitem veto and say this specific usage of society’s energy is illegitimate”
