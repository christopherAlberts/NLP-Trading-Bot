bitcoin is lacking key ingredients that would make it a useful currency as a result the crypto currency is essentially more of a substitute for gold than the dollar fed chairman jerome powell said monday“crypto assets are highly volatile — see bitcoin — and therefore not really useful as a store of value they’re not backed by anything they’re more of an asset for speculation” powell said during a webinar sponsored by the bank of international settlements“it is essentially a substitute for gold rather than the dollar” he addedstable coins are “an improvement” over crypto assets but their credibility comes from being backed by a sovereign currency he said“stable coins may have a role to play with appropriate regulation but that role will not be to form the basis of a new global monetary system” he said“a global currency governed by the incentives of a private company is something that will deserve and will receive the highest level of regulatory expectations” the fed chairman saidone day in the future the fed might develop a digital dollar powell said but not until after a lot of careful review and acceptance by the american public and governmentit would be better for congress to pass laws specifically authorizing the digital currency rather than for the fed to use existing authority he saidsome economists argue that a digital dollar would have been useful in the recent efforts to stimulate the economy during the pandemic theoretically digital dollars could instantaneously be sent out to americansread why the coming recession could force the fed to swap greenbacks for digital dollarsas he has in the past powell stressed the fed is in “goslow” mode about such groundbreaking technologywhile work is going on exploring the ramifications of a digital dollar powell stressed that no decision is looming“because we’re the world’s principle reserve currency we don’t need to rush this project — we don’t to be first to market” powell saidone concern powell mentioned is that americans would want to hold digital dollars during any crisis leading to potential bank runs out of paper currency“there is just a tremendous amount of thinking going on on how we can capture the potential benefits while also managing those potential risks” powell said
