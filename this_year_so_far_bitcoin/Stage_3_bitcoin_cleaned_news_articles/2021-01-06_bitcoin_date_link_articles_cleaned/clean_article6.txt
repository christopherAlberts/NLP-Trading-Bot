last year certainly qualifies as one of the most volatile in stock market history investors navigated their way through the widely followed sp  losing over a third of its value in about a month they also enjoyed a bounceback rally for the ages with the sp  hitting new highs less than five months after finding a bottom on march if theres one figure that stands out above all else its that  of the roughly  stocks with a market cap of at least  million ended  higher by at least  thats a headscratching number considering the magnitude of the recession caused by the coronavirus disease   pandemictheres no question that select equities and assets got ahead of themselves over the trailing nine months since the stock market bottomed however one investment looks to be the most dangerous of all that investment which i strongly believe should be avoided at all costs in  is cryptocurrency bitcointhis investment is nothing but troublethe largest digital token in the world by market cap hit an early morning high on jan  of  for some context bitcoin has doubled since nov  is up  since midoctober and has risen  over the  period bitcoins implied market cap of  billion now accounts for nearly  of the  billion in value tied up in more than  digital tokenswhy is bitcoin rallying search any number of social media platforms and youll get no shortage of responses from enthusiasts bitcoin bulls often suggest that its competitive edge community consensus and gamechanging potential to transform payment processing made this rally easy to predictas for me i dont believe bitcoin is unique in any way save for being one of the preferred investment mediums on cryptocurrency exchanges in other words if investors want to buy a lesspopular token theyll usually need to exchange their fiat currency to bitcoin first before making their purchase that my friends is the only true utility that bitcoin servesbelow is a growing list of reasons i believe bitcoin is the most dangerous investment of the concept of scarcity has been pulled out of thin airbitcoin bulls often point to its socalled hard cap of  million tokens as proof of its scarcity simple economics tells us that if demand for a good exceeds supply and supply is limited the price of that good should rise case closed rightnot exactlyyou see were not talking about a physical good being in limited supply bitcoins token cap is nothing more than an arbitrary figure plucked from thin air physical gold is considered scarce because we cant make any more gold than what can be found and mined on planet earth thats not the case with bitcoin community consensus could lead to an increase in the token limit the chance of this happening might be small but its not bitcoin offers the perception of scarcity and this falsity has helped drive its valuation highertheres minimal utilityyoull also hear about bitcoin being the future of global payments again this isnt entirely accurate or possiblewhile the number of businesses accepting bitcoin as payment is climbing the actual percentage of businesses willing to accept bitcoin is tiny according to financial services company fundera only around  us businesses accept bitcoin as payment yet the us census bureau finds there are  million businesses in the us including sole proprietorships even if we just counted businesses that have an employee thats  out of  million companies accepting bitcoinplus approximately  of bitcoin tokens are held by investors and kept out of circulation that leaves about  million bitcoin for transactions the value of these tokens is close to  billion in  global gross domestic product totaled  trillionbitcoin has no path to gamechanging utilityits not a store of valueno matter how much bitcoin enthusiasts want to equate bitcoin to gold its never going to be a store of valuestore of value assets usually have identifiable relationships to governmentbacked fiat currencies and they arent all that volatile for instance gold has an identifiable inverse relationship with the us dollar and its buoyed by physical scarcitybitcoin doesnt have any identifiable relationships to governmentbacked fiat currencies enthusiasts would like you to believe that an inflated us money supply is good news for bitcoin but that would only be true if it had some sort of likeforlike federal government backing and had true scarcity  neither of which is truebitcoin has also lost  of its value multiple times over the past decade including a handful of instances when it was halved in roughly a  period thats not how storeofvalue assets behaveyou have no ownership in the underlying blockchainbitcoin bulls are also quick to point out how bitcoins blockchain is revolutionizing the payment and settlement process while its true that blockchain offers plenty of intrigue buying bitcoin doesnt give token holders any ownership in the underlying architecture that might actually be worth somethingwhats more its foolish small f to assume that bitcoins blockchain is superior bitcoin may have firstmover advantage but there are hundreds of ongoing blockchain projects that offer possibilities beyond the financial spacetheres virtually no barrier to entryits also important to note that the cryptocurrency space has virtually no barrier to entry all it takes is some time and money to develop blockchain with or without a tethered digital currency there are exactly zero guarantees that blockchain will be adopted on a broad scale or that bitcoin will be in any way necessarythere are a number of blockchain projects in development that may work with fiat currencies or without a digital token at allits not just bitcoin thats dangerouskeep in mind that owning bitcoin isnt the only way you can gain exposure to this dangerous investment the grayscale bitcoin trust otcgbtc owns  bitcoin and essentially acts as a basket fund that investors can buy of course those investors will pay a ridiculous  fee annually for the right to buy the grayscale bitcoin trust and may have to buy in at a premium as in years pastlikewise business intelligence company microstrategy nasdaqmstr sunk more than  billion in balance sheet cash into bitcoin this cryptocurrency stock issued debt just to buy extra bitcoin meanwhile microstrategys sales through the first months of  were down  while its operating losses widenedput plainly bitcoin is dangerous its driven by shortterm emotions technical analysis and misinformation about its scarcity utility and longterm potential its the one investment you should strongly avoid
