anyone who’s tried to buy one of the latest and greatest graphics cards like the nvidia rtx  or amd’s big navi will know just how difficult it is unfortunately it could get even harder as bitcoin’s value alongside other cryptocurrencies has skyrocketed to new heights driving a rise in crypto miningas a result we may be looking at a repeat of the  graphics card shortage when exploding demand from prospective miners both created graphics card stock shortages and pushed the prices of available cards upwards this time though mining demand is compounding an existing shortage caused by limited supply and the efforts of scalpersas of  am et on january  a single bitcoin is valued at just over   breaking new records for the value of the cryptocurrency a month ago they were worth  each meaning their value has almost doubled since then and no doubt that number will continue to rise over the next few days as for etherum in the past week that spiked in over  in valueof course anyone who knows about cryptocurrency knows you don’t need to buy the coins to get in on the action anyone can “mine” new coins by completing blocks of verified transactions using free and simple opensource software you just need a machine that’s sufficiently powerful enough to get it donenow its worth noting that the underlying hashing algorithm of bitcoin means mining with gpus is rather inefficient its now better to use a system with an applicationspecific integrated circuit asic to mine bitcoin specifically however other cryptocurrencies such as ehterum still benefit from gpubased miningso the surging prices of such cryptocurrencies alongside bitcoin is set to generate more interest in the digital money and thus likely to see people look at using powerful graphics cards for mining weve seen this in the past skyrocketing cryptocurrency value leading to miners buying up whatever graphics cards they could get their hands onwhile graphics cards arent the best way to mine cryptocurrencies any more they are still in demand as wannabe miners try to cash in on cryptos increasing value plus tom’s hardware points out that the  nvidia rtx  could pay for itself in around  days of mining a  geforce rtx  ti would be paid off in almost half the time taking just  days to break evenas if the latest graphics cards weren’t almost impossible to find already now we have to deal with bots and crypto miners competing to buy them all if you’d been hoping to pick one up during the next big restock you’re probably going to be disappointedvarious cryptocurrency prices will drop eventually freeing up graphics cards for gamers but it’s impossible to predict when that’s going to happen you can still check where to buy the nvidia geforce rtx  but it’s going to be tough going for the foreseeable future
