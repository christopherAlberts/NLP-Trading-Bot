bitcoin industry is doing itself any favors by refusing even to accept its energy use is a problemsee more stories on insiders business pageas bitcoin surges to unprecedented value the sprawling matrix of computers around the world that run its software is now consuming as much energy a year as sweden the latest calculations suggestthe higher the price the more electricity this network uses iran was recently rocked by power outages that were partly blamed on bitcoin bill gates recently warned bitcoin was not a great climate thing us treasury secretary janet yellen has called its energy use staggeringconceived to defy central banks in the fallout of the financial crisis bitcoin started life so countercultural that no one really knows who created itit has soared from around  through most of last year to around  now thanks to investors who fear traditional currencies are set to lose value an influx of traders who speculate on the future price and elon musk who tweets that you can use it to buy teslas it is now seriously talked of as a potential new global reserve currencybut as wall street banks roll out bitcoin services they may find its environmental costs hard to balance with shareholders and customers who are increasingly conscious experts tell insider that bitcoin faces a like the cryptocurrency itself bitcoins community is decentralized defiant and nebulous no one can simply tell it to heed growing calls to reduce its carbon footprintalex de vries a dutch economist who created the bitcoin energy consumption index estimates the electricity used has doubled since  to between  terawatt hours twh and  twh a year more than half of bitcoin miners in china where most use coalbitcoin has no physical form mining refers to its network of computers finding new tokens by having them solve complex calculationshardware at the sberbit cryptocurrency mining equipment facility in moscow russia in  vyacheslav prokofyevtass via getty imagesnew tokens these calculations uncover are a reward to the miners for using their computing power and electricity to secure the network against hacks and record transactions on bitcoins decentralized ledger known as the blockchainas the price climbs those running the vast networks of computers dedicated to solving these calculations can sell them and direct more computing power toward the network creating a cyclical effect as they compete with other miners to find new bitcoin firstsee also bitcoin mining can be a bridge to a renewable energy future by supporting green projects a leading north american miner saysde vries thinks bitcoins energy use will continue to climb as the prices rises and miners buy more hardwarehe forecasts the network could soon consume a staggering  twh as much energy as all data centers globally and equivalent roughly to londonhe said potential investors may be put off by bitcoins eyewatering energy use adding i think this will be a major problem for bitcoinbut for bitcoin advocates the fact it allows people to make transactions semianonymously and without thirdparty approval outweigh the environmental costsnic carter a bitcoin investor and partner at cryptofocused venture capital firm castle island ventures told insider its energy use was not a new debatethe costs of the dollar system are harder to comprehend but they are extremely real he addedthe more bitcoin surges the worse the problem becomes alain pittonnurphoto via getty imageshe said that if investors conscious of environmental impact refused to buy bitcoin because it consumes energy — like every other utility on the planet — they are just doing themselves and their investors a disservicetwitter chief executive jack dorsey said late last year that cryptocurrencies will eventually be powered completely by clean power eliminating its carbon footprint and driving adoption of renewables globally  published estimates indicate bitcoin already consumes a significant amount of clean energybitcoin miners incentivized to use renewable energy by government subsidies have sought sustainable ways of fueling their computersone german company set up a mining facility under the fjords of norway using hydroelectricity to power its machines and the freezing water to cool thembut estimates of how much bitcoins overall energy use is green vary hugelyin a  study cryptocurrency asset management firm coinshares analysis concluded the bitcoin network gets up to  of its electricity from renewables but in a survey by cambridge universitys judge business school the same year only  of miners said that their power came from renewablesrenewables arent the only way to use less energyethereum the second largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin has a total value of  billion compared to bitcoins  trillion market capitalization and soared over the last year its energy demands spiked to  twh per year up from  twh  months ago according to de vries calculationsit sought to cut its energy use by moving to a proofofstake algorithm where instead of miners who create new tokens as a reward for securing the blockchain stalkers hold existing tokens and can commit – or stake – them to the network generating new tokens and helping to validate transactionsbut de vries said fixing bitcoins energy dilemma this way would be impossible without fundamental changes to bitcoinits miners and developers could vote for such a change but fundamental alterations to bitcoins core software are broadly unpopularone proposal to make bitcoin better suited to small payments in  caused such a schism that a group of miners decided to fork the blockchain and create a rival cryptocurrency called bitcoin cashfrances coppola an author on banking finance and economics told insider bitcoin needed to evolve if it is to solve the problemi dont think the bitcoin industry is doing itself any favors by refusing even to accept that bitcoins energy use is a problem let alone do anything about it she addedde vries added that if traders miners and advocates cannot address its environmental impact government action seems like an inevitable outcomebitcoin may be set up to be distanced from authorities but as hundreds of thousands dream of following its early investors into the ranks of the worlds richest it is attracting the type of attention governments cannot ignoreindia has proposed fining anyone who trades or owns bitcoin as us treasury secretary yellen condemned its energy use she also warned investors it was extremely inefficient and often for illicit financebut de vries added that whatever happened bitcoin would likely survive in some formhe said it would continue to exist as long as some people think it has value  it may just not be the same market value as it has today
