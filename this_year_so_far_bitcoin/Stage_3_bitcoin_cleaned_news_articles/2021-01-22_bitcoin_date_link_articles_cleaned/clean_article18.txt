generously subsidized electricity has put the country on the cryptomining map given the operations enormous electricity consumption electricity goes for around  cents per kilowatthour in iran compared to an average of  cents in the united statesiran is among the top  countries with the most bitcoin mining capacity in the world   megawatts a day the us network has a daily capacity of more than  megawattson tehrans outskirts and across irans south and northwest windowless warehouses hum with heavy industrial machinery and rows of computers that crunch highly complex algorithms to verify

hand the government worries about limiting how much money is sent abroad and controlling money laundering drug sales and internet criminal groupsiranian cryptocurrency miners have been known to use ransomware in sophisticated cyber attacks such as in  when two iranian men were indicted in connection with a vast cyber assault on the city of atlanta on thursday british cybersecurity firm sophos reported it found evidence tying cryptominers in irans southern city of shiraz to malware that was secretly seizing control of thousands of microsoft serversiran is now going after unauthorized bitcoin farms with frequent police raids those who gain authorization to process cryptocurrency are subject to electricity tariffs which miners complain discourage investmentactivities in the field are not feasible because of electricity tariffs said mohammad reza sharafi head of the countrys cryptocurrency farms association despite the government giving permits to  investors only a couple dozen server farms are active he added because tariffs mean bitcoin farms pay five times as much for electricity as steel mills and other industries that consume far more powernow miners say the governments decision to close down major bitcoin farms operating legally seems designed to deflect concerns about the countrys repeated blackoutsas tehran went dark last week a video showing industrial computers whirring away at a massive chinese cryptocurrency farm spread online like wildfire prompting outrage about bitcoins outsized thirst for electricity within days the government closed that plant despite its authorization to operatethe priority is with households commercial hospitals and sensitive places said mostfa rajabi mashhadi spokesman of irans electricity supply department noting that illegal farms sucked up daily some  megawatts of electricityalthough bitcoin mining strains the power grid experts say its not the real reason behind irans electricity outages and dangerous air pollution the telecommunications ministry estimates that bitcoin consumes less than  of irans total energy productionbitcoin was an easy victim here said kaveh madani a former deputy head of irans department of environment adding that decades of mismanagement have left a growing gap between irans energy supply and demandbitcoin minings energy footprint is not insignificant but these problems are not created overnight he said they simply need one trigger to spiral out of controla sharp drop in supply or spike in demand like this winter when more people are staying home because of the coronavirus pandemic can upset the balance of a grid that draws mostly from natural gas authorities reported that households have increased their heating gas usage by  this year which tehrans electric supply company said led to limitations in feeding the countrys power plants and a lack of electricitysanctions targeting irans aging oil and gas industry have compounded the challenges leaving iran unable to sell its products abroad including its lowquality highsulfur fuel oil known as mazut if the hazardous oil isnt sold or shipped it must be swiftly burned  and it is in  of the countrys power plants according to environmental official mohammad mehdi mirzai the smouldering fuel blackens the skies particularly when the weather cools and wind carries emissions from nearby refineries and industrial sites into tehranduring the power blackouts thick layers of pollution coated mountain peaks and hovered over cities with readings of dangerous fine particulate pollution spiking to over  micrograms per cubic meter a level considered dangerously unhealthyas the government publicized its clampdown on bitcoin farms miners balked at all the blame over their energy guzzling many warned that despite its potential to become a cryptocurrency utopia iran would continue to fall behindthese moves harm the country said omid alavi a cryptocurrency consultant many neighbouring nations are attracting foreign
