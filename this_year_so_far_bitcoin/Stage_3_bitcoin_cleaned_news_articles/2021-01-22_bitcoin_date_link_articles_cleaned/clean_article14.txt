the bitcoin community is debating the extent to which bitcoin core developers and maintainers should shoulder the symbolic burden of hosting its white paper particularly when doing so could unnecessarily sap their time and financesthe question arose after the bitcoin white paper was taken down from bitcoincoreorg a canonical repository for the bitcoin software and educational resources like satoshi’s  thesis following legal threats of copyright infringement from nchain chief scientist craig wrightwright who has made a career of his claim that he is satoshi nakamoto also helped to spawn the bitcoin fork bitcoin satoshi’s vision bsvthe bitcoin white paper titled “bitcoin a peertopeer electronic cash system” was published by satoshi nakamoto under an mit public license in  and is distributed widely in many forms around the world wright has filed a copyright claim and that claim has been processed but it is still open to challengebut whether his legal pressure has merit is not the issue wright is no stranger to lawsuits and has eagerly sued prominent bitcoiners like british podcast peter mccormack for challenging his claim as the inventor of bitcoinsubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policythe issue is whether it would be best to entertain another of wright’s enervating but expensive lawsuits with a show of strength or if sidestepping the problem entirely by removing the white paper – which exists in numerous corners of the web anyway – would be a wiser path for bitcoincoreorg to followwhile bitcoincoreorg’s maintainers have scuttled the white paper from the site bitcoinorg the other website in the lawsuit’s sights has yet to remove the white paperas to the matter of practicality vs principal as ever bitcoin’s opensource community is at odds with itselfno harm no foulprolific bitcoin contributor gregory maxwell for instance is in the camp that argues hosting the white paper on the bitcoin core website carries unneeded legal and financial risk for the bitcoin core developers who maintain the site“it’s not currently needed there the bitcoin white paper is already all over the place it is on dozens of sites it is in the bitcoin blockchain and with publicity about this nonsense it’s going to get published in  more places”the fuss is over a digital paper maxwell points out not even the bitcoin code itself which will chug on entirely unaffected by the brouhahawright might be able to abuse the legal system to take a copy down or even to take down bitcoincoreorg entirely maybe even bitcoinorg entirely and what effect would that have on bitcoin none no effect at all what effect would it have on the availability of the whitepaper if anything it would make it more available but even if he managed to get the whitepaper taken off every site – a total impossibility – what would that do to bitcoin still nothing greg maxwellhe adds that instead of distracting bitcoin engineers with years of hearings and lawsuits costing millions of dollars it would be better to allow them the freedom to continue their important work maintaining bitcoin he cites mccormack’s and other cases as evidence that wright has plenty of money to throw at court hearings that go nowhere and he’s even failed to pay legally mandated restitution after losing these fights maxwell says in the posta matter of principle and prideresponding to maxwell’s post cobra a pseudonymous developer who maintains the bitcoinorg website disagrees with maxwell’s conclusion that “this isn’t the right battle” where maxwell thinks it would show weakness to engage with wright cobra believes submitting to the demand is weakness as well“with respect to greg i think the bitcoin core project submitting to unreasonable demands that lack merit is a bad thing and doesn’t inspire confidence in the robustness of the project to social and legal attacks” cobra told coindesk over direct messagecobra told coindesk the developers are willing to go to court to combat wright’s “nonsense” allegations if necessarycan’t sue ‘em allother bitcoiners in response to a post by bitcoin core lead maintainer wladimir van der laan orionwl were more sympathetic“y’all made the right decision” pierre rochard nakamoto institute cofounder and bitcoin strategist at kraken responded “thank you for your excellent stewardship of the project”decentralizing bitcoin corestill some suggested that van der laan and other bitcoin core developers who would rather avoid legal conflict should pass the bitcoincoreorg domain on to someone who is willing to bear the litigious brunt of a potential lawsuitin a blog post yesterday bitcoin core’s lead maintainer made it clear that in his view this goes further than the debate over taking down the white paper that in itself is likely to be a battle that will need broader support than one person could handle aloneindeed he had already begun considering “decreasing  involvement” in the open source project prior to this week’s eventsthe “responses on social media” to bitcoincoreorg’s delisting the white paper he writes in the post “have made me realize that people have strange expectations from me and what my role in the bitcoin core project is”van der laan will be stepping down as chair of bitcoin core’s weekly meetings for the rest of the post he proposes ways to further decentralize bitcoin’s development and software distribution“some arrangements that were acceptable for a small scale foss project are no longer so for one running a  billion dollar system market cap is famously deceptive but my point is not about specific numbers here” he writes
