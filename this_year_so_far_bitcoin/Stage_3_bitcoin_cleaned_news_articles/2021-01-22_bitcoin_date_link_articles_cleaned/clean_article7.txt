bitcoin continues to dominate the financial news as each price increase is deemed ‘recordbreaking’ by the media bitcoin’s rise has been an incredible experience to witness i first became invested in bitcoin when it was at  i consider myself a fairly early adopter — i saw and more importantly understood the longterm potential of bitcoin as soon as i was introduced to itwith the current surge in the price of bitcoin i believe this is only the beginning companies that integrate bitcoin now will have a major advantage over those that don’t take the time to truly understand what it is and how it’s positioned to completely change currency as we know iti’m not going to talk about what bitcoin’s current price is or how much it’s gained recently — that data can be easily seen using this index and live chart resource what i do want to touch on though is why bitcoin’s price is increasing and hitting alltime highs on an almost daily basisbitcoin’s supply is a key factor in driving its pricethe us dollar can be printed at any time flooding the market with new currency bitcoin however is limited — as in you cannot simply turn on a printing press and inject more of it into the economybitcoin has an engineered fixed supply created through mining a system that rewards those who process transactions on the blockchainthrough mining new bitcoin is created at a set rate that continuously becomes slower over a fixed period of time — the last bitcoin is set to be mined in may of  with roughly  of the total supply left to be mined bitcoin’s design of scarcity is in full effectas bitcoin becomes more understood buying interest has shifted from mostly individuals to now include institutional buyers with this demand to own a single bitcoin continually increasing combined with its limited supply the price is set to continue to rise for the foreseeable futureinflation and the stimulus bills are driving down the dollar’s valuethe us has been freely printing money for years and now more than ever it’s having a major impact on the dollar’s declining value we are now in the middle of the second stimulus bill and these combined with the paycheck protection program has resulted in trillions of dollars being introduced into the economy to help those impacted by  and the pandemici’m not saying the stimulus bills and help for small businesses wasn’t warranted — it was needed desperately businesses were forced to shut down and jobs were lost but the increase in money will greatly diminish the dollar’s value longtermincreased spending fueled by the stimulus funds has many predicting major rates of inflations which makes perfect sense investors and traditional financial institutions need to find ways to hedge against this and bitcoin is one asset that is going to at the very least maintain its value although recent activity shows that it has appreciated considerably during the pandemicbitcoin’s future volume is already established — how many will ever exist is already written into its code at any time you can verify with complete certainty how many exist present and how many will exist in the future this is the only currency on the planet with a limited and fixed supplyquincecreative  pixabayto understand bitcoin’s potential you need to understand halvinghalving is something that is built into bitcoin’s code and once you understand it you will see why it has such incredible potential and why interest has spiked in the middle of stimulus rounds that are greatly diminishing the dollar’s valueevery time  blocks are mined the reward extended to miners for processing bitcoin transactions is cut in half this will continue until the entire supply of bitcoin is released —  million in total and that amount is estimated to be  million at the time of this writing —  of the total supply is already in the marketwhy is this important to know it’s no secret that the us isn’t afraid to print more currency and there is a consistent amount of gold being mined annually halving ensures that bitcoin will never fall victim to the inflation issues that face the us dollar and other assets with a projected consistent longterm supply such as goldinstitutional adoption of bitcoin is happening right before our eyesmany traditional financial institutions are buying bitcoin rather than holding onto cash massmutual a fairly conservative
