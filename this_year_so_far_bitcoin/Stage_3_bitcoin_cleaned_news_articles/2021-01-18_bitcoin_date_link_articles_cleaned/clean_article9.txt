coinsource is expanding the network of bitcoin atmsits easy to see the bitcoin price go up and feel like you’ve missed the boat however many individuals and institutions believe that bitcoin is just now starting to heat up so what is driving the price of bitcoin so high and how could it continue to rise beyond these levels the best place to start is by understanding the backbone of bitcoin economics supply and demandsupply and demandthe problem with projecting future prices stems from the difficulty in predicting supply and demand bitcoin is unique in that its supply is on a known schedule it is embedded in software code that cannot be changed by any person or organization this code states that the new supply of bitcoin is cut in half every four years the first mining subsidy halving occurred in  when the new supply was cut in half to  coins released approximately every  minutes in  it was cut in half again down to  new coins created every  minutes in may  the most recent halving occurred meaning there are now only  new coins created every  minutes in short the new incoming supply of bitcoin becomes increasingly scarce as time goes onlets compare the mechanics of bitcoin with something like the price of cars if theres a huge increase in demand for cars there would initially be a shortage and the price would shoot up however the car producers can react by manufacturing more cars once this new supply of cars is available the price will come back downnow imagine what would happen if the new supply of cars was strictly limited only  new cars could be created each year there simply would not be enough cars to go around so the price would go up and not come back down what if we go even further and cut the annual supply of new cars in half so that only  new cars could be created each year it may lead to a mania in the price of cars as people start to realize that owning a car is becoming increasingly difficultthis upward price mania is effectively what happened to bitcoin in  to   to  and thus far in  to  the supply of bitcoin stays constant for a fouryear period then all of a sudden it is cut in half the impact is small at first but as more and more people learn about bitcoin there are an increasing number of buyers chasing a decreasing level of new supplythe exponential growth of bitcoins price can be a bit hard to grasp so lets see what it looks like with charts heres bitcoin from  to  with the exponential growth phase circled in redand heres another chart showing bitcoins price from  to  notice how the exponential price increase from  circled in red now looks insignificant the  exponential growth phase is circled in bluefinally heres a chart that catches us up to todays price levels the current exponential price increase is circled in green while the  and  price rises are circled in red and blue respectively notice how the first rise is just a blip on the radar and the second rise is also starting to look insignificantif the price of bitcoin follows its pattern following the previous supply halvings the blue circle above will soon become almost as tiny as the red circle this lines up with price predictions from many industry leaders citibank projects the price of bitcoin will reach  guggenheim says  jp morgan claims  and the list goes onisnt this too good to be truebitcoin may feel too good to be true because it is such a unique opportunity almost every new technology is first available to the wealthy and wellconnected before everyone else televisions cars and computers were first owned by the ultrawealthy only later to be owned by the masses similarly almost every new investment is first available to the top  percent most companies are first privately funded by venture capitalists and accredited investors only later to become publicly available via the stock marketbitcoin reverses this trend it can be acquired by anyone with an internet connection in some ways an average person can more easily store their wealth in bitcoin than jeff bezos can while the average person can simply download an app and buy bitcoin bezos would likely require a direct relationship with a large bitcoin exchange as well as a complex plan for securing hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin while not fully available to all of humanity not everyone has an internet connection bitcoin is the most widely available early stage technology in our lifetime and perhaps in modern historyof course bitcoin is not a guaranteed success in its early stages the internet was not a guarantee and neither was the printing press however bitcoins globally decentralized nature makes it difficult to kill it has no leader to attack or bribe it is not a company that can get overleveraged and collapse it is not reliant on a few key customers and it cannot be disbanded simply because a world leader doesnt like it bitcoin continues to exist because people and companies across the globe use it and work on it  while global bitcoin adoption is not a certainty it is continuing to grow at an exponential pace both in terms of price and number of users the internet followed a similar path in its early days at one point fewer than  percent of people in the world had internet access because of these low ownership levels the internet was slower and less useful than it is today currently around  percent of the global population is an active internet user right now global bitcoin ownership covers less than  percent of the world’s population if the global network effects that escalated the internet to widespread adoption are similarly boosting bitcoin toward global ownership we are not too late to get into bitcoin at all in fact we may still be very earlythis is a guest post by mitch
