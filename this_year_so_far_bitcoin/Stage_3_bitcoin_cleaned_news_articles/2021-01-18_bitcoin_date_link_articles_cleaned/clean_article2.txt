dear pennymy wife and i have an agreement where we each are allowed to spend  a month however we choose we have emergency savings we both contribute to our retirement accounts and we have college savings plans for both of our kidsi’ve recently started using my  to invest in bitcoin and my wife is furious she hates bitcoin because i lost money on it a couple years back but i only jumped back into it in august and already i’ve tripled my moneyif we’re allowed to spend our money however we want shouldn’t i be allowed to invest in bitcoin she’s wasted money by buying too many clothes and doing diy projects that would have been cheaper just to pay someone else to do i’ve never complained because it’s her should i keep investing even though my wife hates itcrypto chrisdear cryptoi’m torn if you both agreed that you get to spend  each month however you choose i guess that means you’re allowed to blow it all on bitcoin if you want but i’m with your wife because i really detest bitcoini’ll spare you a longwinded rant but what i will say is this when you invest in a stock you’re buying a stake in a company that hopefully produces something of value that’s not the case with bitcoinforget all the talk about it being the payment method of the future only about  businesses in the entire us accept it its wild price swings make it useless as a currency just in the first  days of  bitcoin soared to a record  on jan  then past  before tumbling by  percent in the next  hours imagine if the us dollar lost  percent of its value in  hours as longtime crypto critic warren buffett has said “you can’t do anything with it except sell it to somebody else but then that person has the problem”it’s fine if you disagree with me you can even disagree with warren but i’d urge you not to go against your wife if she’s really against thisyour problem is way bigger than bitcoin here you say you’re each allowed to spend  however you choose but you don’t really mean that do youyou’re fine with your wife’s decision to use her discretionary cash to buy clothes and diy materials it’s not how you would spend your money hopefully these purchases bring her happiness so it’s money well spent to younow let’s imagine your wife opted to burn her cash each month just because it’s her money surely you wouldn’t be okay with that that’s money you’ve both earned spending it purposefully is a show of respect for each otheri get it that’s not what you’re doing here you’re spending money on bitcoin because you think it will make you more moneybut your wife has already seen you make a losing bet on bitcoin once before i wish i knew more about the circumstances there was the money you lost limited to your personal budget or did you put a substantial amount of your family’s fortunes into this highly risky investmentregardless i’m guessing watching your money evaporate a couple years ago was stressful when we’re under pressure we tend to radiate stress to those around us so even if your losses were limited to your spending money don’t try to pretend that your wife and kids weren’t affected when you made a losing betclearly it’s time for you and your wife to set a few ground rules for how you each spend your  try talking about what your goals were when you decided to allocate spending money for each of you my guess is it was to give each spouse permission to spend on something that brings them joy if you’re truly passionate about bitcoin i suppose you can make the case one more time to your wife but i suspect that your main driver here is your desire to make a quick bucki do like that you’ve made a budget that includes personal spending money for each of you what you need is a veto power you each should avoid criticizing how the other spends their  in general but if one of you wants to spend money in a way the other spouse finds truly objectionable you’ll agree that it’s off limitsbitcoin returns are extremely fickle but the cost of going against your wife’s wishes every month is both predictable and incredibly high remember the saying “happy wife happy life” you’re far better off investing your  bucks in a new hobbyrobin hartill is a certified financial planner and a senior editor at the penny hoarder send your tricky money questions to askpennythepennyhoardercom
