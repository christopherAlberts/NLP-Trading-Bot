 reasons bitcoin is the best inflation hedgeinflation is a growing problem especially after the latest and largest annual increaseis still considered a “bubbleclass” by many expertsbtc is physically portable fast globally distributed and accessiblehowever btc price volatility weakens its store of value sov attributesthe ideological differences between communism and capitalism are many however the two quotes bellow from historical examples of each economic model seem to agree on at least one point – inflation devalues money“the way to crush the bourgeoisie is to grind them between the millstones of taxation and inflation”  vladimir lenin former premier soviet union“in the absence of the gold standard there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation there is no safe store of value”  alan greenspan former chairman us federal reserveinflation is a growing problem especially given the recent surprise announcement from the us department of labor that the consumer price index jumped  percent during the past  months – marking the largest annual increase since september for millennia gold has been viewed as the selfdefining “gold standard” as an inflationary shield compared to various asset classes that remains true today with more than  trillion invested in gold globallykey differencesin comparison at less than  trillion in current value bitcoin is still dismissed as a “bubbleclass” asset by  percent of financial experts recently surveyed by bank of america nyse however a lot has changed since bitcoin was created more than  years ago and it could be the best investment alternative to knock the reigning inflationary hedge from its golden throne to the benefit of individual investors alikekey bitcoin differentiators include physical portability – billions in btc can be carried in a secure crypto wallet that fits in a coat pocket while one billion of gold bars is estimated to weigh about  tons this is relevant because during the hyperinflationary period that plagued the weimar republic after world war i it took wheelbarrows full of germany marks to buy a loaf of bread paying with gold would be just as impractical transfer speed – any amount of btc can instantly be transferred from persontoperson but not so with gold this unique attribute results in lower transaction fees elimination of settlement delays and the removal of thirdparty intermediaries during inflationary cycles getting resources faster and at lower cost is critically important for struggling families or businesses global distribution – any amount of btc can digitally be moved to anywhere in the world with internet access conversely the maximum amount of gold that can be moved across the us border is  and larger amounts require us customs declaration and filing a fincen  form this attribute makes bitcoin an ideal deflationary lifeline for individuals struggling in hyperinflationary countries such as venezuela zimbabwe and sudan accessibility – all you need to buy btc is a payment method coin exchange and internet connection this allows the “unbanked” masses struggling with inflation or corrupt monetary systems the opportunity to sidestep fiat currency obstacles within their home countries thanks to the promise of financial democratization bitcoin offers by comparison securing any amount of physical gold requires a much more complicated process due to its general lack of use limited availability and secure storage requirements store of value sov – btc has many of the sov properties of gold such as scarcity fungibility proven appreciation widespread acceptance…etc while bitcoin can’t be turned into jewelry like gold btc has other unique features that distinguish it from gold for instance bitcoin can be split into subunits much easier than any type of physical gold bitcoin can also be staked instantly transforming it into an interestbearing asset that can also be collateralized – a feat that’s much more difficult to do with gold bitcoin is much easier to convert to other assets compared to physical gold lastly despite the recent twitter rantings of tesla nasdaq  founder elon musk bitcoin production uses about half the energy resources annually as gold productionwhile bitcoin is down more than  percent from it’s alltime highs earlier this year and investor sentiment toward it is negative its fundamentals have not changed in fact president biden’s newly announced  trillion federal budget only solidifies the case supporting bitcoin’s deflationary properties coupled with the fact that the us treasury department has been working overtime printing dollars at an unprecedented rate – nearly  trillion in  alone pushing the global total to nearly  trillion in circulation – the specter of inflation is not going away and bitcoin may be the best protection availableon the flipsidedespite the fact that bitcoin has generated triple digit returns annually for every year it’s existed its price volatility does weaken its store of value attributescritics of bitcoin continue to rail against its high levels of energy consumptions despite the recent formation of the bitcoin mining council in the us
