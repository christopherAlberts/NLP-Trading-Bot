bitcoin energy consumption explainedin  on the verge of the popping of the dot com bubble  anyone involved in technology was awakening to the nearendless opportunities that the internet and home computing could provideat the same time we saw activists and journalists and anyone who’s incentivized to create panic talk about the terrible energyintensive world we were creating by using computers statistics suggested that a pound of coal would need to be burned to store  of data and that in   of all electricity produced would be used by the internetin hindsight it’s clear that these figures were incredibly far off so should we apply a little more consideration into saying that bitcoin’s energy consumption is excessive unsustainable or the results of bitcoin mining is bad for the environmentthese concerns aren’t new to bitcoiners even satoshi himself had to address these energy consumption concerns so let’s deep dive into why bitcoin uses energy and how it’s usedthe value in bitcoin using energybitcoin was not the first centralized or decentralized digital currency that we’ve tried to build in fact it has over  years of prehistory david chaum created digicash in  but the business faced technological problems that forced them to centralize in retrospect perhaps the biggest problem with centralized private money is that if the business goes under the digital money becomes worthless because all of its databases and ledgers are no longer available to the public or even onlinethe second major problem we faced while building a digital currency is that digital data can be fairly easily copied with enough time or money and sometimes with little effortso in  satoshi took the ideas behind digicash and a few other sources and put together what we now know as a blockchain and bitcoinlet’s take a look at what he used and how he did itsecuring the network it is money after allhow do we secure the network and how do all the participants in the network verify transactions and know that all participants are being honest and not creating false transactionsthe simplest proposal might be that you allow a bunch of computers to form a network if the majority of the computers agree that a transaction has taken place or agree on the general network rules then all is goodthere’s a small flaw with this approach if every computer on the network had equal voting power it would be relatively cheap and easy to buy enough computers to control the network by purchasing thousands of lowcost computers like raspberry pisonce the persons that control the new majority are connected to the network they could mint new coins doublespend or do a number of other things that would damage the integrity of the network this type of attack is called a sybil attacksatoshi realized that blockchains could be resistant to this type of sybil attack if there was a cost to run a node on the network so inspired by dr adam back’s proposed hashcash proofofwork algorithm he implemented proofofwork on bitcoinby implementing proofofwork nodes on the network that mine transactions are made to try to solve a computationally difficult mathematical puzzle the puzzle difficulty gets more and less difficult every two weeks depending on the total computational power of the network which is measured in hashes per second hs this feature is known as bitcoin’s difficulty adjustmentsatoshi then chose to reward these nodes for their work by offering them a block reward of  bitcoins for every puzzle they successfully solve before another mining node doesso we have a cost to validate transactions on the network and a reward for validating those transactionslastly we need to consider that the more computing power introduced to the network the more transactions cost to mine computing power and energy are positively correlated so the more computing power is required the more energy is consumednow this might feel like an endless cycle of increased computing power and energy use still mining nodes are businesses that are economically incentivized to run efficiently so increasing their computing or hashing power and increasing their electricity costs without having to wouldn’t make economic senseso the bitcoin network isn’t using more power than it needsthis model of increasing difficulty as the network’s hashing power increases is what makes bitcoin secure and resistant to anyone attempting to take control of the network because they need to buy enough computing power to equal at least  of the network’s computing powerif we consider that the bitcoin network is the future of money or the greatest store of value — whatever you think it is that makes bitcoin important  it is made important because of the network’s energy use which is directly correlated to the computing power and sybil resistance of the networkthe bitcoin network doesn’t “waste” energy it consumes it we all recognize the value of burning thousands of tons of fuel to test rockets that may go to mars one day so why do we have a problem using energy to secure a truly decentralized global financial systemback in  satoshi understood this already when he wrote“it’s the same situation as gold and gold mining the marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold gold mining is a waste but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchangei think the case will be the same for bitcoin the utility of the exchanges made possible by bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used therefore not having bitcoin would be the net waste”also published on mediums subdomaintags
