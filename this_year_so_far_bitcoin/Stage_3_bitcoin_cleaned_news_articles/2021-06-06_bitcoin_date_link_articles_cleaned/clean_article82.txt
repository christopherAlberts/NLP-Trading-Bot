i think that the market is going to see a lot of noisy behavior but sooner or later we will get some type of impulsive candlestick to start followingbitcoin initially dropped during the trading session on friday dipping below the  ema however by the end of the session we have simply balanced just above it and now it looks as if the market is still in its “waitandsee” mode that it has been in for a whilehaving said that the fact that the market has gone sideways for a little while is relatively bullish at least in the sense that we stopped falling i do believe that this market is consolidating at the moment with the  ema acting as dynamic support the  level above continues to offer resistance as we have seen a couple of attempts to break above it and it is a large round psychologically significant figure if we were to break above that level then it would obviously be very bullish to the downside i believe that the  level is the bottom of the overall consolidation breaking down below that level would be extraordinarily negative and could open up the next leg lowerat this point it simply looks as if the market is trying to figure out what the next catalyst is and whether or not it is “safe” to start buying again in general i think that the market is going to see a lot of noisy behavior but sooner or later we will get some type of impulsive candlestick to start following i think the fact that the volume is dropping probably tells you that we are simply waiting i do not think that the market would be one that you should be jumping into with a lot of money or god forbid leverage but i do think that you have the ability to start accumulating if you are a longerterm “buyandhold trader” otherwise at best you are looking at a backandforth type of range bound market or perhaps may have to wait until we get the breakout or breakdownif we do get a breakdown below the  level we will go looking towards the  level rather quickly in fact i think at that point the market would probably become very bearish again for quite a while like we did several years ago that is not necessarily my base case scenario but it is a very real possibility
