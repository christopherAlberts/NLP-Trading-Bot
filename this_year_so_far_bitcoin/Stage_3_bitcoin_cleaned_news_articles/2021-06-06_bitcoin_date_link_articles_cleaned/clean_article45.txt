while writing the worlds most famous white paper satoshi nakamoto defined the bitcoin btc mining process it was established that the minting of new coins would take place through proofofwork to carry out this verification and to be able to mine the cryptocurrency computers would need to solve complex mathematical calculationsin the beginning there were not many miners however that changed before the first bitcoin bull run mining competition skyrocketed causing a sharp increase in the cost of machines capable of competing even more importantly energy demand exploded with the new machines — which needed energy mainly for processing and coolingafter eight years the energy demand for mining bitcoin has grown — and today has reached  terawatthours per year according to data from the cambridge bitcoin electricity consumption index or cbeci at first glance this seems like a lot right but lets take a closer look at the data to gain a better understanding of the real impact that bitcoin mining has on the environmentrelated ignore the headlines — bitcoin mining is already greener than you thinkthe use of energy in bitcoin miningsome influencers have recently appeared on social media and are associating bitcoin with an alleged increase in the use of fossil fuel energy especially coal in fact some countries — such as china — use coal as an important source of energy but is that the main fuel for the energy usedaccording to a study published by the university of cambridge in september“hydropower is listed as the number one source of energy with  of surveyed hashers indicating that their mining operations are powered by hydroelectric energy other types of clean energies eg wind and solar rank further down behind coal and natural gas which respectively account for  and  of respondents’ power sources”also according to the cbeci  twh of energy is produced in the world yearly only  twh is consumed meaning  is wasted bitcoin represents an energy expenditure of  of the total energy produced and only  of total electricity consumption worldwideanother survey recently released by galaxy digital compares bitcoins use of energy to the use of banks and gold mining according to the document the gold industry uses  twh per year while the banking system uses  twheven more alarming is what the cbeci points out regarding unused electronic devices in the united states alone with the electricity spent in one year by connected devices that are not in use it would be possible to feed the bitcoin network for almost two yearstherefore it is clear that bitcoins energy consumption is not as relevant as its said to be when compared with global energy production and waste not to mention that this consumption of roughly  twh is responsible for providing security and access to a dignified life for millions of people around the worldwhat we really should be aware of when talking about bitcoin being green is its carbon footprintrelated is bitcoin a waste of energy pros and cons of bitcoin miningbitcoins carbon footprintunfortunately much of the energy currently generated results in a high carbon rate and that should be the main concern and focal point when discussing bitcoins environmental impactaccording to data released in  by the scientific journal joule bitcoins carbon footprint is between  and  metric tons of  it is indeed a relevant amount that is comparable to jordan or sri lanka’s emission rates however it is considerably less for example than the energy expenditure by the american military force which according to data compiled by statista emits  mt fortunately there are simple ways to offset the carbon footprint left by bitcoin with the tokenization of assets some companies have chosen to tokenize carbon credits making it easier for miners and all those involved in some way with the cryptocurrency industry to lessen the impact caused by the generation of electrical energy used in mining machineslooking ahead our attention should be on the reduction of the use of fossil fuels with the aim to diminish the remaining carbon footprintit is worth noting that the environmental problem will not be solved only by reducing the use of fossil fuels it is even more important to optimize the use of the generated energy while focusing on reducing any waste and unnecessary carbon emissions in the processrelated the pandemic year ends with a tokenized carbon capandtrade solutiondeveloping a green bitcoinit is not expected that energy consumption by mining will increase a lot in the coming years as it is more associated with computing power than the adoption of bitcoin itself therefore the  twh should remain stable for some timeto achieve the goal of a green bitcoin network crypto mining companies can do their part by buying carbon credit tokens and pushing for production with less use of fossil fuels it is unfair — to say the least — to accuse bitcoin or miners of degrading the environment while turning a blind eye to the other  of the energy generatedbitcoin is open and can go to the ends of the earth regardless of limitations or prohibitions imposed by third parties it is important to remember that this cryptocurrency was created to provide a dignified life to ordinary and underprivileged individuals to prevent the depreciation of money to guarantee purchasing power and to improve
