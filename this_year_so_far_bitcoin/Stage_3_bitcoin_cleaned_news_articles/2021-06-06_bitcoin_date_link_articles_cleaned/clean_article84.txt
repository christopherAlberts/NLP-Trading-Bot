bitcoin and the altcoins are currently in a market rut the bullish recovery hasn’t been smooth sailing after the prices dropped at the end of may while the industry has had its fair share of positive changes and signs of reversals substantial results haven’t really panned out since the may  crashhigh tether reserves on exchanges have kept the bullish narrative somewhat alive however it might be time to incorporate another point of view to understand that things might not follow previous factors which were fundamentally bullish beforeis usdt going to pull bitcoin down and push ethereum and other altcoins upstablecoins have become an integral part of the industry over the past  years assets such as usdt usdc etc have injected more liquidity into space and have often acted as crypto reserves during choppy markets at the moment we are amid a choppy trading session and recovery has been expected to arrive when big usdt holders start buying back instablecoin supply ratio or ssr has been identified as a bullish bias for the market whenever the ssr ratio is low it is considered that the stablecoin supply has more “buying power” to purchase bitcoin hence driving the market up historically it has been observed back in the early half of however the landscape might have changed nowback in  only a few major assets such as bitcoin ethereum and litecoin had stablecoin pairs on exchanges the supply was still low and its movement was more reactive the market dynamics have completely changed now as most crypto assets have a usdt pairing on platforms hence it can be inferred that the ssr ratio cannot be considered as a ‘buying power’ for only btcthe introduction of defi further complicates matters as the desire for stablecoin yields became extremely popular demand increases for stable assets and now the industry is possibly at a point where usdt has less impact on bitcoin’s movementanalyzing changes with a grain of saltwith a growing number of investors institutions and interest the cryptocurrency market isn’t straightforward anymore let alone the factors determining a bullrun usdt and other stablecoins will continue to have a say on bitcoin altcoins movement but it is not as definitive as it was beforetether reserves on exchanges dropped recently as well but the impact on btc’s price hasn’t been outrightly positive the digital asset class is evolving and usdt is currently embedded with that narrative
