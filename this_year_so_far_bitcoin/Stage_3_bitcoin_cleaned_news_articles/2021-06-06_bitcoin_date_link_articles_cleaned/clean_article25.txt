for more than a century the stock market has proved time and again that its one of the greatest wealth creators on this planet if you buy stakes in great businesses and allow your investment thesis to play out over time history suggests you have a very good chance to build wealthbut in recent years investors have chosen to be mesmerized instead by the jawdropping returns of cryptocurrencies for instance a little over a decade ago a single bitcoin cryptobtc could have been purchased for around  as recently as this year that same token was going for nearly while its not uncommon for retail investors to chase momentum plays i believe theyre mistaken to do so  especially with cryptocurrencies thats because im a cardcarrying crypto skepticthe cryptocurrency space looks like a gigantic bubblewhy no love for digital currencies one of the bigger issues is their lack of realworld adoption and utility bitcoin the worlds largest digital currency has only been able to handle around  transactions on a daily basis for years comparatively the peoples currency dogecoin cryptodoge is only dealing with  transactions on its blockchain daily to put this into some context paymentprocessing giants visa and mastercard handled a combined  million daily transactions in  on an offexchange basis cryptocurrency is pardon the pun virtually uselessthe blockchain technology crypto is based on brings about another issue though blockchain offers new ways to immutably and transparently store and access data its run into one heck of a  no business is going to switch from proven infrastructure to something that hasnt been tested on a large scale in the realworld and no major businesses wants to be that guinea pig to demonstrate itll workand dont overlook the fact that some governments arent ok with crypto competing against their central bankbacked currencies a handful of countries have outright banned digital currencies altogether with china recently prohibiting banks and online payment businesses from offering services to the crypto industry china is the epicenter for bitcoin miningand of course misinformation and manipulation run rampant throughout the crypto space tesla ceo elon musk has whipsawed both bitcoin and dogecoin in recent months with a mixture of tweets and memes trust me this is a sentence i never thought id be writing with a straight face tesla initially bought  billion in bitcoin with musk allowing consumers to purchase electric vehicles with bitcoin but not long after musk ended the program by claiming that bitcoin mining wasnt ecofriendly hes since changed his perceived allegiance to dogecoin which may well be the biggest pumpanddump scheme in the crypto spaceand if this still isnt enough remember that every parabolic move in history has eventually burst and come back to earthsuffice it to say there are a lot of reasons i would strongly suggest avoiding cryptocurrenciesthese digital currencies could be longterm winnersnevertheless there are a very small number of cryptocurrencies i believe could be successful over time please note that could be successful is not my endorsement to buy i still firmly believe that crypto should be avoided however the following two digital currencies stand out as having the tools and differentiation to be longterm survivorsstellari view the crypto space as having two key focuses an aim to improve financial payments and a desire to tackle everything in the nonfinancial realm when it comes to financial payments the blockchain that i a crypto skeptic believe offers the most promise is stellar cryptoxlmcall me oldfashioned but i believe if a blockchain network is going to displace existing financial payment infrastructure it should be wildly more efficient as of today it can take up to a full week for payment made from one country to another to be validated and settled on stellars blockchain these same payments can be validated and settled across borders in a couple of seconds for a transaction fee that significantly undercuts many of its peers the more than  million stellar account holders are required to hold a small amount of lumens the stellar coin at all times to cover these nominal transaction fees in total stellar can make the roundtrip crossborder conversion of more than  fiat currencies to lumens and back to fiat faster than just about any other cryptocurrencywhats more stellar has claimed that it can handle up to  transactions per second even if this proves to be pieinthesky high and its a fraction of this efficiency it would still blow bitcoins transactions per second out of the waterstellar has support from ibm nyseibm as well even though ibms blockchain development buzz has waned in recent years it partnered with stellar back in  to create an international payment hub that would connect banks via stellars blockchainstellar is mostly off the radar for now but i view it as the paymentfocused network with the most longterm intrigueethereumon the other hand ultrapopular cryptocurrency ethereum cryptoeth offers the greatest potential outside of traditional financial applications even if it offers intrigue within the financial space too once again i remind you that this isnt an endorsement to buy ethereum here i believe the entire group is in a massive bubble thats already begun bursting but when taken as whole ethereum has a story and technology that longterm investors might be able to get behindone of the biggest lures for ethereum is its use of smart contracts these are protocols that help to verify facilitate and enforce the negotiation of a contract as an example a smart contract could help with the enforcement of a will if a deceased individual wanted to dictate that their grandchildren receive a certain amount of money when they reach a particular age a smart contract could handle the execution of these protocols best of all smart contracts are transparent immutable and legally bindinganother win for ethereum is the buzz its creating within the business community the enterprise ethereum alliance eea has more than  members some of which are brandname businesses the goal for these businesses is to promote the use of ethereums blockchain the eea is essentially the crypto spaces best bet to overcome the  of blockchain technologyethereum is also getting plenty of press for its role in decentralized finance or defi without getting overly technical defi is a financially focused blockchain that uses smart contracts to bypass financial intermediaries that might otherwise deny or slow a transaction while im not denying that ethereum will have a role in finance in the future ethereums differentiation can be seen clearest in the nonfinancial spacewhen the dust clears following an expected implosion in crypto valuations i believe ethereum and stellar will offer two of the most compelling ownership cases
