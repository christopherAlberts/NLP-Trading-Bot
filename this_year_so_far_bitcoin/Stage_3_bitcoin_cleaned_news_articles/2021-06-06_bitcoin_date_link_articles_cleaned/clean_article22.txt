ceo jack dorsey and microstrategy ceo michael saylor headlined the soldout bitcoin  miami conference on friday along with a starstudded lineup that included everyone from tony hawk to floyd mayweather jrin front of  attendees with thousands more watching online the two discussed why they are so bullish on bitcoin how they got started in the business their thoughts on recent esg concerns and much morehere are saylor and dorseys  best quotes from the interviews lightly edited and condensed for clarityjack dorseyfor me bitcoin changes absolutely everything what im drawn to most about it is the ethos what it represents the conditions that created it are so rare and so special and so precious and i dont think theres anything more important in my lifetime to work on i dont think theres anything more enabling for people around the world whatever i can do whatever my companies can do to make it more accessible to everyone is how i want to spend the rest of my life if i were not at square or twitter id be working on bitcoin if it needed more help than square and twitter i would leave them for bitcoin but i think both companies have a role to play theyre missing everything theyre not getting out of new york theyre not getting out of the country theyre not talking to people go to nigeria for one day and see the struggle that people have to put up with with their government and with their money go to ghana that has a bunch of transplants from all over the continent and you witness the same thing every single day go to india and youll see the same everything about it is why were into it theres nothing else that compares to it and we have no interests other than making sure we are building a native currency for the internet and helping in every way that we can so all the other coins to me dont factor in at all you just look at the economics of it and you know ultimately miners have to make a profit and getting cheap renewable energy maximizes their potential for profit its really that simple i thought i had some agreement with some notable figures out there and then that seemed to change in a matter of a few weeks…but i believe fully that bitcoin over time and today does incentivize more renewable energy…and gives people more freedom to convert unused wasted power into something that actually creates value for billions of people around the world that realization that we finally have a currency that can be traded at any single point on the planet is pretty incredible and what that enables going forward is pretty mindblowing and im going to do everything in my power to make sure that that happensmichael saylorwhen i discovered bitcoin i thought this is digital gold on a big tech monetary network and its going to grow by a factor of a hundred then i thought well i should buy as much as i cani was buying it and i was thinking i have to buy as much as i can as fast as i can or someone will figure this out and i wont be able to bitcoin is the apex property of the human race its the first time we figured out how to create true property that you can take possession of with full custodial rights thats least likely to be impaired thats most mobile…bitcoin is truly a seminal invention of the human race because for the first time in history we can grant property rights to  billion people i think bitcoin is an extraordinary disruptive beneficial technology to the whole energy industry as i studied it it became clear that its the highest value use of intermittent energy its the highest value use of renewable energy its the highest value use of wasted or stranded energy and its just the highest value use of energy period its the solution to developing power plants in remote locations to driving up efficiency of plants and driving down costs…i think as the world understands it theyre going to embrace it what i was doing with bitcoin was i was saying i dont want to decapitalize the company i want to keep the capital or grow the capital but i want to put an asset on the balance sheet the big breakthrough is i can convert my cash from a liability to an asset and then we realized that if that asset is going to go up by more than  a year and you can borrow money at  or four or three or two then you should pretty much borrow as much money as you can and flip it into the asset bitcoin links together  billion people links together a hundred million companies it synchronizes the world across political jurisdictions and it returns rationality to the entire financial system and it returns freedom and property rights to the entire human race we say bitcoin is hope bitcoin fixes everything…that certainly was the case with our stock…it imbued life into the company…morale was dramatically boosted we just had the best first quarter weve had in a decade
