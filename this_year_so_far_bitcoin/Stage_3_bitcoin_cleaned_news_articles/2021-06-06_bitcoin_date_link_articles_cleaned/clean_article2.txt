bitcoin’s strongest narrative is “digital gold” investors buy it not out of an expectation that it will behave like gold behaves in the market today but that it will some day take on the historic importance that gold has held across cultures and agesmy colleague george kaloudis recently reminded me that there’s one important aspect in which bitcoin will never be like gold in a vault or in the ground gold will always be gold bitcoin however is a technology and a technology will be updated this quality is now on display with the bitcoin network’s progress toward an update called taproot keep an eye out for george’s forthcoming indepth report on taproot at coindeskcomresearchtaproot is a bundle of several improvement proposals notable among them it would add data efficiencies that could ease supplyside pressure in bitcoin’s transactionfee market it also includes updates to multisignature transactions a bitcoin feature that is significant for custodians and other organizations that take direct custody of bitcoin in this column i’ll focus on the lattermultisignature addresses are a governance tool for organizations that directly custody bitcoin taproot includes updates designed to make multisigs easier to use and to improve their privacy a multisignature taproot transaction cannot be distinguished from other taproot transactions this could be significant for organizations that require multisignature transactions but do not wish to advertise to the network that they are using thembitcoin’s pseudonymity has made it a target for criticism that the network can be used for criminal purposes pseudonymity also provides security for legitimate operators on the internet nobody knows you’re a dog on bitcoin nobody knows you’re a financial institution for organizations using the bitcoin network privacy reduces the likelihood of cyberattackthis chart adapted for readability from txstatscom shows just how visible current multisig users are to the network it also raises a question with multisig growth at anemic levels is there really demand to justify adding these features we discussed that question on coindesk tv’s “all about bitcoin” show last weekmultisig’s shortcomings may be a barrier to adoption which taproot could address opening the door to increased use that could improve custodian services and make directcustody forms of investment more attractive or this could be a vaunted new feature that nobody will use remember microsoft setsmost technology investors understand the technology risk inherent in an update see samsung galaxy note  there’s also the adoption risk of developing a feature that nobody uses unlike ethereum bitcoin developers prefer backwardscompatible updates after taproot is implemented users will still be able to use pretaproot transactions this would be selfdefeating for taproot’s multisig privacy features pseudonymity only works in a crowdimproving multisigs also could make it easier to develop applications on top of bitcoin an especially relevant issue in  as decentralized finance nonfungible tokens and stablecoins have driven the cryptocurrency bull market at this writing the yeartodate returns on ether are roughly  times those of bitcoinat this point it seems likely that taproot will be enacted by the bitcoin network as more and more miners signal approval whether users take advantage of its features will be a telling test of bitcoin’s adaptability and by extension its viability as an updatable technology investmenton the other hand a perceived inability to update or adapt may strengthen bitcoin’s resemblance to gold – which after all does neither
