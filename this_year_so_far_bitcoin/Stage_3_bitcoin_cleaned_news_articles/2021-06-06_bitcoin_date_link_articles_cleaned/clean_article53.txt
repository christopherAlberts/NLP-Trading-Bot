square nysesq started out by creating a way for sellers to easily take credit card payments in person that has been a tremendous source of growth for the company but it struggled during the pandemic fortunately the company expanded beyond its original business enabling it to thrive over the past year its ecosystem now includes tools for sellers to list their products online and a cash app that has powered substantial growth over the past year on a fool live episode recorded on may  fool contributors brian stoffel and brian withers discuss the companys most recent results and how bitcoin helps the growth of its popular cash app and plays a role in the companys longterm successbrian withers moving on to square sq the bottom line for this quarter for square is its seller segment is rebounding and the cash app just continues to rock overall gross profit is up  year over year and sequentially i like to look at companies sequentially especially softwareasaservice companies or fintech like this one up  quarter over quarter just from  to  up  pretty impressivethe seller segment is rebounding well and has had the highest growth its had in the last five quarters hitting  million  for the quarter thats a  yearoveryear gain on the back of an  yearoveryear gain the previous quarter and up  sequentially the cash app amazing growth machine  year over year to  million  eclipsing the seller gross profit and up  quarter over quarterbitcoin revenue  billion more than a tenfold increase but the bitcoin is really what i would call a loss leader it only drove  million of gross profit even though it brought in  billion in revenue net income  million secondbest performance for the last five quarters continues to enhance its seller platform with inventory and messages its pointofsale for retail and restaurants continue to attract new sellers and sellers using these products in the retail and restaurant business contributed  million to gross profit dollars this quarter doubling year over yearseller gross profit in international markets grew nearly  but only  of sellers gross profit really excited about this company they didnt provide an outlook for  but said that they expect to invest  billion to  billion in operating expenses and distributing this investment across seller cash app as well as its tidal system tidal which was a recent acquisition which is around music and artists and enhancing the business systems for themstoffel if im a newbie at this and truth be told i dont follow square that much so i am a newbie at this ive heard a lot about how square is a play on bitcoin i have a followup question does that mean i can actually buy a bitcoin on squarewithers absolutelystoffel ok all rightwithers you actually buy it from squarestoffel so square buys the inventorywithers yeahstoffel ok all right is that a way to play bitcoin or like you said is that just a loss leader so just noisewithers i think its certainly a way to play the popularity of bitcoin users on the platform as i said they bought  billion worth of bitcoin last quarter in the last  days compared with  billion in all of  that only pulls in  million of gross profit this past quarter but more importantly i think it brings people to the cash appi love these landandexpand things once you are in the ecosystem and once youre in the cash app you can see how easy it is to transfer cash to people persontoperson or from their bank account and experience the other benefits i dont know if its necessarily a play on bitcoin and the increasing value of bitcoin but certainly the popularity of bitcoin
