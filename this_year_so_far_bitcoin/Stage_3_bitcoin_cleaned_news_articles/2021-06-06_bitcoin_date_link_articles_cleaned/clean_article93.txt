heres our summary of key economic events over the weekend that affect new zealand with news there is an historic deal to tax multinational companies properlybut first we should note that today is a public holiday in new zealandthe  has agreed to implement a global minimum rate that ensures multinationals pay tax of at least  in each country they operate as proposed by janet yellen and the biden administration now pressure on countries like ireland and other tax havens will grow intense to respect the deal in addition the  is rushing to set rules for digital currency issues partly to counter chinas lead in this areameanwhile china is moving to clean up and clear out bitcoin minersin addition the chinese central bank governor is backing a push for climate risk disclosure among chinese banks he did so after starting stress tests of financial sectorthe infant nutrition business in china isnt the pot of gold it was anymore and some international major players are exiting reckitt selling to a local investment companyon friday the indian central bank reviewed its policy positions and made no change india is in a tough covid fight and that is battering their economy as well as their health systems the central bank made no formal policy rate changes but it did turn dovish  the economic expansion they were expecting will now be a more subdued version in  their gdp forecast was trimmed from the recovering  to  and their inflation forecast was raised from  to  these seem heroic adjustments in the circumstances but local analysts suggest they are realisticsingapore has reported uninspiring retail data for april a clear sign normality is a way off for them yet but singapore still seems on track to achieve a  economic expansion despite recently going into another lockdown the industrial sectors driving their growth are not likely to be affected too much by the new restrictionsin australia home loan growth has been strong according to the latest data for april this is adding to the eyecatching trend that started in october and with the publishing of  gdp data we can now get a sense of the changing fortunes covid has brought to various nations economies australia is on the rise now larger than brazil and equal to russia which is falling behind but to keep things in perspective australia is still only about half the size of californias economy these comparisons reveal the fall in economic relevance of counties like russia autocratic countries might have seemed immune to some of the initial challenges of the pandemic but almost universally they have had stunted recoveries with future prospects uncertain it hasnt been easygoing anywhere but open and transparent economies have seemed to struggled through much betterin the us the widely anticipated may nonfarm payrolls report for the us has come in decidedly average with employment growing by  from april this comes after a surprisingly weak  rise in april from march in both months analysts had expected the gains to be very much higher at almost  mln in each month the net result is disappointment the participation rate is littlechanged job growth is bouncing along at a modest rate and may continue its uneven progress through their summer months that is the revised expectation nowstocks rose and benchmark bond yields fell as this suggests policy makers will need to retain easy money policies for longerthis hiring data is in contrast to the strong expansionary pmis we have been reporting earlier in the week both for factories and their service sector those other reports indicated healthy employment growthso how are the two reconciled firstly you should note that the reported payrolls are seasonally adjusted  and perhaps the historical basis for this isnt quite right now post pandemic a look at the actual data reveals a more upbeat situation in march nonfarm payrolls were actually  according to the unadjusted  table in april they rose to  in may they rose again to  that means in april payrolls actually rose by  in may they actually rose by  these are far far different changes than the seasonally adjusted numbers reported seasonal adjustment makes sense to get rid of the noise in monthonmonth data but when an economy is upended by a pandemic perhaps it creates its own new distortion time will tell  the seasonal adjustment process has been reliable though many economic crises over the years but the bald fact is american payrolls have actually risen by more than  mln in the past two months and in any assessment that is significant and a lot more than how most news outlets are reporting itbut then again perhaps some of those pmi reports were overdoing it the official april data on us factory orders has them slipping slightly down  from march looking through the pandemic base effect the april level is  lower than in april  so either way factory orders are weaker than you would expect in a recovering or recovered economy still this is april data and the pmi and payroll data is for may so we need to be careful about jumping to conclusionsin canada they also reported may payroll data and there was only disappointment there in april they had a large drop in payroll employment  unfortunately the may data follows this with another  fall their participation rate while higher than for the us fell their jobless rate is a high the ust  yield starts today still down at  the us  rate curve is still flatter at  bps their  curve is also marginally flatter at  bps while their  year curve is as well at  bps the australian govt ten year benchmark rate is  bp lower at  the china govt ten year bond remains at  and the new zealand govt ten year is holding at the price of gold starts today at  and unchangedoil prices start today littlechanged at just under  in the us while the international brent price are just under the kiwi dollar opens today marginally firmer at  usc but trading will be very light against the australian dollar we have firmed slightly to  auc but against the euro we are at  euro cents that means our  starts today at the bitcoin price is now at  and another  lower than this time saturday in china under pressure from beijing social media platform weibo has blocked the accounts of some large crypto trading companies volatility in the past  hours has been moderate at  the easiest place to stay up with event risk today is by following our economic calendar here Â»
