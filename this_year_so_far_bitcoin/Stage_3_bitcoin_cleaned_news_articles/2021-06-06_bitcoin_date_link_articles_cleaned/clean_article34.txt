bitcoin btc is facing difficulty breaching the  mark again after briefly crossing it on may  the cryptocurrency is currently exchanging hands at around the  mark which is a  drop from its alltime high of  on april  among others a key difference between macroeconomic conditions affecting the cryptocurrency market as a whole is institutional demandone of the key investment vehicles for set demand is the grayscale bitcoin trust gbtc a btc trust of grayscale investments one of the most significant investment managers for institutions indulging in digital currencies the trust allows investors to have exposure to the price of bitcoin through a regulated traditional investment vehicle without having to buy store and safekeep their token directlygbtc trades publicly on the otcqx an overthecounter marketplace that enables stock trading gbtc currently trades in the  range  down from its alltime high of  on feb each share represents  btc with the share tracking bitcoin’s market price excluding the applicable fees and expenses it has a minimum holding period of six months and a minimum investment requirement of  entailing that it is not ideally suited for retail investorsgrayscale btc premium negative for over three monthsdue to implications of institutional demand that backs grayscale and the fact it’s a regulated way of gaining exposure to bitcoin its products usually trade at a premium to the net asset value nav or the current value of the holdings the gbtc premium refers to the difference between the value of the assets held by the trust against the market price of those holdingsbefore feb  of this year this difference was always a positive number indicating a premium that hit its alltime high of  four years ago on june   since the end of february this year the premium has turned into a discount reaching an alltime low of  on may since this difference is driven by supply and demand factors in the market a rising gbtc premium shows a higher inflow of bitcoin into the trust while a decreasing premium transitioning into a discount indicates a declining btc inflow entailing that gbtc trades at a discount to spot price of bitcoincointelegraph discussed the implications of the change of the gbtc premium trend with nikita ovchinnik chief business development officer of  network — a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange ovchinnik said “it looks like gbtc premium is a very good indicator of mediumterm market sentiment the premium turned negative at the end of april and while the digital assets experienced a local boom lack of institutional interest predicted may’s market cap shrinkage”this trend is consistent with the number of bitcoin the grayscale trust has in its holdings as it has been increasing gradually since jan  to reach its alltime high of  tokens on march  since then its bitcoin reserves have been on the gradual decline for the first time ever to the current levels of  as of june  the trust currently has an aum of  billionthe premium allows investors to leverage this opportunity through arbitrage opportunities one way is for investors to borrow bitcoin and use it as an exchange for gbtc shares once the sixmonth lockup period ends investors can sell the shares in the secondary market at the prevailing premiumwith the funds they receive in this exchange they purchase and give back the borrowed btc tokens to the lender in this process investors pocket the difference in price created due to the premium thus successfully executing their arbitrage ovchinnik further opined“gbtc is one of the most convenient and secure points of entry for institutional funds it looks like their demand was one of the drivers early in  but it slowed down and we no longer hear new entities claiming that they have decided to diversify and are trying to hold blockchain assets”in the traditional financial markets the gbtc premiumdiscount can be compared to the pricing of closedend mutual funds ideally since the amount of bitcoin by the trust is publicly disclosed the value of the trust should amount up to exactly that value due to the aforementioned premiumdiscount factors the value is not the samebryan routledge associate professor of finance at carnegie mellon university’s tepper school of business told cointelegraph that the “premium reflected its position as a ‘regulated’ alternative to owning bitcoin” thus “an investor would pay a premium for the access via a trust” routledge also added that the gbtc premium shouldn’t be perceived as an additional cost“if you buy and sell and the premium is the same the impact is minimal recently there are more easy and comfortable ways to access bitcoin so the premium in grayscale has fallen it is now at a discount relative to bitcoin nav”despite gbtc trading as a discount in relation to nav there have been a few positive signs in the recent trend the gbtc discount rebounded sharply between may  and may  from  to  before falling to around  as of june  this indicates that institutional interest is rising in tandem with reducing bitcoin prices between these daysthe direction in which the gbtc premiumdiscount moves could work as an indicator of market sentiment in the asset especially among institutional investorsbitcoin etfs a close competitor to gbtcin addition to gbtc another route for institutional and retail investors alike to gain exposure to bitcoin’s price volatility through a regulated channel is bitcoin exchangetraded fundspurpose investments launched north america’s firstever bitcoin etf on feb  which saw the assets under management aum rise to over  million in under a week and subsequently crossed  billion in the same month the etf’s aum currently stands at  million or  bitcoin as of june  and uses the ticker btccin addition to purpose’s btc etf evolve etfs launched its own bitcoin etf on feb  with the ticker ebit although it lost out on the firstmover advantage that purpose’s etf gained it currently has assets under management of  million which is just over  of btcc’s current aum overall there are several notable etfs listed on the toronto stock exchangerelated carbonneutral bitcoin funds gain traction as investors seek greener cryptowhat’s interesting to note about these etfs is that the timing of their launch coincides with a decrease in the gbtc premium which eventually turned into a discount routledge mentioned why this could be the case “etfs are a cheaper transaction costs fees way to bitcoin exposure so the premium on grayscale has fallen — reflecting good oldfashioned competition”the gbtc trust has a management fee of  while the purpose btc etf has a management fee of  and the evolve etf fee is even less at  due to the success of the existing canadian etfs the lure of the etf market is such that even grayscale has confirmed that it will be turning its products into etfs insteadbut before that they would need the much elusive approval from the united states securities and exchange commission that several firms have already applied for including fidelity and skybridge for ovchinnik the existence of these new products is “very important over the longterm horizon even though we might not see changes instantly”related for the long haul when bitcoin nosedived institutions held fastthe competition for the btc etf market share is set to heat up if the us sec approves any of the several crypto etf applications it has received until that point gbtc remains among the top indicators of institutional interest with etfs following at its heels and fighting for the same market participantsfurthermore as the gbtc remains closed for new investments until september this year drastic changes to the current gbtc discount are not expected but a spell of positive trends as noticed between may  and may  could bring good news for the lack of institutional demand felt in the market
