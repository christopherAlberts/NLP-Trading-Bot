after  years truce nears in useurope jet subsidy warparis the united states and europe are expected to announce a fiveyear suspension of tariffs in their  dispute over aircraft subsidies on tuesday allowing them to focus on the threat posed by china’s nascent commercial aircraft industry people familiar with the matter saida deal to pause the world’s largest corporate trade dispute would help us planemaker boeing and europe’s airbus  while granting relief to dozens of other industries affected by titfortat tariffs that were suspended in march they face a renewed trade war within weeks if there is no progressus trade representative katherine tai discussed the dispute in her first facetoface meeting with eu counterpart valdis dombrovskis on monday ahead of tuesday’s useu summit where china will also be a key topic tai travels to britain on wednesdaythe european commission which oversees eu trade policy and the united states had vowed to find a solution by july  when the currently suspended transatlantic tariffs are due to resumeofficials had targeted a permanent solution through a pair of treaties — one between the united states and european union the original parties and another between washington and london following britain’s exit from the eu — on new ground rules for aerospacebut reaching a detailed accord has proven complex given nearly two decades of legal wrangling and thousands of pages of documents said one source briefed on the talksa standstill agreement would push back the resumption of tariffs by years at a time when us president joe biden has vowed to reset relations with european partners after four tumultuous years under former president donald trumpfreezing the conflict over jet subsides some of which have been rescinded or wound down would give both sides more time to focus on broader agendas such as concerns over china’s statedriven economic model several of the sources saidthe tariffs on  billion of goods were progressively imposed from  after the united states and eu both won partial victories at the world trade organization over claims of unfair aid for boeing and airbusthe dispute has dragged on since  when the united states withdrew from a  aircraft subsidy pact and took the eu to the wto claiming airbus had managed to equal boeing’s share of the jet market thanks in part to subsidized government loansthe eu countersued over what it termed unfair rd support and subsidized tax incentives for boeingin recent months top european british and us officials have engaged in intense discussions to settle the dispute and focus on other challenges including chinatai told reuters in may she was optimistic about reaching a deal with brussels adding that the two sides needed to look at “the bigger question” of china’s ambitions to become a global player in the commercial aircraft industrythe us has floated a joint review of aerospace funding in nonmarket economies like china two of the people saidone of the sources said the two sides had agreed to increase informationsharing but gave no further details“there’s no question that the rise of china’s aircraft industry is  on everybody’s proverbial radar” us chamber of commerce senior vice president marjorie chorlins told reporters on monday noting what she described as china’s “heavy subsidization” of its industriesshe said settling the dispute would provide “a tremendous boost of goodwill” for broader useuropean tiesbrussels and washington remain at odds over steel and aluminum tariffs but are expected at tuesday’s summit to set a dec  deadline to end punitive tariffs related to the dispute according to a draft communique seen by reuterslike the united states the eu has sparred with beijing on trade and security this year but its  nations could struggle to agree a common front on topics like aerospacein april for example hungary blocked an eu statement criticizing china’s new hong kong security law sparking a row over the right of member states to veto eu foreign policythe chinese embassy in washington had no immediate commentnone of the parties agreed to comment on the talksin a potentially key breakthrough the united states had watered down opposition to the principle of future public loans for airbus and removed its demand for compensationbut its insistence on advance notice of any future public loans had triggered concerns among eu officials who rejected giving washington any veto power people familiar with the talks saideven more critical is the benchmark to be used when deciding whether the interest on any future loans is marketcompatibleunder the  subsidy pact one third of a project could be financed by direct government support such as loans and cleared indirect rd support up to  percent of a company’s revenueone option is to revisit that framework with market rules replacing subsidy quotas and a new cap on indirect rd supportbrexit has also complicated negotiationsbritain and the united states came close to striking an aerospace agreement in december that could have forced the hand of brussels in its own talks with washingtonbritain’s ability to negotiate trade deals independently of the eu is central to its new “global britain” stance but its flexibility on airbus is cramped by its role as one of four core nations involved in the planemaker predating its eu accessionairbus which has  staff in britain has made plain work could shift abroad if the uk turns its back on aerospace
