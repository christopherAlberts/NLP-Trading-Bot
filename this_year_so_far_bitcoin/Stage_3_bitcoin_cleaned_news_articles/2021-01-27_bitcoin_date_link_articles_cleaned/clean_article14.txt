a luxury online wine retailer has enjoyed a surge in demand after the value of bitcoin increased by around  between march  and january lasserre  papillon a negociant based in bordeaux set up btc wine when bitcoin enjoyed a remarkable bull run during  the world’s most popular cryptocurrency increased from  to an alltime high of  that yearconditions naturally became ripe for a reversal and the bitcoin mania subsided as its value dropped below  by march  yet the btc wine team was undeterred and it continued to fine tune its offering confident that another bull run would soon take offbtc wine sells highend wines by the case to consumers around the world and they pay using bitcoin ethereum or bitcoin cash its current bestsellers are cheval blanc  canon la gaffelière  sassicaia  louis roederer cristal  latour  and pavie bitcoin was worth around  by march  but it lost half of its value in a twoday plunge after the world health organization declared  to be a pandemic yet savvy investors sensed an opportunity after it crashed below the  mark they started snapping up btc at discounted prices and then a bitcoin halving took place in mayfor the uninitiated a halving takes place once every four years and it cuts the reward for mining new blocks in half that reduces the number of new bitcoins being generated by the network making the existing supply more value in theory it should push prices up if demand remains strongbitcoin took off again by middecember it had broken the previous alltime high set in  and it went past the  mark for the first time in january  since then it has generally been hovering between  and  many people that bought at the bottom began selling their bitcoins and leading the high life at a time when most people are strapped for cashbtc wine was therefore uniquely placed to thrive at a time when the majority of the french wine trade was in disarray“it’s going very well because of the bull run” says sales director louis de bonnecaze “we have a new kind of customers they have a lot of bitcoin and they want to spend it fine wine is a status symbol they have bought the cars and the real estate and then they go directly to the fine wine so it’s a good market for us“the wine market is not doing very well because we are experiencing covid brexit the tax in the us for us cryptocurrency payments has been a way to make some business in this very difficult period the cryptosphere is a fascinating topic for us it is above all a way to open our fine wine business to new tech wealthy customers blockchain technology opens new perspectives regarding traceability and logistics we are thinking about exploring these perspectives“we find synergies between wine and cryptocurrency because wine in a way is a tangible asset and bitcoin is another asset it was natural for us to mix the two businesses”btc wine has three different meanings btc is the abbreviation of bitcoin like usd eur gbp and so on it also means business to consumer and by the case many of btc wine’s customers are younger than your average fine wine buyer but de bonnecaze says the firm has received interest from a pretty broad range of clients“the main core of customers are in their  and  but you have some people who are in their  or ” he says “recently we had a guy whose son gave him one bitcoin a few years ago  and he wanted to spend it he didn’t know anything about it so we helped him to spend it with his wallet”the team has found that sales perform well during bullish market conditions but they decrease during bearish conditions when asked how he thinks bitcoin will fare in the years ahead de bonnecaze says “my friends know i am dealing with bitcoin and they contact me to ask my predictions i am pretty sure that bitcoin and blockchain and the cryptocurrency market will grow in a very huge way in the longterm but of course if you enter now you will lose money because i am pretty sure there will be another decrease in the longterm i think it will be very useful”the current range features around  wines spanning bordeaux grands crus top burgundy wines rhône valley fine wines luxury champagne super tuscans and highend spanish wines yet the team is in the process of increasing the range to  “we are looking for the best wines in every country we have bought the best wines from england – the most expensive sparkling wine that chapel down has about £ a bottle we only want luxury wines we don’t want to sell by the bottle or cheap wines that’s not our business “the fine wines are packed in original wooden cases and shipped around the world with full insurance and safety overpackagingit has also created a limited edition called bitcoin la cuvée which is available in margaux and saintemilion grand cru packed in original wooden case of six bottles numbered from  to  with the option of purchasing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrenciesaccepting bitcoin as a banking method presents challenges and opportunities for a wine merchant the advantage of bitcoin ether and bitcoin cash is that they are decentralized peertopeer currencies they allow direct transfers from one wallet to another crossing international borders with ease and cutting out the need for a middleman banks and traditional financial institutions do not get involved so there is no need for handling fees conversion fees and so on that makes it a lot cheaper to deal in crypto than in fiat currencies like euros and dollarsit is also a lot quicker a traditional bank transfer can take several business days to arrive whereas bitcoin arrives in around  minutes ether and bitcoin cash are even quicker as these altcoins have shorter block times these transactions are also very secure as only the sender and recipient have the keysthe main challenge is the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin bitcoin cash and ether they can lose  of their value in a day but merchants can mitigate this by using a platform like bitpay“we use bitpay for processing payments and it’s very easy to use” says de bonnecaze “i even recommend my competitors to use it if a customer sends us  btc to buy a case of petrus we can decide to transfer automatically   or we can keep a certain amount in bitcoin we could take  in normal currency in our bank account and keep  in btc to bet on the crypto market ”trading in bitcoin actually helps protect an international business btc wine against forex fluctuations because it arrives so quickly and can instantly be converted to euros via bitpaya few other merchants have followed suit and started to accept btc and de bonnecaze welcomes as much competition as possible in this space “if we have a lot of competitors it will help the market grow bigger we would like bitcoin to be a money and if it is to be a money it needs to be exchanged which is why i am welcoming other people to do the same even our competitors we need all the actors in our business and other businesses to use it we need mass adoption“i fully recommend it because it will bring new customers to you some people are a little bit scared because they have heard about it being money from money laundering terrorism the dark web and stuff like that but i explain that the dark web was not waiting for bitcoin to be effective and there are a lot of money laundering transactions with dollars and other currencies so it’s not new”lasserre  papillon is one of the younger negociants in bordeaux so it is happy to take risks push boundaries and blaze trails it hopes to see companies within the trade exploring crypto“we would like to pay our suppliers in bitcoin but we will have to wait a little bit to pay cheval blanc or margaux with bitcoin” says de bonnecaze
