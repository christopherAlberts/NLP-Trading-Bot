reserve bank of india worried moneycontrol’s twopart series demystifies bitcoin and how they work today’s story talks about bitcoin as an investment optionin  delhibased rahul mishra  invested in the bitcoin after seeing his office colleagues do so and like many others he understood precious little of this new animal back then the bitcoin’s price had already surged to rs  lakh up from rs  at the start of that year every month he kept investing rs  he had diverted his ongoing mutual fund systematic investment plans to the bitcoinjust six months later he got a rude shock the reserve bank of india rbi issued a circular banning cryptocurrency trading in india it directed all legal entities regulated by the rbi to not deal in virtual currencies or provide services to any individuals or businesses dealing in cryptocurrencies investors panicked bitcoin’s price in india crashed in a matter of seven days its price fell from a high of rs  lakh per bitcoin to rs  lakh his own investment in bitcoin worth rs  lakh before the ban fell to rs also read explained  rbi’s proposed cryptocurrency project and what it means for youthe meteoric rise of bitcoinone main reason behind the surge of the bitcoin was the supreme court’s ruling that came last year already bitcoin is legal in the us and uk “most central banks have managed to tide over the  pandemic situation by injecting excess liquidity into the system so part of it is getting invested in bitcoins” says ashvin parekh managing partner at ashvin parekh advisory services llp beyond the sc relief order there has been no news from the government’s side on the legality of the bitcoin for instance you cannot use bitcoins in india to buy goods and services you can however buy and sell bitcoins itself now but the sheer hope of bitcoin being acceptable as a currency causes the price to increasethe other reason is that some large institutions have begun to back bitcoin paypal a usbased online wallets firm now allows its users to buy and sell bitcoins it also allows its customers to buy items from its network of  million sellers by paying in bitcoins “institutional support from payment giants such as paypal and mastercard integrating cryptocurrencies into their services among others have been major drivers of prices the earlier scepticism has now given way to widespread acceptance” says sumit gupta cofounder and ceo of coindcx“basic economics suggests that efficient markets discover price based on demand and supply given that the only  new bitcoins are minted every day at present the interest from new buyers is increasing demand disproportionately naturally the price is increasing and will increase as long as this imbalance of demandsupply exists” says ajeet khurana a cryptocurrency expert and founder of genezis networkhow legal is bitcoin really in indiaafter the sc’s judgement last year a few crypto exchanges claimed that some public and private banks now allow customers to link their bank accounts for trading in cryptocurrency moneycontrol reached out to state bank of india icici bank kotak mahindra bank axis bank idfc first bank canara bank and federal bank none of them responded“at present there is no law that either ratifies or prohibits trading in bitcoin and other cryptos we do not encourage our customers to invest in any cryptos by linking the bank accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges” says a retail banker requesting anonymitythe challenge is about bitcoin being recognised as a currency in a tightlyregulated currency market till that happens bitcoin will mostly likely be recognised only as an investment optiondue to lack of clarity bitcoin is treated as an asset much like gold or real estate under the incometax laws tax experts classify bitcoin as ‘income from other assets’ if you sell it after three years you pay  percent longterm capital gains tax with indexation benefits shortterm gains are taxed at your personal slabthe flipside of anonymitybitcoin’s anonymity can also work against you transactions once done cannot be reversed since bitcoin is not regulated there is no grievance settlement mechanism all bitcoin transactions are irreversible but most importantly you’ve got to remember the password to your bitcoin wallet if you forget your bitcoin password there is no way to recover it your bitcoin value is lost forever here’s how it worksall bitcoin owners get a public key due to its democratic and anonymous nature bitcoin buyers and sellers don’t get to know each other’s identity you are instead assigned a public key that is your public identity that you use to receive the bitcoin conversely if you wish to send a bitcoin to someone you need the receiver’s public key think of it like a username “to access your bitcoin however you need to remember a private key think of it as your password but the keys are a set of alphanumeric characters if you lose your keys you lose your bitcoin forever” says nischal shetty founder  ceo of wazirx crytpcurrency exchangeshould you invest in bitcoinretail investors must avoid bitcoin mrin agarwal financial educator and founder of finsafe india equates investing in bitcoin to gambling she adds “there is no underlying asset it’s unregulated price discovery is unpredictable stay away”“investing in any asset without understanding it is akin to gambling first time investors should spend time and effort understanding more about bitcoin before investing if they choose to invest they should put in small amounts as low as rs  to try it out and if they intend to invest significant amounts they should use averaging strategies as no one can time the market” suggested ajeet khurananobody knows when the bitcoin would become a globallyacceptable currency “you shouldn’t bet your entire savings on bitcoin just because of its past returns the bitcoin is meant only for those who can take high volatility and losses” says mukul shrivastava partner forensic and integrity services ey
