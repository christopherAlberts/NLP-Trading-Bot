bitcoin enjoyed a historic price rise in  and into  but what could the rest of the year bring for btcthe bitcoin price has surged about  percent over the last  months thanks to mainstream adoption and institutional interest it has rallied massively to surpassing alltime highs of  at the time of this writing the price is hovering around  and it will be interesting to watch traders’ reactions and price behavior for the rest of the bull run will likely continuebitcoin’s bull cycle will likely continue especially in the second half of  one of the causes of price increase will be widespread adoption currently relatively few people accept and use bitcoin in everyday life however we could see mainstream acceptance in the coming months for instance paypal has allowed its users to buy and sell bitcoin using paypal accounts also square invested  million in bitcoin ongoing mainstream adoption like this could boost bitcoin’s price significantlythe liquidity in bitcoin has been a telltale sign that more institutional bodies are at play similarly throughout  the institutional interest is expected to drive the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrenciesin another sign of the mainstream growth of cryptocurrencies expected in  major cryptocurrency exchange coinbase is expected to become a publiclylisted company this year the exchange’s institutional assets increased from  billion to a whopping  billion between april and november of caused by the us dollar’s cyclical bear market and global liquidity bitcoin will benefit significantly from people hedging against inflation many retail traders will also jump in due to the fear of missing out fomo pushing the price further traders who will not want to invest directly in bitcoin will trade contracts for difference cfds on bitcoin via forex brokers and trading platformsinstitutional interestas mentioned above in october  paypal announced that it would support buying and selling cryptocurrency also other institutions and wall street giants have shown interest in cryptocurrency for instance jpmorgan chase  co and citibank are predicting a bullish bitcoin market according to a leaked report from citibank the analysts refer to bitcoin as  century gold predicting that it could hit  by the end of  likewise will woo a former partner at adaptive capital has referred to  as a conservative pricea note to institutional clients from tom fitzpatrick the global head of citifx leaked on twitter the note showed a chart of three bitcoin bulls in the last decade he suggested that the bitcoin rally could hit a peak of  in december  however other analysts such as btig and bloomberg have been more conservative predicting the price will reach fiat fiscal and monetary policiesfiscal policy and monetary policies aiming to devalue currency will work in favor of the bitcoin price much of the demand will come from investors who fear that the money printing will devalue conventional money with fiat money growing out of control bitcoin is seen as a fixed asset just like goldbesides a weak monetary policy the dollar could also be affected massively by the  vaccine rollout for these reasons the demand for bitcoin might increase significantlypullback could happenwhile cryptocurrency proponents are exuberant there is a possibility that bitcoin prices won’t rise beyond the alltime high set in  in fact the price may fall back and remain below this mark for some time as was the case during the  rally some believe that the only time bitcoin is likely to reach another significant high is in  following the next mining subsidy halvingbitcoins popularity as digital gold is spreading fast however unlike gold bitcoin is experiencing its first global crisis caused by  as it was born in  following the  financial recession the  bear run in the market saw investors sell equities for cash even gold which is considered by many to be a safer investment than bitcoin dipped in march bitcoin crashed hard in midmarch too but the bitcoin case was different the cryptocurrency bounced from the bottom a month later in a bull run that continued until the end of the yearregulatorsregulators have been scrutinizing digital currencies for years some people albeit only a few are using cryptocurrencies to engage in illegal trades and with the surging value of cryptocurrencies governments around the world will be looking closely at the market for instance a lawsuit by the us securities and exchange commission sec against altcoin project ripple saw xrp prices fall by almost halfregulatory agencies could suddenly erect a hurdle to tame unscrupulous activities surrounding bitcoin but this regulation couldn’t affect bitcoin’s bullish run significantlycompetition from central banks and big techtransactions involving different fiat currencies can take days and involve heavy fees and a global digital currency could significantly streamline this process in  while bitcoin adoption is growing the cryptocurrency could face competition to solve this problem from big tech a good example is facebook’s digital currency and while facebook diem is quite different from bitcoin it may draw some attention away from bitcoin in likewise central banks are also competing against bitcoin as reported by banks for international settlements  percent of central banks are on the verge of developing some form of digital currency for instance china is working toward the adoption of a digital yuan in many critical ways these central bank digital currencies will be vastly different than bitcoinconclusionin general the adaptation of bitcoin in commerce is a perfect cause for price increases in  while bitcoin’s price and adoption is expected to proliferate we can’t rule out the opposite and volatility is certainly possiblethis is a guest post by michael opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of btc inc or bitcoin magazine
