we’re focusing on a threeyearold cyber theft case where close to  million went missing at dooga — this is a ukbased crypto exchange now that theft led to the exchange’s bankruptcy the stolen crypto traced to two accounts held in the us and now returned to its rightful owner the now bankrupt firm’s liquidator trying to get those funds back in this month january  a us federal bankruptcy judge ordered that the digital assets held in those two accounts at two usbased exchanges be returned to those us liquidatorswell joining me today is the legal representative of dooga the man who helped track down the lost digital assets — one of the leading minds in the legalities surrounding blockchain and crypto and some forensic skills to boot — kobre  kim partner ben sauterben welcome back to the showbenjamin sauter thank you it’s great to be back i appreciate itlau now one always assumed that once it got hacked once you lose it you can’t get it back walk us through this case how were you forensically able to trace these funds to the perpetratorssauter the idea that lost bitcoin is lost for good is a common misperception and depending on how it’s taken and where it’s sent you actually have some different ways and different remedies to get it back it could depend on the particular circumstances but in this particular case and other matters i’ve been involved in you’d be surprised how often you’re actually able to trace bitcoin through forensic techniques to exchanges and other points of intersection where kyc is conducted where assets are exchanged for other types of assets and when that happens there actually are opportunities and increasingly wellaccepted ways to get assets backlau not to give up any kind of proprietary forensic investigative tools that you have but a lot of people would just assume that this is blockchain this is anonymous and that’s the whole point how are you able to trace the series of numbers and letters around cyberspacesauter well maybe an example would be helpful an example i can share is at a high level what happened in the cubits matterso cubits was an exchange like others that the audience may be familiar with coinbase etclau so cubits is dooga the uk exchange we’re talking about heresauter yes it used to do business as cubits cubits was an actual exchange after the fraud in question it went out of business and became known as dooga but at the time and some viewers may be familiar with it that it was doing business as cubits and one thing is common for exchanges like this to do particularly when they’re working in certain asian jurisdictions as to work with payment processors who actually take in funds from customers and have a contractual relationship with the exchange so in this particular fraud cubits opened accounts for  who turned out to be the wrongdoers those wrongdoers purchased bitcoin through cubits and then tried to withdraw and cubits was told by its payment processor — who turned out to be part of the fraud — that it had received funds as one end of this transaction so the exchange allowed the bitcoin to leave its wallet to the account holdersthe problem is it never got the other end of that transaction never got paid for the bitcoin that it allowed to leave so it was out — as you mentioned at the intro —  million dollars which caused the exchange to go out of business — this was in early  what we were able to do when we were engaged was really two things one we knew — because we’d conducted some kyc ourselves — who the wrongdoers were which allowed us to pursue a strategy of government enforcement and government contact and local jurisdictionsbut because we had sent the bitcoin from our own addresses we were able to see on the blockchain the addresses that received those funds so some people who are sophisticated at conducting frauds will run bitcoin through mixers and tumblers and ways to conceal and obfuscate the nature of those transactions and some of that happened here and we were actually able to link the proceeds of this fraud to some wellknown money laundering ringsbut the state of forensics and blockchain right now is getting so good that you can actually see through quite a bit of that and we were able to see through and trace from one wallet to the next where those transactions went and what happens is when those wallets send to a known exchange that will appear in a commonly used forensic software so we were able to see transfer after transfereventually the assets hit some exchanges in the united states and also exchanges elsewhere in the world that we’ve been able to identify and once you see funds land at an exchange you have a degree of hope that the exchanges did their job and kept kyc and also that they can freeze those accounts and can and often do respond to court orders directing them to freeze and ultimately turn over those assets and that’s exactly what we did and what happened in the dooga caselau and that’s exactly what happened as you said the us federal bankruptcy judge ordered that these assets that you were able to trace back to those us exchanges be returned to the rightful owner dooga now this sets some pretty interesting precedents it essentially allows — in the united states — a judge has essentially set a new precedent that is able for somebody who’s been victimized to retrieve your own stolen fundssauter that’s right i’ve actually been involved in a few different cases — to my knowledge were first of their kind — availing themselves of different procedures to get to that type of orderwhat was interesting about the dooga matter is it was a legal procedure seeking to recognize a foreign bankruptcy so when dooga went out of business it went out of business in the uk which is where it was based but there is a procedure to recognize that bankruptcy in the united states once you do that you can consolidate all of the other people who may be holding assets into one proceeding so it becomes a very efficient way to resolve ownership rights in assets that you can identify in the united states essentially any exchange  its holding asset that we could connect to that fraud becomes an asset of the estate and once you can call an asset an asset at that estate the bankruptcy court can issue an order awarding property rights effectively over that asset and that results in exchanges transferring those assets to usso this particular matter had the benefit of there being a foreign bankruptcy proceeding that we could incorporate into the united states i think that was the first time to my knowledge that particular technique had been done to successfully recover assets from the united states but i’ve also pursued similar orders other ways by filing what’s called john doe lawsuits where you get subpoena power and eventually court orders that can issue orders as to assets that may be held by exchanges as well even if you don’t have a bankruptcy proceeding to piggyback off of so there are some different ways to get the same resultlau so this is actually really interesting for a lot of people who still have the impression that it’s anonymous you can’t track it down that it’s untraceable and it really also runs counter to a lot of even high level regulators who say that there’s a level of opaqueness that criminals can hide behind when in fact forensically it has been very clear  it’s elevated to the point where you can actually see where this money or these assets are going right down to the fifth or sixth layer of the next exchange it runs counter to so many of these impressions what’s the reality of how traceable cryptocurrency actually issauter the reality is somewhere in between from one transaction to the next you may not know who is behind a particular wallet address and if digital assets are sent to cold storage wallets you’ll be able to see that transfer on the blockchain or most blockchains but you won’t necessarily know who is behind or who controls those wallets the way you get that information is by tracing it from wallet to wallet until it hits a known entity or a known person and there are lots of lists and there are companies that sell proprietary software that will tell you who is behind known wallets or clusters of wallets and so if those transfers you don’t necessarily know but if you do see that it hits in exchange then at that point you have the ability to get any information that exchange has about who controls that wallet so if the exchanges are doing their job and conducting kyc and have accurate kyc about their account holders then you can learn the identity of that person who controls that wallet from the exchange or from other businesses that operate in this spacelau it’s kind of like aml antimoney laundering techniques where you’re looking for that big windfall or that big withdrawal and that’s a huge clue that connects back to ‘okay when was this’ if you watch any hollywood film on bank robbers you can see that you don’t want to spend  proceeds of your crime all in one time and you certainly want to escape to the jurisdiction where it’s a little bit more opaque so that’s essentially harder to do when everything can be digitally traced what does this mean for all of those future victims that fall to cybercrimedoes this mean that in fact there are actually techniques and strategies to get you whole againsauter in a lot of ways this makes it easier not harder easier for victims of fraud to figure out who the perpetrators are and ultimately recover their funds in traditional asset recovery matters you serve subpoenas to a bank then you learn who was at that bank you take another month and you send a subpoena to another bank and you unwind a series of transactions to a series of subpoenas that often take you overseas just that process of learning who’s behind one transfer to the next can take months if not more whereas the blockchain you can see all of that in realtime and issue one subpoena to the endpoint in the chain the exchange that received the funds so there is a very very real sensethe process of tracing the money to a known entity can be quite a bit easier in blockchain and the linchpin is that somebody out there is collecting knowyourcustomer kyc information which is why the bank secrecy act and kyc requirements have been taken very seriously by governments around the world and increasingly in the united states because that kyc is what enables governments and victims of fraud to be able to use the blockchain but actually connect it to the real worldlau what other developments can we expect from this case that has a wider impact on the entire crypto industry in your viewsauter well i think it is a great reminder to the industry of creative options that are available to you to identify perpetrators of fraud to hold them to account and ultimately recover assets and i have seen personally an uptick in interest in doing exactly this with the rise in the price of bitcoin and other digital assets recently asset recovery efforts that may not have been economic just a month or two ago all of a sudden seem like they may be worth devoting resources to and i think this case came at a good time for the industry as a reminder of what they can accomplish if they do devote some resources to a recovery campaignlau it certainly wasn’t necessarily worth it when you once upon a time buy pizza with bitcoin but it certainly is worth it now to your point having hit a number of alltime highs although this case could be seen as a precedent for centralized exchanges what do you think this could mean for decentralized exchanges could this be a benchmark would it even have an impact at all what are your thoughts theresauter so this particular procedure it’s a creature of united states law trying to get back assets in the united statesso decentralized exchanges will present different issues if assets that are going through them are not held in the united states so this particular procedure may not be the way that you would want to trace or recover assets potentially if you’re trying to get them out of account holders or entities or persons who are not located in the united states but nonetheless it is a reminder of how you can link different strategies together as part of an asset recovery campaign and be it a decentralized exchange or a centralized exchange there’s always some real person at the end of the trail and the trick from my perspective is putting together a plan across borders to figure out who that person is and what the best way is to get money back and it’s maybe some combination of law enforcement of that person’s personal assets and actually tracing assets through the blockchainlau do you think there’s enough global cooperation right now among regulators and law enforcementsauter from the perspective of an attorney who’s trying to recover funds on behalf of victims of fraud i think there could be more but over the past few years i think governments around the world have just been trying to get their heads around the technology and understand iti think we’re there now in many parts of the world and hopefully the impetus to begin sharing that knowledge and cooperating to set up a regime where victims of fraud have recourse is sort of the next step in that evolutionlau so on one hand you recovered the funds it’s been returned to the uk liquidators of dooga the perpetrators are understood to be three chinese nationals and a maltabased transaction company what happens there you’ve got an order signed by the northern district of california are there efforts trying to extend the law to these jurisdictions malta chinasauter so i can only get into this so much but the bankruptcy effort that resulted in this turnover of assets is only one of the multiple things that we are trying to do across the world to bring assets back to the estate so you’re right there are many jurisdictions that are involved in this particular matter and we have developed strategic options to sort of leverage different jurisdictionslau for all of those watching and thinking “okay does this mean if i lost my bitcoin i can get it back” what are the basic things that a retail investor can docase number one you lost your password you lost your key i’m thinking of that one guy who has only a couple of chances left on guessing is his code to get to his bitcoin or it’s lost forever where has the level of forensics risen to help people like that there’s no malicious actor it’s that “i don’t even know where my key is”sauter yeah that’s a very unfortunate scenario and i think one that happens more often than we like to hear frankly those people may be out of luck the promise of blockchain technology is that it’s cryptographically secure and many of them especially the cold storage wallet solutions that are out there are specifically designed to not work anymore after a certain number of incorrect passwords and maybe supercomputers will change this one day but for the time being you don’t want to lose those passwords and there’s not much from a legal perspective we can do to help you where we can from a legal perspective come in to help you is when you need information from somebody who doesn’t want to give it to you or you need assets back from somebody who controls them but doesn’t want to give them to you and that’s really where the interaction from the legal system comes into playlau and finally for those regulators and government officials who believe that forensically there’s still enough opaqueness to hide ‘funny business’ what in actuality are regulators or government officials be assured about in the ability to actually trace malicious actorssauter well in the united states for example the fbi in many cases  become very sophisticated at it and it’s not that rare to find press releases issued by the us government of them having seized hardware servers cold storage wallets and used their ability to find passwords and actually take into their control bitcoin or other digital assets that could be accessed through those passwords so it’s become something that in particular the us government has focused on cases of cybercrimethere are a lot of examples of the fbi seizing and taking control of bitcoin and sometimes returning those to victims as well so i do expect  you’ll see more of that particularly as it becomes more and more mainstream for people to hold their assets in a digital form it will become increasingly important not just for law enforcement but for trustees of the companies and liquidators of companies and really anybody who comes in to control a company to understand how to marshal those assets and get them to the right peoplelau i know that you are increasingly busy so i appreciate the time that you’ve spent with us and informing and educating a global audience to understand that it can be traced truly around the world ben just one last question real quick i know that you’re fielding a lot more calls as the price of bitcoin and cryptocurrency has risen how much more busy are you would you say in terms of your office    percent what’s the percentage increase you’ve experiencedsauter that’s probably a good estimate my practice and my firm’s practice focuses exclusively on disputes and investigations we tend to see an increased volume of calls when people are involved in disputes and we tend to see more disputes when volatility hits the market either because it’s worth a lot more and people realize there’s value in getting their fair share of it or when prices fall then people tend to fight over what remains with the volatility comes i think more interest in litigationlau you’re going to be one of those markers for me that’s for sure ben sauter as usual always a pleasure to speak with you and i know you’re going to be headed for a busy year but we always appreciate the time that you spend educating us all about the latest thing in this industry ben sauter there partner of kobre  kim thanks for joining usben sauter thank you angie thank you for having melau and thank you everyone for joining us on this latest episode of word on the block i’m angie lau editorinchief of forkastnews until the next time
