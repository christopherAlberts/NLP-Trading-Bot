goldman sachs private wealth management advisers tell the banks clients to stay invested primarily in us equities advice the firm has reiterated annually since the march  market bottom“we have had a theme of us preeminence and staying invested — these two investment themes — since the trough of the global financial crisis so as many people have put forth the view that the global financial crisis for example dealt a fatal blow to us preeminence that the  century was that of the us the  century belongs to china we took a very strong stand and said no that is not the case and the implication of that for our clients is that they should have much higher allocation strategically to us assets that a marketcapweighted index would suggest and weve reiterated that over the years sharmin mossavarrahmani cio and head of the investment strategy group at goldman sachs said on a call this weekthis week the investment strategy group published its  note titled “us resilient” an annual outlook sent to the firms wealth management clients the note shows data comparing the us to china across a broad series of metrics“its very hard to actually imagine that anybody is going to knock the us off its perch anytime in the near future and that includes china” mossavarrahmani saidin the note coauthored by brett nelson the groups head of tactical asset allocation goldman pointed out that its recommended staying invested in us stocks on  separate occasions since march  including when the sp  declined  between september and december  and more recently during its  drop between feb  and march  due to the pandemic the same advice was given during market rallies toogoldman noted that us equities had gained  or  annualized since march  far outpacing developed markets outside the us and emerging markets equities us stocks have also outperformed other assets such as treasuries high yield securities gold oil and alternative assets such as hedge funds and private equitystory continuesgoldman also argues that those predicting a decline in the uss preeminence will be “proven wrong” according to goldman us preeminence is underpinned by the strength of its institutions and economy goldman wrote that the “resilience of american institutions and democracy is often underappreciated” pointing to  million ballots cast in the  general election during a pandemic whats more the uss economy is supported by its natural resources talent and “vibrant innovative and efficient private corporate sector”to be sure goldman emphasizes that the us is not “immune from recessions equity market downdrafts policy mistakes and pandemic shocks or that it can address such shocks better than other countries”“we actually tell clients that the likelihood of for example a  pullback based on history is  and in fact if you saw this exhibit just a few years ago before  that number would have been  so were telling clients that being invested in equities means were going to have pullbacks the probability of a  pullback is  and sometimes when you see some speculation in some sectors or maybe too much shortterm optimism youre going to see these kinds of pullbacks so we do tell clients that they should be expecting something like that” mossavarrahmani saidbitcoin doesnt belong in the portfoliothis content is not available due to your privacy preferences update your settings here to see itelsewhere the recent runup in bitcoin btcusd has garnered the firms clients attention about the cryptocurrency and the role it might play within a portfolio goldman said it would not recommend bitcoin as an investable asset class in a portfolioin response to a question from yahoo finance mossavarrahmani outlined some issues with bitcoin noting that “something with a longterm volatility of  cant be a medium of exchange”“first of all even the biggest proponents of bitcoin have now abandoned the theme that bitcoin is a medium of exchange so as a currency will it be used for trading purposes and the answer is no theyve abandoned that its not a medium of exchange even though initially that was the theme” mossavarrahmani addedthe cio also said that bitcoin is certainly not a unit of value challenging its role as a currency whats more its volatility also hinders its store of value argument she saidthe question we ask ourselves is who assigns that value so the same way you had that grouping of people liking a particular stock and talking about some of these stocks over the last several weeks and driving up the price does that make it a real value if something goes up  as we saw with for example gamestop gme and then back down  if you think about the amount of money some people made but also a lot of people lost somebody traded gamestop and bought it at  for example so just everybody piles into an idea and talks it up doesnt necessarily mean its a store of value mossavarrahmani addedwhile bitcoin has a total fixed supply with a hardcoded total supply of  million bitcoins it could be subject to competition within its spacewell if theres a particular value that bitcoin puts forth or that value could be put forth by ethereum it could be put forth by all the other cryptocurrencies theres nothing unique about it other than everybody saying ‘its scarce so it will be more valuable but theres nothing tangible there she addedmossavarrahmani said that investors trying to hedge a portfolio against a big downdraft are better off with us treasuries while stocks have historically been a better hedge against inflationif youre trying to hedge against inflation history and again i realize there wasnt a bitcoin at that time but history shows you that actually equities are the best asset class for store of value she saidshe noted that even those who support bitcoin acknowledge a probability that it could go to zero“so even the biggest proponents will say its probably at least  probability that it goes to zero nobody would say that about the sp in the long run it can have volatility high to low the global financial crisis it could be down  but its not going to zero on a longterm value basis and so we actually dont buy into the argument” she said“we tell clients if they want to speculate on something that could have huge upside because more and more people will talk about it people will be concerned about investing because of the fear of missing out on something thats up that much sure it can go higher we tell clients we dont know but we dont think theres a way of actually knowing is this good value or not good value” mossavarrahmani saidfinally with the incredible amount of electricity used to mine bitcoin mossavarrahmani makes a case that “it seems a little bit contrary” for esg environmental sustainability governance focused investorsso people could speculate but its not something that we would recommend to clients as an investable asset class in a portfolio she saidto be sure goldman likes blockchain technology and thinks it will have many uses mossavarrahmanis team also supports the idea of a digital currency“the idea of having a digital currency including whether its from the central bank in china whether its in the ecb or whether its the federal reserve having digital currencies can make transactions and global flow of assets much easier so we also support the concept of having a digital currency but its the concept of a cryptocurrency” she saidjulia la roche is a correspondent for yahoo finance follow her on twitter
