around the holiday period will not take place this year why the impact of retail traders in china has been reducedsome argue the “chinese new year dump” will not happen this year because institutional investors in the us and europe have been the main drivers of the current bull run that is in contrast to ’s bull market which was heavily powered by retail investors in asiameanwhile many on chineselanguage social media platforms are discussing whether the current bitcoin bull market would be forced to pause during the holiday seasonconcern about the chinese new year’s effect is

cofounder shixing “discus fish” mao told coindesk “the current market is driven by institutional money and it moves with the emotions of these western institutions we cannot simply come to any conclusions on  price’s trend based on retailers’ behaviors”an added factor china’s crackdown on otc deskschina’s crackdown on the overthecounter otc service is another potential reason fewer people are cashing out ahead of new year’s said people who are familiar with the matteras coindesk reported previously chinese crypto investors using otc merchants have faced challenges liquidating their crypto holdings for cash because chinese police have been freezing otcrelated bank accounts and cards amid the chinese government’s crackdown on money laundering via cryptocurrenciesunregulated digital currency outflows worth a total of  billion in  were up  from  according to an antimoney laundering report published on feb  by chinabased blockchain analysis firm peckshielda representative from peckshield told coindesk that some crypto users on major crypto exchanges could have found their bank accounts frozen because their otc transactions may have accidentally participated in money laundering activities without realizing it“these accounts were ‘contaminated’ and therefore they were eventually temporarily frozen by the chinese authorities” the representative saidthe crackdown on otcrelated money laundering activities and socalled “card freeze” action have continued into  according to peckshield china’s central bank and the state administration of foreign exchange issued a new notice recently to further guide banks on how to operate their crossborder businesses tightening the clampdown on money laundering and terrorist financingnotebly at least one key huobi executive is still in custody in china due to investigations related to huobi’s otc trading business“it was so easy to sell your cryptocurrencies via otc desks and change them to chinese yuan immediately” said a source to coindesk speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject “it’s highly likely to have your bank accounts frozen this year when the transactions involve those otc merchants” remains a wild cardeven though the coronavirus pandemic is being treated as if it were well under control in china compared with most western countries a new number of cases in the past month has led the chinese government to put more restrictions on traveling around the holiday time in the countrysome say the uncertainty around the  restrictions during the holiday season could have an impact on the crypto markethedgeye’s wang whose research work concentrates on the chinese equities markets sees new and strong retail interest in chinese financial market since december due to an eagerness to invest in china and a “flurry” of ipos from chinese companiesdata from a december report by the china securities depository and clearing corporation shows there are more than  million newly registered individual stock investors in china in december alone nearly double the number of the previous yearbecause people cannot travel and the stock market is closed during the holiday week according to wang there could be some negative impact on the crypto marketwang notes an that stock market prices chinese mainlandbased stock exchanges have been found to move in the opposite direction of macau’s gambling revenues and visitation“sometimes there’s an inverse correlation ” wang said “because if you can’t bet on the stock market you go gamble your money in casinos”one possible sign of things to come may have been what just happened in the us where retail stock traders rushed to crypto when they were frustrated by the restrictions on their stock buying on online platforms such as robinhood
