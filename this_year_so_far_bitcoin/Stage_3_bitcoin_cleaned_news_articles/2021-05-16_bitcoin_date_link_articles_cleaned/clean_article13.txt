coinbase coin seems to be down in the dumps since its recordsetting ipo from late april  the weakness in coinbase has much to do with the valuation of btc and its heightened exposure to digital goldbitcoin btcusd continues to struggle on the week dropping from  per coin to  per coin in the span of  trading sessions the inevitable volatility of this asset class may finally catchup to coin stock holdersby the numbers coinbase reported that it had  in trading volume bitcoin represented  and ethereum represented  of traded volume basically btc and eth represent about  of coinbase’s traded volumehowever bitcoin is down  from its  peak and ethereum is also down by  from its  peak this is typical of the beginning stages of a cryptocurrency meltdown usually the bigger coins tend to sell off and the rest of the alts tend to get carried away on stretchersbitcoin has reached a key threshold in terms of btc dominance in relation to market cap and the same could be said for ethereum as well typically the btc market tends to correct at around  market dominance with ethereum peak market dominance hovering at  equivalent from the prior market high in we are currently at those levelsat this point it would be safe to assume that bitcoin dominance will begin to trend higher as the price of alts continue to decline we think there could be a couple weeks at most before a wave of alts selloffwhat’s offsetting the  episode could be the accessibility of alt coins on a number of exchanges but more particularly coinbase though the dominance patterns in terms of btceth market cap to alts have reemerged the availability of alt coins with direct currency trading pairs has also increased basically there’s more onramps so it could be a while longer before frothy valuations start to deflate and in turn more negative headlines continue to put pressure on the most recent wave of crypto maniadon’t be surprised if and when your favorite pundits push out a bunch of “to the moon or lamborghini comments” heck we expect a negative and harsh response from members of the cryptocurrency community upon publicationwhat about coinbase stockwell if we witness another wave of fearbased selling like  all bets are off mainly because surviving through a negative cycle is much more difficult than many of the motivational survivors from past fearbust cycles will admit publiclythat being said the stock’s valuation will deteriorate on the basis of weakening trading volumes initially a selloff may trigger a lot of volume which could in turn boost business metrics but because the value of assets are trending lower and lower the average value of transactions will drop as wellin other words coinbase is just as exposed to a btceth price meltdown both because revenue and value of assets on platform will respond poorly to a market rout in the price of both keep in mind  of assets on coinbase platform are valued in bitcoin or ethereum terms which means that if the price of bitcoin and ethereum were to drop by  is certainly plausible the value of coinbase assets would drop from  as of ’ figures to  but perhaps less with withdrawals factored inkeep in mind roughly  of coinbase’s assets are measured in fiat terms so the remaining  of assets are in cryptocurrency terms these assets would weather a  to  pullback pretty poorly and the underlying exchange coinbase would likely report a combination of asset outflows asset value losses diminished trade fees and weakness in volume metricsthe cryptocurrency markets tend to revolve in cycles and investors in coinbase aren’t immune to what could occur if the risks outweigh the implied upside it’s because you’re buying near the peakdisclosure cho research was not compensated by coinbase to publish “coinbase will crash when
