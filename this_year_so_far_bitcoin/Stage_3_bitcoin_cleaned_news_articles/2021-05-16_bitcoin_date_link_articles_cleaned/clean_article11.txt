as the price of bitcoin hits record highs and cryptocurrencies become increasingly mainstream the industry’s expanding carbon footprint becomes harder to ignorejust last week elon musk announced that tesla is suspending vehicle purchases using bitcoin due to the environmental impact of fossil fuels used in bitcoin mining we applaud this decision and it brings to light the severity of the situation — the industry needs to address crypto sustainability now or risk hindering crypto innovation and progressthe market cap of bitcoin today is a whopping  trillion as companies like paypal visa and square collectively invest billions in crypto market participants need to lead in dramatically reducing the industry’s collective environmental impactas the price of bitcoin hits record highs and cryptocurrencies become increasingly mainstream the industry’s expanding carbon footprint becomes harder to ignorethe increasing demand for crypto means intensifying competition and higher energy use among mining operators for example during the second half of february we saw the electricity consumption of btc increase by more than  — from  twh to  twh — as the price skyrocketedsustainability has become a topic of concern on the agendas of global and local leaders the biden administration rejoining the paris climate accord was the first indication of this and recently we’ve seen several federal and state agencies make statements that show how much of a priority it will be to address the global climate crisisa proposed new york bill aims to prohibit crypto mining centers from operating until the state can assess their full environmental impact earlier this year the us securities and exchange commission put out a call for public comment on climate disclosures as shareholders increasingly want information on what companies are doing in this regard while treasury secretary janet yellen warned that the amount of energy consumed in processing bitcoin is “staggering” the united kingdom announced plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least  by  and the prime minister launched an ambitious plan last year for a green industrial revolutioncrypto is here to stay — this point is no longer up for debate it is creating realworld benefits for businesses and consumers alike — benefits like faster more reliable and cheaper transactions with greater transparency than ever before but as the industry matures sustainability must be at the center it’s easier to build a more sustainable ecosystem now than to “reverse engineer” it at a later growth stage those in the cryptocurrency markets should consider the auto industry a canary carmakers are now retrofitting lowercarbon and carbonneutral solutions at great cost and inconveniencemarket participants need to actively work together to realize a lowemissions future powered by clean renewable energy last month the crypto climate accord cca launched with over  supporters — including ripple world economic forum energy web foundation rocky mountain institute and consensys — and the goal to enable all of the world’s blockchains to be powered by  renewables by some industry participants are exploring renewable energy solutions but the larger industry still has a long way to go while  of hashers claim they are using renewable energy to power their activities only  of hashing’s total energy consumption comes from renewablesto make a meaningful impact the industry needs to come up with a standard that’s open and transparent to measure the use of renewables and make renewable energy accessible and cheap for miners the cca is already working on such a standard in addition companies can pay for highquality carbon offsets for remaining emissions — and perhaps even historical oneswhile the industry works to become more sustainable long term there are green choices that can be made now and some industry players are jumping on board fintechs like stripe have created carbon renewal programs to encourage its customers and partners to be more sustainablecompanies can partner with organizations like energy web foundation and the renewable energy business alliance to decarbonize any blockchain there are resources for those who want to access renewable energy sources and highquality carbon offsets other options include using inherently lowcarbon technologies like the xrp ledger that don’t rely on proofofwork which involves mining to help significantly reduce emissions for blockchains and cryptofinancethe xrp ledger is carbonneutral and uses a validation and security algorithm called federated consensus that is approximately  times more energyefficient than proofofwork ethereum the secondlargest blockchain is transitioning off proofofwork to a much less energyintensive validation mechanism called proofofstake proofofwork systems are inefficient by design and as such will always require more energy to maintain forward progressthe devastating impact of climate change is moving at an alarming speed making aspirational commitments to sustainability — or worse denying the problem — isn’t enough as with the paris agreement the industry needs real targets collective action innovation and shared accountabilitythe good news solutions can be practical marketdriven and create value and growth for all together with climate advocates clean tech industry leaders and global finance decisionmakers crypto can unite to position blockchain as the most sustainable path forward in creating a green digital financial future
