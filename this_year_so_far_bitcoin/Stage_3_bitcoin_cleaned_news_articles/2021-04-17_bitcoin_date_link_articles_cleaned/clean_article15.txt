after breaking out of the twomonths ascending triangle the price of bitcoin btc is firmly staying above  current onchain volume suggests investors are still strongly buying bitcoin at current price levelsfurthermore the current price is not even close to a shortterm price top when comparing to historic network valuation multiplesbtc price bull run not overheated investor activity showswhile bear market bottoms often coincide with seller exhaustion bull cycle tops happen to occur with buyer exhaustion watching longterm investor activity during the different stages in a bull market proved to be a good indicator for btc price support levels and overheated conditions in the past current investor activity suggests that the market price is far from overheatedonchain analyst willy woo who developed a methodology to measure this activity describes it as follows“investor activity” is predicated on onchain volume this is because when btc moves between wallets between two different participants we assume there was a payment for it offchain fiat or altcoin it’s an imperfect measure but approximates what’s going onthe investor activity expressed in onchain volume is then multiplied by the  moving median of the network value over transactions nvt and is then divided by the circulating supply the price that is derived through this methodology is called nvt pricebitcoin nvt price source woobullcomnvt price does not only give a good indication of how much volume is willing to pay current prices but it can also be used as an estimate of the price floor in a bull market due to the longterm moving average of nvt therefore nvt could also be called the valuation multiple of the network derived from transaction volume or could be thought of as the pe or price to earnings ratio of bitcoinnvt premium says shortterm top possible at the market price rarely dipped below the nvt price during a bull market if it did it proved to be an excellent buying opportunity the current nvt price is  based on yesterdays closing price of  per bitcoin the market is willing to pay a premium of  times the current longterm investor valuation this multiple is called the nvt premiumduring prior bull markets nvt premiums above  turned out to be shortterm price tops and above  marked the top of a bull market currently this metric suggests that the current nvt premium of  is nowhere near prior bull market topsbased on the current nvt price of  the next major shortterm top with an nvt premium of  could likely be at or above  while a potential cycle top with an nvt premium of  could be at or above current nvt premium suggests more upside potentialwhile an nvt premium of  may see a shortterm drop in the price by  or more the multiple also shows that it would be at least another  price increase from yesterdays closing price to reach a potential shortterm cycle tophowever this assumes that history will repeat again and that similar nvt premiums as in prior bull markets would be reached again neither is guaranteed of course nevertheless if this phenomenon were to repeat the risktoreward ratio certainly favors the upsidewhats more a  price tag may actually be a fairly conservative prediction according to woo as cointelegraph previously reported the analyst explained that btc price could also reach as high as  by december  based on other metricsthe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of cointelegraph nothing here should be considered investment or trading advice past performance is not a guarantee of future results every investment and trading move involves risk the author owns bitcoin you should conduct your own research when making a decision andor consult with a financial advisor
