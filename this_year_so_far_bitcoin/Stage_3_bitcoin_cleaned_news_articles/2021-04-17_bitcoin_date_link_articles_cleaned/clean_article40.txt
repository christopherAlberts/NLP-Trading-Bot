cryptominers have exacerbated graphics card shortages in recent times adding to the problems faced by frustrated gamers looking to buy a new gpu and a fresh cryptocurrency on the scene might just eventually impact a different set of pc components – namely driveschia which is still yet to be made available to buy is designed to be an ecofriendly cryptocurrency so instead of relying on powerhungry gpus or asic devices it leverages the power of drives ssds or hard disks which use way less powerhowever assuming that chia successfully establishes itself as a greenfriendly alternative in the cryptocurrency sphere the problem is that solidstate drives or hard drives could be bought up by miners or rather ‘farmers’ – we’ll come back to that laterindeed as hong kongbased tech site hkepc reports as spotted by tom’s hardware this is already happening over in asia – indeed there is talk of ‘panic buying’the hong kong market has seen a spike in sales of hard drives of  to  capacities so much so that the prediction is that due to demand hard drive and ssd prices could go up in hong kong by  hkd to  hkd which is about  to  or so around £ to £ or  to which is a worrying development on top of the existing supply chain problems caused by the pandemic and recent reports of a lack of key components and a power outage which is expected to push ssd prices up a chunkthe better news is that the ssds being sought out are enterprise models with high endurance because chia pushes drives with constant reading and writing – but consumer ssds might be used in a pinchtom’s further notes that one of the major manufacturers in china jiahe jinwei has told mydrivers that it has sold out of some highend  and  nvme ssds already – and the firm says it will be implementing restrictions to stop miners from hoovering up consumer models indeed apparently jiahe jinwei is planning to market an ssd specifically for cryptocurrency use in much the same way that there are dedicated gpus for minersproof of space and timehow exactly does chia work you might be wondering rather than the traditional cryptocurrency ‘proof of work’ model chia – which is the brainchild of bram cohen the inventor of bittorrent – runs on a ‘proof of space and time’ basis proof of space referring to storage capacity with time added as an additional factoras the chia faq explains “proof of space is a cryptographic technique where provers show that they allocate unused hard drive space for storage space in order to be used as a consensus method proof of space must be tied to proof of time pot ensures that block times have consistency in the time between them and increases the overall security of the blockchain”the gist of it is that rather than having huge electricitysapping mining efforts chia can be ‘farmed’ with those farmers allocating sections plots of their drives dedicated to the cryptocurrencythe makers observe “farming remains decentralized because anyone that has installed our software and has plots can win the next block …  relies on empty hard disk space and anyone with a mobile phone laptop or corporate network tends to have extra space not currently being used“unlike mining once you’re done farming your storage you can repurpose it to for example store your family photos”as mentioned chia is yet to launch as a digital commodity you can buy but it is currently in a prefarming phase as the faq explainstechradar is supported by its audience techradar does not endorse any specific cryptocurrencies or blockchainbased services and readers should not interpret techradar content as investment advice our reporters hold only small quantities of cryptocurrency under  in value as is necessary to perform wallet and exchange reviews and do not hold shares in any publicly listed cryptocurrency companies
