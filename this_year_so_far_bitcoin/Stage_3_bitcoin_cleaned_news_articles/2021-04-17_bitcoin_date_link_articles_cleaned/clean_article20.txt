the nordic region is losing its edge in green bitcoin mining just as the industry faces growing scrutiny for its carbon emissions and everyone from elon musk to momandpop investors pile iniceland sweden and norway have been popular mining locations because of an abundance of geothermal hydro and wind power china where most coins are mined relies mainly on coal that nordic power surplus is set to dwindle as aluminum smelters oil rigs and steel makers thirst for renewable energy“there could be very little excess energy in  and ” said hordur arnarson chief executive at landsvirkjun iceland’s national utility “because of the climate issues we see a lot of very interesting segments that are growing rapidly and several of them need electricity”the coins are mined by computers that process complex algorithms in halls as big as airport hangars that makes electricity one of the key inputs consuming as much power as thousands of households and it keeps growing bitcoin mining now uses  times more electricity than in  and carbon emissions from the process may face increasing regulation citigroup said in a recent reportemissions from mining coins in china are expected to peak in  releasing as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as all of italy according to a study published in nature communicationsiceland was the pioneer in green mining until four years ago it hosted as much as  per cent of global bitcoin production the icelandic blockchain foundation said a figure that’s now down to less than  per cent the university of cambridge put the contribution even lower at  per cent in april  the most recent data available by comparison china accounted for  per cent theniceland’s biggest electricity consumers are the giant smelters built decades ago to benefit from the cheap power with aluminum prices surging plants owned by rio tinto and others will consume more electricity after a slowdown in  according to landsvirkjunit’s unclear exactly how many cryptocurrency miners operate in the region hive blockchain technologies from canada has expanded mining at home as well as in iceland and sweden this year hong konglisted genesis mining has facilities in sweden and iceland bitfury holding has also been active on the volcanic island none of them responded to questions about the region’s future rolegisli kr katrinarson chief commercial officer at atnorth iceland’s biggest data center operator and home to some miners says he does not see an energy shortageas bitcoin sailed through  for the first time this month daniel fannar jonsson chief executive at new mining company greenblocks is bullish he cites iceland’s prominent history in the industry and says carbonfree power is still a big pluselsewhere in the nordic region new green and energyintensive industries will produce everything from carbonfree steel to hydrogen and ammonia their selling point is that they boost the economy by creating thousands of jobs while helping to reduce emissions bitcoin mining on the other hand offers little back to societybitcoin mining is problematic as “it leads to an almost infinitely increasing energy demand” said espen barth eide the norwegian labour party’s top energy lawmaker “it will displace other far more productive industries”norway’s electrification programme will boost power demand  per cent by  according to grid manager statnett sf the country known as europe’s green battery because of its vast hydro resources is poised to send more electricity to the continent through new cables which will curb availability for new large usersthe nordic power surplus excluding iceland is expected to shrink by  per cent from  to the end of the decade according to industry consultant volue insights new demand will mainly be for hydrogen production and data centerswhile iceland built a separate hydropower plant to allow for a new smelter in  that courtesy would not be extended to bitcoin miners according to mr arnarson“nobody would build a power plant for bitcoin” he said “there’s a lot of uncertainty about the future development”cryptocurrencies emerged as an alternative investment in the past decade but have famously whipsawed investors a spectacular crash three years ago left it ice cold it’s been spurned by billionaire investors including warren buffett and loved by business mavericks such as mr muskit’s on a tear again having doubled in value this yeargoldman sachs group and morgan stanley plan to offer their clients access to crypto investments tesla earlier this year disclosed a  billion investment in bitcoin and now accepts it as payment for its electric carsback on iceland johann snorri sigurbergsson business development manager at the hs orka power plant says the nation is closer to an energy shortage than a glut his company is busy adding capacity on the reykanes peninsula in the southwestwhile he’s open to eventually taking on more customers right now the price would need to be “pretty high”“we would need to buy some energy from the market to be able to serve them” he said “but that kind of business case is not the price the miners are looking for”
