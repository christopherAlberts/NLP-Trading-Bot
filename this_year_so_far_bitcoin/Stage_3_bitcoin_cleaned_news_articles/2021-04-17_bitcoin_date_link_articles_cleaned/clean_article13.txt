positive divergence of the largecap gdmntr stocks may suggest the gold price weakness has run its coursekeeping tabs on deficit spending and the looming lunch billthe congressional budget office cbo reports that the  federal deficit totaled  trillion or a record  of gdp perhaps most people don’t quite grasp how much a trillion is as it gets bandied around so much—million billion trillion whatever each trillion in debt is equivalent to  for every household in america the total deficit is currently  trillion the cbo forecasts a  deficit of  trillion or  of gdp which doesn’t include the  trillion spending bill passed in march president joe biden is now asking for trillions more for infrastructure green initiatives and social welfare meanwhile the fed keeps buying government debt and limits debt service costs with low rates in a sane world this would be labelled currency debasement yet the dollar has been trending higher since january the market sees all of this deficit spending going towards economic growth with no side effectsaccording to a wall street journal oped piece by phil gramm and mike solon the purchasing power of american families reached record highs in  total employee compensation was down by  billion yet government personal transfers rose by  billion this was before the  billion december stimulus took effect this suggests that the government’s response to the pandemic went far beyond those who were truly harmedsomebody once said “there’s no such thing as a free lunch” we believe that sometime in the coming years the lunch bill will come debt and the expansion of the money supply could have any of several consequencesif longterm rates lurch higher from here debt service could become a big problemproblems may arise if the fed ever stops funding the government likewise if foreigners stop buying treasuriesonce the profligate spending stops will the economy be able to withstand the increased regulations and higher taxes the administration has plannedan inflationary spiral would create problems unseen for decadesgold and gold stocks may hedge against these risksacceptance of bitcoin no longer in questionthe gold vs bitcoin question comes up more than ever now there have been some interesting developments around bitcoin showing that it has come into wider use the bitcoin market has historically been retail oriented both in terms of its use in transactions and as an investment however over the past year bitcoin has made significant inroads to the institutional realm its expanding list of adherents includes corporates highnet worth individuals endowments and fund companies it trades on the cme futures exchange and as a nasdaqlisted trust worth  billion as of endmarch according to bloomberg several prominent custodial banks have announced plans to service bitcoin in march citibank released a comprehensive  page report on bitcoin it appears it can no longer be dismissed as a fad or tech curiosity the chart shows that while bitcoin is more volatile than gold or gold stocks the volatility profile is stabilizing indicative of a maturing speculative asset classbitcoin volatility stabilization evidence of maturing asset classsource bloomberg vaneck data as of march   volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index and is measured here using standard deviation of returns on  rolling time period standard deviation is a statistical measurement of dispersion about an average which depicts how widely the returns varied over a certain period of time past performance is no guarantee of future resultsthere are however major logistical issues facing bitcoin including the low speed and cost of transactions how regulatory bodies will treat it whether some governments will allow it how it is taxed how it is collateralized and insured and how to prevent hacks and illicit activity bitcoin is a new asset class with high volatility and is part of a stimulusfueled mania according to a cambridge center for alternative finance report bitcoin has a carbon footprint equivalent to that of new zealand assuming all of this can be ironed out over time where does bitcoin land in the investment universe and does it affect goldthe gold vs bitcoin debate continuesbitcoin’s greatest potential is as a decentralized global payment system and substitute for cash many investors believe bitcoin is a store of value and it could certainly become a hedge against currency debasementthe reason investors focus on gold vs bitcoin and not other cryptocurrencies is the characteristics they have in common both have limited supply sit outside of the mainstream financial system carry no counterparty liabilities are uncorrelated assets and have been used as currencies the antiestablishment ethos of bitcoin users is akin to the lack of trust many gold investors have in the financial systemthere are also stark differences bitcoin is not a tangible asset like paper currency it only has value so long as the public believes it has value without public trust it is worthless gold is real it is used in electronics medicine and aerospace it is displayed on millions of people around the world every day it has utility beyond its use as a store of value and is intertwined with human culture and historytoday’s landscape supports gold and bitcoin working togetherthe dawn of the renaissance also brought a new payment system and store of value in the  century private family banks arose in northern italy that dealt not so much with gold and silver but slips of paper representing gold and silver these “bills of exchange” were a kind of paper currency that helped to overcome the insufficient supplies of gold and silver and put more money into circulation among merchants the system failed when governments became too burdened by debts and moved to cancel the bills of exchange the merchant banks revived in the  century with new vigor under the leadership of florence’s greatest banking family the medici who were the first to create written withdrawals otherwise known as checks to increase the speed and flexibility of the banking system the history of money weatherford  perhaps in the renaissance as now some were calling for the demise of gold as an archaic store of wealth however gold and paper currency have coexisted ever sinceinterest rates have been falling for  years we are entering a postpandemic era where rates have nowhere to go but up the potential for excessive inflation is palpable investment strategies that worked for the last  years are not likely to work in the foreseeable future this investment landscape of risk and uncertainty is amenable to both gold and bitcoin while bitcoin may steal some gold investors at the margin it is also likely to attract new investors to the safehaven realm where gold and silver are established perhaps gold will find new use as a stabilizer in volatile crypto funds in any case it is not a gold vs bitcoin world it is a gold and bitcoin world where both can coexistdownload commentary pdf with fund specific information and performanceoriginally published by
