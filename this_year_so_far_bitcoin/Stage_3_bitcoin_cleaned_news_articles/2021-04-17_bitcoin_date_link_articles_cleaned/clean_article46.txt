theres a pretty good chance that when the curtain closes on  its going to be remembered as the year of the retail investorbeginning in midjanuary retail investors on reddits wallstreetbets chatroom began banding together to target stocks with very high levels of short interest the goal for these relatively young investors has been to effect a short squeeze  ie an event where pessimists effectively run for the hills and cover their short positions sending a rising stock price skyrocketing higherover the past three months weve watched as dozens of companies have been hit with retail investorfueled short squeezes to some varying degree while many of these squeezes last a couple of days at most a few have generated lasting gains perhaps none is more famous than video game and accessories retailer gamestop nysegmea nearly  bet on gamestop a year ago would have made you a millionairegamestop is the company that started the reddit frenzy it was the only publicly traded company in midjanuary that had a short interest relative to float of more than  this made it the perfect target for retail investors who bought shares and outofthemoney calls in gamestop three months after the initial squeeze gamestops share price is still up by more than whats more gamestops oneyear returns are truly jawdropping investors who had the foresight stomach and luck to put their money to work in the struggling gaming company one year ago as of april  are sitting on gains of  to put this into some context if you invested  in gamestop on april   youre now a millionaireand yet gamestops nearly   gain is only the eighthbest performance among stocks with a market cap of at least  million the following three highfliers have not just outperformed gamestop over the trailing year  theyve at least doubled up its  gainriot blockchain up  over the trailing yearheres an idea to wrap your head around cryptocurrency mining company riot blockchain nasdaqriot has gained almost  over the trailing year  and thats only good enough for the thirdbest performance among publicly listed companies with a market cap of at least  millioncryptocurrency miners are people or companies that use highpowered computers to solve highly complex mathematical equations for a group of transactions known as a block resolving these equations verifies and validates transactions on a cryptocurrency network resulting in the person or company being paid a block rewardriot blockchain specifically focuses on mining bitcoin cryptobtc the worlds largest digital currency by market cap following news just over a week ago that it had placed an order for   antminers from bitmain itll have in the neighborhood of  antminers in service when fully deployed according to the press release riot isnt expected to receive all of its ordered miners until october furthermore a day after its huge bitmain order the company announced a cashandstock deal worth  million to acquire whinstone the operator of north americas largest bitcoin hosting facility with this acquisition and the antminer order riot effectively blew through most of its cash on handthough a higher bitcoin price helps riot generate additional revenue the company is facing increased competition in an industry with virtually no barrier to entry additionally the block reward for bitcoin currently  tokens halves every couple of years and lets not forget that bitcoin has had three separate  or greater pullbacks over the past decade riot is a company thats nearly devoid of innovation and entirely reliant on an external catalyst bitcoin to head higher this suggests its gains may prove fleetingmicrovision up  over the trailing yearanother company that essentially doubled up gamestops spectacular oneyear performance is scanning and sensor technology company microvision nasdaqmvis once a microcap stock microvision is now sporting a hearty  billion market cap and has gained more than  over the trailing  periodthere look to be two catalysts primarily responsible for sending microvision from penny stock territory to borderline midcap status first like gamestop microvision was aided by the reddit frenzy close to half of its gains over the past year began in late january which is when retail investors were hunting down penny stocks or lowvolume plays with reasonably high levels of short interest microvision certainly fit the billthe second upside factor has to do with the companys development of  perceptive light detection and ranging lidar technology the ultimate goal for this potential longrange scanning and sensing technology is that itll be used by automakers for autonomous driving purposes microvision has stuck to its timeline of unveiling samples of its long range lidar sensor sometime this month with autonomous driving representing one of the fastestgrowing opportunities of the decade theres clear buzz that microvisions technology could play a key roleon the other hand were talking about a company thats still prototyping generated only  million in sales last year and lost  million its also been selling stock via atthemarket offerings to raise capital to fund its operations there simply arent any guarantees that a previously unknown scanning technology player will have its technology chosen by automakers for their autonomous driving programsmarathon digital holdings up  over the trailing yeari hope you like your oneyear gains with a side of holy cow because thats precisely what cryptocurrency mining company marathon digital holdings nasdaqmara is delivering in just one year marathons share price has galloped from microcappenny stock territory to  a share and a nearly  billion market cap the  return virtually quadruples gamestops stellar return over the same periodlike riot blockchain marathon digital has been purchasing miners in order to nab its share of the bitcoin mining pie it ended the first quarter with roughly  active miners but has a veritable boatload on order with bitmain approximately  miners will be delivered between october  and january  with all  miners in its active and ordered fleet expected to be operational by the end of march what differentiates marathon from riot blockchain is that it also made a direct investment in bitcoin in late january the company purchased more than  bitcoin at an average price of  with bitcoin crossing  earlier this week marathons  million investment has doubled to a little over  million in theory having more bitcoin on its balance sheet should help to better shield marathon from large moves lower in the price of bitcoin this is to say that while the mining operation model could be unsustainable if bitcoin prices fall too much marathon will still hold value since it now owns  bitcoinnonetheless its difficult to overlook the many red flags facing the crypto mining industry there are huge capital input costs and very little reliance on the innovation that investors lean on from businesses to drive valuation multiples these are the reasons ive referred to crypto miners as the worst possible way to invest in bitcoin
