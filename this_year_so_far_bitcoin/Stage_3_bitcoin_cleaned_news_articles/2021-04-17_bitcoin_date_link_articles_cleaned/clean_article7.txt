stopped selling their coins again in the last weekfutures contracts recently recorded an alltime high but their relation to the spot positions points to a healthy reset by contrast the longterm hodl

with daily close resistance at  despite reaching the new alltime high the bitcoin volume still seems to be in a downtrend this is a signal that the volatility of the main cryptocurrency is stabilizing and a large price movement either up or down is still ahead of ushodlers no longer sellingthe first indicator of onchain analysis that shows a clear change in the behavior of longterm investors is the longterm holder net position change since january  we have seen a significant decrease in their sales activity blue arrowhowever in the last week this indicator started generating green bars again blue circle this means that most longterm investors are no longer selling but accumulate their positions in anticipation of further increasesconfirmation of this trend can be found in another bitcoin indicator liquidityilliquidity supply change it turns out that the liquidity crisis of the main cryptocurrency which started around  is only gaining momentum and is currently reaching new highsthe

the ongoing discussion of the potential bitcoin top which was recently triggered by the cross of the infamous pi cycle top indicator it is worth taking a look at two more longterm onchain chartsthe first is hodl waves which beincrypto has recently discussed in detailbelow we see a hodl waves chart weighted by a realized cap we see historic highs for this indicator blue rectangles that coincide with the bull market ending parabolic increases in the btc pricethese were the periods of maximum bitcoin sales by longterm hodlers smart money to retail investors fomoing into the market dumb moneywhile we see increases in the red and orange areas we are still not even close to the peaks of previous cyclesthis is confirmed by the second indicator entityadjusted dormancy flow it is the ratio of the current market cap and the annualized dormancy value in usd and can be used to determine the lows and highs for the btc price the more old coins are sold the more this ratio increasesthe historical chart of this indicator also shows room for increases for bitcoin blue arrow we are not even close to the  peak the historic alltime high of  is still a long way offconclusionthe deepening
