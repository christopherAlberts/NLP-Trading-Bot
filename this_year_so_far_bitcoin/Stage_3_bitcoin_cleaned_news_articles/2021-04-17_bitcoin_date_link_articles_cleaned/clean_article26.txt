bitcoin’s green haven is running out of surplus electricitythe nordic region is facing a renewable energy crunch as heavy industries and bitcoin miners compete for clean powerby ragnhildur sigurdardottir lars paulsson and jesper starn  bloombergthe nordic region is losing its edge in green bitcoin mining just as the industry faces growing scrutiny for its carbon emissions and everyone from tesla inc chief executive officer elon musk to momandpop investors pile iniceland sweden and norway have been popular mining locations because of an abundance of geothermal hydro and wind power china where most coins are mined relies mainly on coal that nordic power surplus is set to dwindle as aluminum smelters oil rigs and steelmakers thirst for renewable energy“there could be very little excess energy in  and ” said hordur arnarson chief executive officer at landsvirkjun iceland’s national utility “because of the climate issues we see a lot of very interesting segments that are growing rapidly and several of them need electricity”a lighthouse and a geothermal power plant are pictured on the reykjanes peninsula iceland on feb  photo afpthe coins are mined by computers that process complex algorithms in halls as big as airport hangars that makes electricity one of the key inputs consuming as much power as thousands of households — and it keeps growing bitcoin mining now uses  times more electricity than in  and carbon emissions from the process might face increasing regulation citigroup inc said in a reportemissions from mining coins in china are expected to peak in  releasing as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as all of italy according to a study published in nature communicationsiceland was the pioneer in green mining until four years ago it hosted as much as  percent of global bitcoin production the nation’s blockchain foundation said a figure that is now down to less than  percentthe university of cambridge put the contribution even lower at  percent in april last year the most recent data available by comparison china accounted for  percentgrowing concern about china’s cryptocurrency clout is fueling demand for mining locations elsewhereo’leary funds management lp chairman kevin o’leary earlier this month told cnbc that two kinds of bitcoin would emerge “blood coin” from china and “clean coin” mined using sustainable hydroelectricity where the provenance can be proven and that he would opt for the green oneiceland’s biggest electricity consumers are the giant smelters built decades ago to benefit from the cheap powerwith aluminum prices surging plants owned by rio tinto plc and others would consume more electricity after a slowdown last year landsvirkjun saidit is unclear exactly how many cryptocurrency miners operate in the region hive blockchain technologies ltd from canada has expanded mining at home as well as in iceland and sweden this year hong konglisted genesis mining ltd has facilities in sweden and iceland bitfury holding bv has also been active on the volcanic islandnone of them responded to questions about the region’s future rolegisli kr katrinarson chief commercial officer at atnorth iceland’s biggest data center operator and home to some miners said he does not see an energy shortageas bitcoin sailed through  for the first time this month daniel fannar jonsson the chief executive officer at new mining company greenblocks is bullishhe cited iceland’s prominent history in the industry and said carbonfree power is still a big pluselsewhere in the nordic region new green and energyintensive industries are to produce everything from carbonfree steel to hydrogen and ammoniatheir selling point is that they boost the economy by creating thousands of jobs while helping to reduce emissions bitcoin mining on the other hand offers little back to societybitcoin mining is problematic as “it leads to an almost infinitely increasing energy demand” said espen barth eide the norwegian labor party’s top energy lawmaker “it will displace other far more productive industries”norway’s electrification program is to boost power demand  percent by  according to grid manager statnett sfthe country known as europe’s green battery because of its vast hydro resources is poised to send more electricity to the continent through new cables which would curb availability for new large usersthe nordic power surplus excluding iceland is expected to shrink by  percent from  to the end of the decade industry consultant volue insights as has saidnew demand would mainly be for hydrogen production and data centerswhile iceland built a separate hydropower plant to allow for a new smelter in  that courtesy would not extend to bitcoin miners arnarson said“nobody would build a power plant for bitcoin” he said “there’s a lot of uncertainty about the future development”cryptocurrencies emerged as an alternative investment in the past decade but have famously whipsawed investors a spectacular crash three years ago left it ice cold it has been spurned by billionaire investors including warren buffett and loved by business mavericks such as muskit is on a tear again

would need to buy some energy from the market to be able to serve them” he said “but that kind of business case is not the price the miners are looking for”
