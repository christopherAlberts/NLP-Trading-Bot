in its growth from conceptual white paper to trilliondollar asset bitcoin has attracted an enormous amount of criticism detractors focus on its perceived negative externalities energy consumption carbon footprint lack of centralized control and inability to be regulated regardless of the validity of these arguments few critics stop to think comparatively about the negative externalities of the world’s current financial system of dollar hegemonythis is in part because many bitcoin critics see it as just a visalike payment platform and analyze its performance and costs by “transactions per second” but bitcoin is not a fintech company competing with visa it is a decentralized asset competing to be the new global reserve currency aiming to inherit the role gold once had and the role the dollar holds todaythe world relies on the us dollar and us treasuries giving america unparalleled and outsized economic dominance nearly  of international currency transactions are in dollars  of foreign exchange reserves are held in dollars and almost  of the world’s debt is issued in dollars even though the us only accounts for around  of global gdp this special status that the dollar enjoys was born in the  through a military pact between america and saudi arabia leading the world to price oil in dollars and stockpile us debt as we emerge from the  pandemic and financial crisis american elites continue to enjoy the exorbitant privilege of issuing the ultimate monetary good and numéraire for energy and financethe past few decades have seen a vast global rise in economic activity population democratic progress technological advancement and living standards but there are many flaws in this system that are rarely spoken about and that weigh heavily on billions of people across the globewhat would the world look like with an open neutral predictable base money instead of one controlled and manipulated by one government representing only  of the planet’s population this article explores the seldom discussed and staggering downsides of the current system in the hope that we can replace it with something more fair free and decentralizedthis essay will explore the rarely discussed creation of the petrodollar and lay out how america has supported brutal dictators compromised its national security harmed its industrial base propped up and protected the fossil fuel industry and even waged conflict abroad all to bolster the dollar’s status as global reserve currency while this strategy worked for us leaders for many decades today the world is inexorably moving to a more multipolar financial structure and possibly towards a bitcoin standardi birth of the petrodollarthe british empire was the unquestioned economic hegemon of the  century but began to lose steam early in the  century especially after world war i the united states emerged much healthier than wartorn europe and as the country with by far the most gold by the outbreak of world war ii the dollar had unquestionably eclipsed the pound as the world’s most influential national currencygovernments still relied on gold as the underlying global reserve currency but us and uk policymakers were determined to create a more “flexible” system in the waning months of world war ii leaders from  countries gathered in a hotel in bretton woods new hampshire to choose a new financial bedrock british economist john maynard keynes pushed the idea of the bancor a global unit of account that many nations would manage but the us preferred the idea of the dollar at the center pegged to gold at  per ounce since international trade deficits still had to be settled in gold america’s substantial control of the world’s gold supply and favorable balance of payments position provided the leverage to get its wayover the coming decades the world shifted to the bretton woods standard with national currencies pegged to adjustable dollar amounts where the us was trusted to custody and hold enough gold to prop up the whole system up until the early  it did a reasonably good job dollars became the dominant medium of exchange for international settlement backed by a promise to pay in gold america became the largest creditor nation and an economic powerhouse however after the assassination of president kennedy the us government chose a path of huge social and military spending with president johnson’s “great society” social programs and the invasion of vietnam us debt skyrocketed unlike world war ii or the korean war vietnam was the first american war waged almost entirely on creditas niall ferguson wrote in “ascent of money” “in the late  us public sector deficits were negligible by today’s standards but large enough to prompt complaints from france that washington was exploiting its reserve currency status to collect seigniorage from america’s foreign creditors by printing dollars much as medieval monarchs had exploited their monopoly on minting to debase the currency”french economist jacques reuff called this the “monetary sin of the west” and the french government coined the term “exorbitant privilege” poor british fiscal policy forced a devaluation of the pound in  and the french fearing that unsustainable american spending would result in similar negative results wanted their gold back before a dollar devaluationby  us debt had simply grown too high just  billion in gold backed  billion in dollars that august french president pompidou sent a battleship to new york city to collect his nation’s gold holdings from the federal reserve and the british asked the us to prepare  billion worth of gold held in fort knox for withdrawal in a televised speech on august   president richard nixon told the american people that the us would no longer redeem dollars for gold as part of a plan that included wage and price freezes and an import surcharge in an attempt to save the economy nixon said closing the gold window was temporary but few things are as permanent as temporary measures as a result the dollar was devalued by more than  and the bretton woods system ceased to exist the world entered a major financial crisis though when asked about the impact that the “nixon shock” would have on foreign nations nixon made his position clear “i don’t give a shit about the lira”as david graeber wrote in “debt” “nixon floated the dollar in order to pay for the cost of a war in which he ordered more than four million tons of explosives and incendiaries dropped on cities and villages across indochina… the debt crisis was a direct result of the need to pay for the bombs or to be more precise the vast military infrastructure needed to deliver them this was what was causing such an enormous strain on us gold reserves”for the first time in history the world was in a pure fiat standard the dollars held by central banks across the globe lost their backing and there was a geopolitical moment where us dominance was called into question and where a multipolar financial world was a distinct possibility adding even more pressure in  the arab petroleum exporters of opec decided to quadruple the price of world oil and embargo the us in response to its support for israel during the yom kippur war in just a few years a barrel of oil rose from less than  to nearly  faced with doubledigit inflation and declining global faith in the dollar nixon and his secretary of state and national security advisor henry kissinger came up with an idea that would allow them to keep “guns and butter” going in the postgold standard era and alter the fate of the worldin  they sent new treasury secretary william simon to saudi arabia “to find a way to persuade a hostile kingdom to finance america’s widening deficit with its newfound petrodollar wealth” simply put a petrodollar is a us dollar paid to a petroleum exporter in exchange for oil as a bloomberg report says the basic framework was “strikingly simple” the us would “buy oil from saudi arabia and provide the kingdom military aid and equipment in return the saudis would plow billions of their petrodollar revenue back into treasuries and finance america’s spending” this was the moment that the us dollar was officially married to oilon june   in washington kissinger and crown prince fahd signed agreements establishing saudi investment in the us and american support for the saudi military nixon flew to jeddah a few days later to continue working out details declassified documents later revealed that the us government confidentially enabled the saudis to purchase treasuries “outside regular auctions and at preferential rates” in early  they purchased  billion of treasuries beginning a spree that would later become hundreds of billions of petrodollars invested in us debt decades later gerry parsky who was deputy to treasury secretary simon at the time said that this “secret arrangement with the saudis should have been dismantled years ago” and that he was “surprised the treasury kept it in place for so long” but even so he said he “has no regrets” since “doing the deal was a positive for america”by  other opec nations followed saudi arabia’s lead if you wanted to buy oil from them and their store of nearly  of world petroleum reserves you had to pay in dollars this created new demand for america’s currency at a time of global uncertainty and even at a time of continued inflation industrializing nations needed oil and to get it they now had to either export goods to the united states or buy dollars in foreign exchange markets increasing the dollar’s global network effect in   of global oil was still transacted in the british pound but that number fell to  by  by  saudi imports of us military equipment had risen from  million to more than  billion oil prices boosted by the premium that came with being able to be sold for dollars would remain skyhigh until ii impact of the petrodollarin his research on the petrodollar political economist david spiro argues that opec dollar profits were “recycled” into us treasuries to subsidize the “debthappy policies of the us government as well as the debthappy consumption of its citizenry” petrodollar recycling over time pushed down interest rates and allowed the us to issue debt very cheaply this system was created and held in place not by pure economics but by politics through the pact with saudi arabia as alan greenspan said in  reflecting on his experience as chairman of the council of economic advisers during the ford administration the saudis were “nonmarket decisionmakers”graeber points to petrodollar recycling as an example of how us treasuries replaced gold as the world’s reserve currency and ultimate store of value the kicker he explains was that “over time the combined effect of low interest payments and inflation is that these bonds actually depreciate in value… economists prefer to call it ‘seigniorage’”since its creation in  the petrodollar system has changed the world in many significant ways includingthe creation of a tight alliance between the united states and the saudi arabian dictatorship as well as other tyrannies in the gulf regionthe steep rise of the “eurodollar” shadow global economy as petrodollars created outside the control of the federal reserve flooded banks in london and north america and were then recycled into us treasuries or loaned back out to emerging marketsthe financialization of the american economy as the artificially strong dollar made exports uncompetitive hollowed out the middle class and shifted focus from manufacturing to finance technology defense and services all while increasing the leverage in the systemadditional stress on the soviet union which was now faced with an increasingly dollarized world market where the us could print money to buy oil but it had to dig oil out of the groundpainful issues for emerging market economies which became mired in dollardenominated debt that was difficult to pay back and stuck in a system that prioritized dollar accumulation over domestic investment harming income and triggering debt crises everywhere from mexico to east asia to russia to argentinasteady growth of the oil and fossil fuels industries at the expense of nuclear power and regional energy independenceand of course the continuation of the us as a militaryfinancial hegemon and the ability of the us to run humongous deficits to finance wars and social programs all in part paid for by other countriesthere are petrodollar theory critics who say the phenomenon is largely a myth they say the dollar has been dominant simply because there has been no competition dean baker from the center for economic and policy research has said that “while it is true that oil is priced in dollars and that most oil is traded in dollars these facts make relatively little difference for the status of the dollar as an international currency for the economic wellbeing of the united states”meanwhile modern monetary theorists like warren mosler and stephanie kelton downplay the importance of the petrodollar saying “it doesn’t matter” or “it’s irrelevant” as it does not limit what the us can do domestically and that internationally it does not matter what oil is priced in because countries can just swap currencies before purchase critics point to the fact that the dollar was already the world reserve currency before  and that the pricing of commodities in dollars is “just a convention” and that “there would be no real difference if the euro the yen or even bushels of wheat were selected as the unit of account for the oil market” they also say the dollars involved in the oil trade are “trivial” compared with other sources of demandbut the decision of saudi arabia and opec to price their oil exports in dollars and invest the profits in us debt was not a strict market decision and not one of fortune or happenstance but a political one done in exchange for protection and weapons and one that sparked countless additional network effects that over time solidified the dollar as the world’s reserve currency when countries are forced to exchange their own currencies for dollars to buy oil this strengthens that trading pair for that country extending us influence beyond energy markets in “debt” graeber does mention the debate over whether or not oil sales denominated in dollars give any seigniorage to the us but says that regardless what ultimately matters is “that us policymakers seem to feel the fact that they are symbolically important and resist any attempt to alter this”iii american foreign policy and the petrodollarin october  saddam hussein did attempt to alter the petrodollar system when he announced that iraq would sell oil in euros not dollars by february  he had sold  billion barrels of oil for  billion euros with his french and german trading partners the “petroeuro” was born which if expanded would help a euro market develop against lots of other currencies boosting the euro’s strength and eroding the dollar’s exorbitant privilege but one month later the us aided by the united kingdom invaded iraq and overthrew saddam by june iraq was back to selling oil in dollars againdid america go to war to defend the petrodollar this possibility is almost never discussed in retrospective analyses of the war which tend to fixate on questions of iraq’s alleged weapons of mass destruction stockpile human rights abuses or terror links but at the time the euro was actually seen by many as a realistic challenger to the dollar given that the ouster of saddam in retrospect helped deter change and give the petrodollar system many more years of dominance it seems like one of the more reasonable explanations for the most mysterious war in modern american historylast year the journalist robert draper appeared on ezra klein’s show to discuss his new book “to start a war how the bush administration took america into iraq” with a decade of hindsight they covered many of the possible motives for the invasion but ultimately called it a “war in search for a reason” to this day there is no consensus for why exactly the us invaded iraq and the official reasons have proven to be completely contrivedaccording to former treasury secretary paul o’neill by february  the bush administration was already talking internally about the logistics of invading iraq “not the why” he said “but the how and how quickly” blueprints were already being made on  just a few hours after the attacks thendeputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz ordered a comprehensive study of saddam’s ties to terrorist organizationsover the next  months the bush administration sold the war effort and by march  had achieved wide support especially with the help of secretary of state colin powell who spent his credibility on a pr campaign at the united nations and on news television both houses of congress supported the removal of saddam including senators clinton kerry reid and biden in the media outlets ranging from “fox news” to the new york times supported the invasion as did  of the american people in polling in the weeks leading up to the invasion the public rationale was clear saddam was dangerous was believed to have weapons of mass destruction wmds could slip them to al qaeda and needed to be stopped at the time vice president dick cheney said “there can be no doubt that saddam has wmds” the war was also marketed as a humanitarian effort and was given the name operation iraqi freedom but in retrospect america did not invade iraq to promote human rights there was no connection to al qaeda or  and despite cheney’s promises no wmds were ever foundother motives were and continue to be discussed including countering iran which makes little sense given most iraqis are shia and their political structure ended up tilting more toward iran during the occupation and given that the us had supported saddam in previous decades for this very purpose the flimsy nature of the official reasons for war led many to believe that oil was the root cause this would not be unusual over the past  years natural resources have been at the root of many wars invasions and occupations that have shaped our world including the scramble for africa the great game in central asia the sykespicot treaty the overthrows of mossadegh and lumumba and the first gulf wargeorge w bush colin powell secretary of defense donald rumsfeld coalition provisional authority paul bremer and british foreign secretary jack straw all publicly denied that the war was about oil but former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan wrote in his memoir that “i am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows the iraq war is largely about oil” and told the media that removing saddam was “essential” to secure world oil supplies former head of us operations in iraq general john abizaid said that “of course it’s about oil we can’t really deny that” and former defense secretary chuck hagel admitted in  that “people say we’re not fighting for oil of course we are”it is true that america even at the time did not consume a large portion of its oil from the middle east in  the us received most of its oil from domestic production plus sources in canada mexico and venezuela in this light invading iraq simply to “control” oil seems like a weak reason and most could easily predict that a hot war would damage iraq’s oil infrastructure creating long delays before production could get back up to speed but perhaps the war was not waged for oil in a general sense but specifically to defend the petrodollar systemin postinvasion may  weeks before iraq switched back to selling oil in dollars howard fineman wrote in newsweek that the europeans were debating the un over whether or not to continue searching for the wmds that they could not find he reported that the real dispute was not “about wmds at all its about something else entirely who gets to sell — and buy — iraqi oil and what form of currency will be used to denominate the value of the sales”as graeber asks “how much did hussein’s decision to buck the dollar really weigh into the us decision to depose him it’s impossible to say his decision to stop using ‘the enemy’s currency’ as he put it was one in a backandforth series of hostile gestures that likely would have led to war in any event what’s important here is that there were widespread rumors that this was one of the major contributing factors and therefore no policymaker in a position to make a similar switch can completely ignore the possibility much though their beneficiaries do not like to admit it all imperial arrangements do ultimately rest on terror”with hindsight the early  were an era when presented with the challenge of the euro it made sense for the us to take action and so whether or not the defense of the petrodollar was the main aim of the invasion of iraq the outcome was the same other countries saw what was done to saddam and were for many years careful about pushing their own “petro” currency and the oil iraq’s production more than doubled from  to  eventually climbing to five million barrels of oil per day the financial world has become multipolar over the past few years but as of  more than  of crude oil trade payments were still in dollarsiv dictators inequality and fossil fuelsbeyond the iraq war there are several other key and much more obvious negative externalities of the petrodollar system american support for the saudi dictatorship is one even though  of the  hijackers on  plus osama bin laden himself were saudi the us government has forcibly resisted any attempt to investigate the saudi regime for involvement in the attack and instead invaded and bombed other countries in retaliation the petrodollar is one of the primary reasons why the murderous house of saud is still in powerin  former us ambassador to saudi arabia chas freeman told congress “one of the major things the saudis have historically done in part out of friendship with the united states is to insist that oil continues to be priced in dollars therefore the us treasury can print money and buy oil which is an advantage no other country has” in  the saudis warned the us that it would drop the petrodollar system if they pursued the “nopec” congressional bill that would enable the justice department to pursue opec governments under antitrust laws for manipulating oil prices the bill was never enactedaccording to a  new york times story saudi arabia “told the obama administration and members of congress that it will sell off hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of american assets held by the kingdom if congress passes a bill that would allow the saudi government to be held responsible in american courts for any role in the sept   attacks”in  thenattorney general william barr prevented the name of a saudi diplomat linked to  from entering the public domain because such a disclosure risked “significant harm to the national security” in the wake of the murder of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi president donald trump would not push for action against mohamed bin salman on “nbc news” he said “i’m not like a fool that says ‘we don’t want to do business with them’” president biden has also refused to penalize mbs directly even though he has been presented with evidence from his own intelligence agencies showing that he ordered khashoggi’s murder saying it would be too costly for americathese are just a few examples of how despite the saudi regime’s bloody war in yemen its torture of female political prisoners and its assassination of khashoggi america’s relationship with the kingdom remains steadfast and protected at the highest levels according to research from the stockholm international peace research institute “between  and  the six gulf states bought more than onefifth of arms sold globally with saudi arabia the united arab emirates uae and qatar ranking as the world’s first eighth and tenth largest arms importers saudi arabia alone purchased onequarter of total us arms exports during that period up from  percent in –” the oil pricing pact first made in  remains strong in  despite very different timesdomestically certain factions of america have prospered because of the petrodollar but the impact on the median american has been negative as was recently written in “foreign affairs” “the benefits of dollar primacy accrue mainly to financial institutions and big businesses but the costs are generally borne by workers for this reason continued dollar hegemony threatens to deepen inequality as well as political polarization in the united states” corporations and asset owners have benefited most in the system’s lowinterest rate environment as feygin and leusder argue in “the class politics of the dollar system” “dollar primacy feeds a growing american trade deficit that shifts the country’s economy toward the accumulation of rents rather than the growth of productivity this has contributed to a falling labor and capital share of income and to the ballooning cost of services such as education medical care and rental housing”as the petrodollar system kept international demand for the dollar artificially strong throughout the decades america’s manufacturing base became weak and uncompetitive and lost jobs overseas normally a currency that is too strong ends up creating a deficit issue and is forced to devalue to sell exports but as investor lyn alden points out in “the fraying of the us global currency reserve system” that has never happened with the us due to the continual payment of its deficit by foreign nations in  the economist robert triffin identified this phenomenon now known as the triffin dilemma to remain the world’s reserve currency the us must provide global liquidity by running increasingly large deficits which one day must undermine faith in the dollarthe us financial sector has ballooned now accounting for  of gdp compared with  in  this financialization has enriched the assetholding elite on the coasts while ruining rust belt workers who deal with stagnant wages this has sparked populism and extreme inequality where the us average wealth is still relatively high among advanced nations but its median wealth is relatively low in this way alden and other macroeconomic thinkers like luke gromen argue that dollar hegemony actually hurts the us in its competition with nations like china which are able to continually borrow dollars to stockpile hard assets and consolidate control over important global supply chainsand then of course we have the petrodollar itself and its impact on the environment as reuters reported “if dollardenominated oil usage declines in favour of homeproduced wind solar or hydro energy sources then the swelling pool of global petrodollars recycled and invested by the world’s big oil producers since the end of the gold standard in the  may drain with it” simply put a global shift to renewables would put a big dent in the demand for fossil fuels which could deal a knockout blow to the petrodollar system and the ability for the us to run up massive deficits without consequences oil interests have aggressively resisted attempts to develop nuclear energy and renewables over the past few decades the us military continues to be the single largest consumer of petro resourceswhen the global reserve currency is literally reliant on the sale of oil the world has a massive carbon emissions problem not to mention the fact that as discussed the petrodollar is defended by the us military’s global presence which has a carbon output the size of a midsized nation is exaggerated in size by america’s need to protect the dollar and is boosted by the oil pricespiking wars it fights on various continents it is truly impossible for the petrodollar system to be green when it is based on black goldv bitcoin and a multipolar worldus foreign policy has kept the petrodollar dominant for many decades but its power is inarguably beginning to wane many americans including this author have been incredibly privileged by this system but it will not last foreverluke gromen calls the petrodollar system a “company town” where the us has enforced control over oil pricing with threats and violence after the fall of the soviet union he says america could have restructured the system and held another bretton woods but it held on to the unipolar moment beyond protecting the system against disruptions like the petroeuro gromen says that america extended the life of the system by launching nafta and helping china join the world trade organization in  these steps allowed the us to continue exporting manufacturing and treasuries abroad in exchange for goods and services he notes that in  china’s treasury holdings were  billion but rose to  trillion a decade later from  to  america’s biggest export was treasuries where foreign central banks bought  of the issuance using it as a new form of gold but since then china and other governments have been divesting treasuries and pushing us toward a new system in expectation of that gold losing value according to gromen they realized if dollars were still priced in oil as the us continued to run higher debttogdp ratios up from  in the  to more than  today the price of oil would eventually skyrocket europe was not able to disrupt the petrodollar system in the early  but over time the us’s hegemony and ability to stop other nations from pricing oil in their own currencies has erodedmore and more countries are denominating oil trade in other currencies like euros yuan and rubles partly because they fear reliance on a weakening system and partly because the us government continues to use the dollar as a weapon the american sanction system is incredibly powerful as it can cut enemies off from the swift payment network or from the world bank or imf as the financial times reported “by using american banks as a cudgel against russia joe biden has shown a willingness to weaponize the us financial system against foes continuing a tactic honed during the obama years and dramatically ramped up under donald trump”this month president biden publicly denounced the nord  pipeline project which would build on the momentum russian president vladimir putin already has with rosneft pricing more than  of the world’s oil in euros by connecting europe and russia team biden reportedly wants to “kill” the project and its officials have commented that dollar primacy remains “hugely important” to the administration and that “it’s in our national interest because of the funding cost advantage it provides  it allows us to absorb shocks… and gives us enormous geopolitical leverage” this is a striking indication of just how important the petrodollar system remains politically to the us  years after its creation despite critics who say the world uses dollars for pure market reasonsmany countries want to escape from us financial control and this desire is accelerating global dedollarization for example china and russia are as of last year transacting in dollars just  of the time versus just  seven years ago china is expanding oil trading denominated in yuan and many worry about the chinese communist party’s new “dcep” or digital yuan project being a ploy for increased international use of the yuan meanwhile former european commission president jeanclaude juncker has said “it is absurd that europe pays for  percent of its energy import bill — worth  billion euros a year — in us dollars when only roughly  percent of our energy imports come from the united states” while the dollar is still dominant trends point to other major currencies gaining traction in the coming yearsbeyond a shift to a multipolar currency world another threat to the petrodollar could be the sdr or “special drawing right” employed by the imf which is based on the dollar euro pound yen and yuan inspired by keynes and his failed bancor idea from bretton woods the sdr has achieved more traction in the past few years with more than  billion units in circulation and another  billion possibly being created but few governments in a position of economic power would willingly hand their monetary control over to an unelected alphabet soup organizationas for gold the world is not going back as jacques rueff wrote in the  “money managers in a democracy will always choose inflation only a gold standard deprives them of the option” the leftwing historian michael hudson explains that in the  he tried to make an apolitical case for the us government to revert to the gold standard teaming up with the rightwing scholar herman khan “he and i went down and gave a presentation to the us treasury saying ‘gold is a peaceful metal because it’s a constraint on the balance of payments if countries had to pay their balanceofpayments deficit in gold they would not be able to afford the balanceofpayments costs of going to war’ that was pretty much accepted and that was why the united states basically responded ‘that’s why we’re not going back to gold we want to be able to go to war and we want the only alternative to hold central bank reserves to be the united states dollar’” gold is by the account of most economists today simply too restrictivea  study in the journal of institutional economics posited four potential future monetary outcomes for the world continued dollar hegemony competing monetary blocs where the eu and china act as counterweights to the us an international monetary federation where at the top of the international hierarchy stands no longer a state but the bis and the sdr and international monetary anarchy where the world shrinks into less connected islands the authors however miss a fifth possibility a bitcoin standard where the digital currency becomes the global reserve assetsince its creation in  by satoshi nakamoto bitcoin has grown in value from less than a penny to more than  spreading to every major urban area on earth as a store of value and in some places a medium of exchange in the past year fortune  companies like tesla and sovereign wealth funds like singapore’s temasek have started to accumulate bitcoin on account of its inflationresistant properties many call it digital goldwe are very possibly witnessing the birth of not just a new ultimate store of value but also a new global base money neutral and decentralized like gold but unlike gold in that it is programmable teleportable easily verifiable absolutely scarce and resistant to centralized capture any citizen or any government can receive store or send any amount of bitcoin simply with internet access and no alliance or empire can debase that currency it is as some say the currency of enemies adversarial parties can use the system and benefit equally without detracting from each otheras bitcoin’s value goes up against fiat currencies more and more corporations and individuals will begin to accumulate eventually governments will too at first they will add it as a small part of their portfolio alongside other reserve currencies but eventually they will try to buy mine tax or confiscate as much as they canborn at a time when the previous world reserve currency had reached its apex bitcoin could introduce a new model with more possibilities but also more restraint anyone with an internet connection will be able to protect their wages and savings but governments unable to so easily create money on a whim will not be able to wage forever wars and build massive surveillance states that contradict the wishes of their citizens there could be a closer alignment between the rulers and the ruledthe big fear of course is that america will not be able to finance its exorbitant social programs and military spending if there is less global demand for the dollar if people prefer the euro or yuan or bonds from other countries the us in its current form would be in big trouble nixon and kissinger designed the petrodollar so that the us could benefit from global demand for dollars tied to oil the question is why can’t there be a global demand for dollars tied to bitcoinno matter the base money there could still be fiat currency and government debt priced according to the economic power and bitcoin position of those countries and in the emerging bitcoin world america is leading in many categories whether it is infrastructure software development actual holdings by the population and increasingly given current trends mining america is also built on liberty equality of opportunity free speech private property open capital markets and other values and institutions that bitcoin reinforces and reverberates if bitcoin did eventually become the global base money then america is in a position to capitalize on that transformationthis means no more reliance on dictators and secret pacts in the middle east no more need to threaten or invade other countries to preserve dollar primacy and no more opposing nuclear or renewable energy technology to protect the fossil fuel industry unlike the petrodollar system bitcoin could very well accelerate the global energy transition to renewables with miners always choosing the cheapest sources of electricity and trends pointing to cheaper renewables in the futureunder the bitcoin standard everyone would play by the same rules no government or alliance of governments can manipulate the monetary policy but any individual can opt into a nondiscretionary rulesbased currency and control a savings instrument that has historically appreciated versus goods and services this would be a dramatic net benefit for most people on earth especially when considering that billions today live under high inflation financial repression or economic isolationthis transition may not be so pleasant for authoritarian regimes which are more closed tyrannical violently redistributionist and isolated than liberal democracies but in this author’s view that would be a good thing and one that could force reforms where activism alone has failedthe world’s multipolar drift is inevitable no one country can in the near future gain as much power as america had at the end of the  century the us will still be a powerhouse for a long time to come but so will china the eu russia india and other nations and they may compete in a new monetary system that moves away from the petrodollar and all of its costly externalities a neutral bitcoin standard that plays to the strengths of open societies does not depend on dictators or fossil fuels and is ultimately run by citizens not the entrenched elitethis is a
