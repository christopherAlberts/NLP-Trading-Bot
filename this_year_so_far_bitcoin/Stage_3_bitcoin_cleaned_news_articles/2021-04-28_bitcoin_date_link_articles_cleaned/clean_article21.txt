dilutionproof april  on january   satoshi nakamoto launched the bitcoin network by mining the first block the “genesis block” in the bitcoin blockchain today a bit more than  years later the network stores over  trillion in value and transfers more than  billion in onchain volume on a daily basis to get there bitcoin went through multiple boom and bust cycles in which it was praised to the moon and declared dead many times over—every time to resurrect from the death this process kept repeating in a roughly fouryear cycle that led many to believe that there is a certain predictability to longterm bitcoin prices of which planb’s popular stocktoflow  model is the most wellknown attemptin this article we’ll first take an indepth look at why the bitcoin price moves in a fouryear cycle related to its halving schedule we then dive into how this market cycle influences more fundamental properties of the bitcoin network itself that are related to the behavior of miners and users finally i introduce a hypothesis for how the maturation of the bitcoin network itself will eventually extinguish its fouryear cycle and explain why this would be a good thing for the network and its usersbitcoin’s fixed supply issuance schedulewhen satoshi nakamoto launched the bitcoin network there was a need to  bring the bitcoin units into circulation and  incentivize early users to actually participate in the network by running their own mining nodes to secure the network and gradually decrease the chances of a single entity attacking the network via a majority attack or  attackto do this satoshi nakamoto decided on a coin issuance schedule where bitcoin network participants would receive a  mining reward also called “coinbase” not to be confused with the eponymous exchange per created block every  blocks  year assuming  blockintervals this reward halves after the first halving november   miners received  bitcoin after the second halving july    since the last halving may   they received  and so forthby combining this coin issuance schedule with adam back’s ingenious proofofwork mechanism bitcoin’s monetary policy regarding its supply figure  blue line and monetary inflation figure  orange line became set in stone on a perblock basis as soon as the network launched—unlike its central bank predecessorsfigure  the bitcoin supply blue and monetary inflation orange over time sourceimpact of the halving on supply demand and priceintended or not the roughly fouryear halving that has occurred three times in bitcoin’s existence so far appears to have been a consistent trigger in pushing up the price every time as can be seen in figure  after every halving event white striped vertical lines the bitcoin price white line has moved up dramatically in the year after those events the average bitcoin price during a fouryear moving window black line in figure  has been positive during its complete lifespan as a resultfigure  a logarithmic chart with the bitcoin price in usd and its fouryear moving averagebefore each halving event the bitcoin price is a dynamic equilibrium betweenthe supply of newly mined bitcoin that enters the market the demand for bitcoin by new market participants and recurring purchases the degree in which that new demand comes from longterm hodlers that take the respective bitcoin off the market and the degree in which increased market prices or other triggers entice existing longterm hodlers to increase the supply available on the market by selling bitcoinafter the halving the supply of newly mined bitcoin that enters the market is cut in half if the demand for bitcoin remains unchanged this means that a supply shortage is gradually formed since bitcoin’s supply is perfectly inelastic this supply shortage cannot be solved by creating more bitcoin as a result the only way for the market to unlock supply to satisfy the demand for bitcoin is to entice current holders to sell their bitcoin—which means that the market price has to move up due to bitcoin’s status as a veblen good this rising price tends to attract even more demand exacerbating the already existing supply shortage and driving up the price much faster than it organically would those price developments resulted in a temporary bubble each time that ended with a market crash and subsequent multimonth to multiyear bear market that was necessary for supply and demand to find a new equilibrium—each time at a much higher level than during the previous cyclethis mechanism was brilliantly visualized by croesusbtc in this tweet thread and is compiled in figure figure  a visualization by croesusbtc of how the halving creates a supply shock that drives up prices sourcealthough the posthalving price increases the bitcoin price charts are already pretty distinct and the causal mechanism for such a cycle to exist is quite selfevident it is nice to get more robust evidence for the notion that the bitcoin price indeed moves in a fouryear cycle in this published article on april   btconometrics performed a fourier analysis to prove that this is indeed the case although the statistical methods used are relatively complicated and explaining them is beyond the scope of this article the graphical representation of the results is actually straightforward to interpret as can be seen in figure  the highest values are reached very close to the red line that represents the fouryear cycle illustrating that the cyclicality in bitcoin is indeed very close to thatfigure  the results of a fourier analysis performed by btconometrics visually proving that the bitcoin price indeed moves in roughly fouryear cyclessourcethe bitcoin price temperature bptnow that we have insight into the mechanism that is driving bitcoin’s fouryear cycles we can take a more indepth look at what this price cyclicality looks like to do so i have created a metric called the bitcoin price temperature bpt which is described in detail herein short the bpt is calculated by subtracting every daily closing price by the average bitcoin price during the previous four years and then dividing that number by the price’s standard deviation during that time span the result is a metric that reflects to what extent any historic bitcoin price deviates from its fouryear moving average while taking its volatility into account and thus how “hot” or “cold” the price is—hence the name bitcoin price temperature by utilizing the bitcoin price’s standard deviation into the metric the bpt metric adjusts for price volatility unlike otherwise similar indicators like the mayer multiplethe top chart in figure  illustrates the bpt as shown the bitcoin price has actually rarely been below its fouryear moving average the blue horizontal line at zero and it has historically reached its fouryear cycle tops at a price temperature of eight or higher on a smaller time frame the bitcoin price has also changed its bullish or bearish trajectory several times at temperatures of around two and six while these levels have been determined based on a limited sample and thus need to be taken with a grain of salt they are interesting price levels to monitor during bitcoin’s current and future fouryear cycles—assuming those will continue to be similar to the past cycles which will be discussed later in this articlefigure  the bitcoin price temperature bpt chart  and full bitcoin price history with bpt bands overlay another way to look at the cyclicality of the bpt and bitcoin price itself is to “reset the clock” at every halving creating a chart where the bpt andor bitcoin price itself per cycle are overlaid making them easier to compare as can be seen in the top chart in figure  the price temperature gradually moves up after the halving at an increasing pace historically creating a blowoff top circa  to  months after the halving taking the remainder of the fouryear cycle to cool off again and find an equilibrium somewhere around its fouryear moving averagethe bottom chart in figure  illustrates the actual bitcoin price in united states dollars usd with an overlay of the bpt and bpt bands every time the price temperature reaches the cooldown period of its fouryear cycle the bitcoin price has found an equilibrium at a price level that is at least an order of magnitude higher than the previous cyclefigure  the bpt top and bpt bands per halving cycle bottomthis is also why dollarcost averaging dca into bitcoin and hodling it for the long haul or at least four years has historically been such an effective strategy it doesn’t matter if you have bought the top or the bottom as long as you have held onto your bitcoin for at least four years you’ve historically done very well—without the additional costs of time anxiety and in some countries like the united states tax burdens that come with active tradingimpact of the market cycle on bitcoin’s hash rate and coin issuancein anticipation of each bitcoin halving articles spreading fear uncertainty and doubt fud about something called ‘the mining death spiral’ start appearing the mining death spiral fud suggests that since the block subsidy is split in half miners are faced with a  cut in their profitability which will cause some of them to stop mining in turn this would make the network less secure making it less valuable making the price go down further decreasing miner profitability making them turn off more miners and so forthwhile it is true that in the shortterm some miners are turning off hardware that is less efficient or running on more expensive energy that dip is barely visible on longterm charts and ensures that the remaining mining activity on the network is actually very efficient and healthy more importantly that temporary dip is actually completely undone by the positive side effects of the halvinginduced price increase that was described earlieras a result of the increasing bitcoin price following the halvinginduced supply shortage mining profitability increases again incentivizing miners to rejoin the network as a result the network’s hash rate actually increases making the network more secure and thus more valuable this means that on a multiyear horizon we are actually seeing the complete opposite of what the mining death spiral fud suggests will happen—all thanks to bitcoin’s fouryear cyclein figure  the almost continuously increasing hash rate of the bitcoin network is illustrated as can be seen the hash rate barely drops after each halving white striped vertical lines and as the bitcoin price and thus the bpt measure that we introduced in the previous paragraph increases hash rate growth accelerates during the second half of the cycle when price is cooling down hash rate growth stagnates a bit—until the next halving occurs and a new market cycle incentivizes more rapid growth of this network characteristic that is so important for its overall security actually making the network itself more valuablefigure  the bitcoin hash rate overlaid with the bitcoin price temperature bptto ensure that new blocks are created every  minutes which is necessary to make the network relatively stable to transact on and that the supply issuance is actually spread out over time the network has a builtin difficulty adjustment mechanism every  blocks which is every  days the network makes it a bit easier to mine if the hash rate on the network is relatively low or a bit more difficult to mine if the hash rate on the network is relatively highthis means that during these periods of the cycle where the hash rate keeps going up more new bitcoins are created than would be expected based on the original supply issuance schedule that assumes  block times this inspired david puell to explore the ratio of the daily coin issuance and the average daily coin issuance over the past year which resulted in the puell multiplethe puell multiple is displayed in figure  along with several levels that appear interesting based on visual inspection which is subjective and should thus be taken with a grain of salt as can be seen the daily coin issuance takes an abrupt decline on the day of each halving which is due to the halving of the block subsidy in the months after as price increases mining becomes more profitable a new hash rate floods onto the network and the daily coin issuance ramps up again when the bitcoin price growth stops and the market cycle finishes with a blowoff top that is followed by a cooldown period mining profitability decreases causing the daily coin issuance to go down again the puell multiple is therefore regularly seen as an interesting indicator to monitor bitcoin’s cyclicality from an onchain perspectivefigure  the puell multiple a metric that quantifies to what extent the daily coin issuance is increased in comparison to the average daily coin issuance over the previous yearbesides the hash rate growth and resulting temporary increase in daily coin issuance that are particularly indicative of cyclical miner behavior the bitcoin blockchain holds valuable information regarding another important group of market participants those that use bitcoin to transact onchaininfluence of the market cycle on the mempool and transaction feesintuitively the first thing that you might think of to visualize the behavior of that group might be to create a chart of the number of daily transactions if we were to do so we would indeed see an overall trend that as time passes more transactions are made on a daily basis but as the bitcoin network matures that growth stagnates that stagnation can be easily explained a bitcoin block can only include a certain amount of transactions so the metric wouldn’t be an ideal proxy for how crowded it actually is on the network what happens when most or all of the newly created blocks are full is that the number of transactions that are cued up increases in bitcoin this cue is called a “mempool” which is visualized in figure  as is evident based on that figure the number of transactions that are waiting to be included in the blockchain have increased rapidly after breaking the alltime high price of  in december figure  the bitcoin mempool size over the last year april – according to mempoolspacesourcethe mempool is currently in a state where it hasn’t cleared in approximately five months which means that when any miner created a new block during that time span they had plenty of unconfirmed transactions to include in the block a logical conclusion is that miners are financially incentivized to include the unconfirmed transactions that are offering the highest transaction fee to reward the miner for including their transaction which is indeed how most of the current miners operateas a result unconfirmed transactions with a high transaction fee are included in new blocks first while transactions with a low fee remain stuck in the mempool longer this is visible in figure  where the mempool is currently particularly filled with unconfirmed transactions that pay a fee of  satoshis per vbyte while the mempool is regularly cleared from transactions of a higher fee ratean implication of this mechanism is that during busy times on the network anyone that is looking to make an onchain transaction on the network needs to bid up their transaction fee to get their tiny share of block space on the bitcoin blockchain that is needed to get their transaction confirmed as such a block space market sometimes called “fee market” which is technically incorrect because the block space on the bitcoin blockchain is being bid on developssince the value of the transaction fees that are included in bitcoin blocks essentially represents the magnitude of this developing block space market it is a better proxy for network activity than simply looking at transaction counts figure  visualizes the average bitcoin transaction fees in united states dollars usd over time overlaid by the bpt metric that we introduced before in anticipation of each halving the average transaction fee is already gradually increasing but its growth particularly accelerates when the bitcoin price increases after each halving after the market cycle reaches a blowoff top and prices start to cool down again network activity decreases again and finds a new equilibrium when the overall bitcoin market cycle bottoms outfigure  the average bitcoin transaction fees in united states dollars usd overlaid with the bitcoin price temperature bptbesides the cyclicality a clear increasing trend in the average bitcoin transaction fees can be observed in figure  while this may seem like a bad thing don’t we all prefer to pay less for transacting this is actually of the utmost importance for bitcoin’s longterm existence after all if the block subsidy declines every four years and at some point in the future disappears altogether miners still need an incentive to keep mining and process transactionsthe contribution of transaction fees to the block rewardfigure  visualizes the percentage in which transaction fees red and the block subsidy blue account for the overall block reward that miners receive when creating a block when first glancing at these percentages on a continuous scale top figure it seems like transaction fees are relatively irrelevant as the block subsidy has accounted for the vast majority of the block reward during all of bitcoin’s history while this is true when these percentages are displayed on a logarithmic scale bottom figure  it becomes more apparent that over time there is actually a clear upward trend in the degree to which transaction fees play a role in the block reward on a cyclebycycle basis you can even see that the percentage increases by roughly an order of magnitude underlining how large this growth actually isfigure  transaction fees and block subsidy as a percentage of the block reward over time on a continuous top and logarithmic scale bottomwhile it is difficult to predict exactly when the point will be reached where transaction fees will consistently account for the majority of the block reward based on eyeballing the charts above perhaps after one to three more cycles as long as there is at least some activity on the bitcoin network it is a given that this point will be reached at some point in the future because the block subsidy trends toward zero by designwhen this point is reached there is one more incredibly important question that we’ll get an answer on will the hash rate on the network stay relatively stable at a level that is sufficient to guarantee the network’s overall security if the answer to that question is “yes” bitcoin will have passed the biggest test in its existence and have passed the final exam toward its full maturity perhaps it could even be the point where the bitcoin core software versioning is upgraded toward  and above while we cannot establish with absolute certainty that the question above can ultimately be answered with “yes” a case can be made to be optimistic about the outcome as was done by dan held in this may  articlethis brings us to the final part of this article where we’ll hypothesize how that perspective would impact the fouryear cycle and what that future for bitcoin would look likehow a healthy block space market will kill the fouryear cyclethe subtitle of this article already gave away the direction of my take on this when bitcoin gets to the “full maturity” mentioned above and a healthy block space market exists that is able to sufficiently incentivize miners to structurally keep the lights on i expect the fouryear cycles as we know them today to fade into oblivionthe easiest way to substantiate this claim is to fastforward all the way to the late  when bitcoin’s block subsidy is estimated to run out in the absence of a block subsidy  of the new demand for bitcoin will have to be satisfied by purchasing bitcoin from existing holders and to some extent miners that sell some of their fee revenue to pay for expenses which will likely be just a fraction of the total supply that is available for sale on the market creating a perfectly inelastic situation where price changes become a perfect reflection of changes in demand for bitcoin to visualize this end state croesusbtc’s visualization of the demandsupply mechanic has been adjusted to this new situation in figure figure  croesusbtcs visualization of the supplydemand mechanism in bitcoin updated for the scenario in which the block subsidy has run outsourcenow that we have established that the halving cycles will by design end at some point during the next  years it is helpful to rewind to the present and assess what the shortterm path toward that end state will look like in the near futureto understand those implications it is important to grok that the relative impact of each halving on the block subsidy is the same block subsidy divided by two but the absolute impact of each halving on the block subsidy decreases over time for example the fourthannual inflation rate dropped by  in  but then by  in   in  and will drop by just  in   in  and  in  more simply put the larger the percentage of bitcoin’s finite supply has already been issued the smaller the impact of a change in the remaining issuance rate on the supply that is already circulating on the marketnow that we have established that the block subsidy is literally designed to decay into oblivion over time the final step is to understand when the halving of the block subsidy will indeed start to lose its relevancethe way i see it this probably won’t be attributable to a single point in time but it will be a gradual process that will happen when transaction fees overtake the block subsidy as the primary source of miner revenue figure  after all the smaller the contribution of the block subsidy to the portion of the miner revenue becomes the smaller the impact of halvings will be on the supply that is available for sale on the marketfigure  when transaction fees overtake the block subsidy as the primary source of miner revenue the effect of the halvings on bitcoins fouryear market cycle can be expected to decayhow the death of the fouryear cycle will impact bitcoin’s futurewhen the earlier described process has progressed to a point where transaction fees have become the primary source of miner revenue and the fouryear cycle has indeed decayed into irrelevance it will impact bitcoin’s future in several waysfirst the decay of the fouryear cycle would mean that pricing models that depend on the assumption of a halvingrelated market cycle being present will lose accuracy and at some point break this would apply to the bitcoin price temperature bpt and bpt bands that were discussed earlier but also for the popular  and  models the big question regarding the latter would those models break to the downside eg via diminishing returns as longterm volatility declines or to the upside eg via a steepening adoption curve andor hyperinflationlike eventsecond as the percentage of bitcoin’s finite supply that has already been issued increases the bitcoin price becomes an increasingly pure reflection of the market demand for bitcoin this means that in a longterm posthalvingcycle future cyclicality in bitcoin will likely be more closely related to the actual economic activity of its market participants and thus their economic cycle sometimes also called “business cycle”third if the bitcoin price increasingly becomes a pure reflection of the market demand for bitcoin the likelihood of a dramatic exponential price rise past what we have seen so far increases after all due to the everdecreasing supply issuance rate demand for bitcoin has an increasingly direct influence on the bitcoin price with gold large increases in demand can be answered by increasing the supply rate via additional mining but this is not possible in bitcoin—making it the ultimate hard money if bitcoin were to reach mass adoption and follow a similar technology adoption curve to what we’ve seen in the use of the internet or mobile phones figure  the likelihood of a “supercycle” happening in the bitcoin price increases or a mixture between that and its traditional fouryear cycle as a more fluid transformation something similar to this has also been described by croesusbtc in a june  twitter threadfigure  dr everett rogers’  diffusion of innovations theorysourcefourth another consequence of the absence of a fouryear cycle as we know it could mean that the bitcoin price eventually becomes less volatile as was recently pointed out in a note by jp morgan that development would be a positive for institutional interest in the asset which would further validate it as a macro store of valuefinally if a healthy block space market will indeed kill bitcoin’s fouryear cycle it means that transacting on the bitcoin blockchain will likely have become quite expensive this means that in the future most of us won’t be transacting via the bitcoin base layer on a regular basis more likely the block space fee pressure will incentivize more effective batching of transactions or as nic carter put it during baltic honeybadger  “container ships not parcels” and broader adoption of layers eg the lightning network that have been built on top of bitcoin’s base layer which most of us will probably primarily use to interact with bitcoin aside from occasional channel opens or closes or large transactionsspecial thanks go out to geertjancap for the useful feedback on the draft of this article follow dilutionproof on twitter for continued discussion on this topic disclaimer
