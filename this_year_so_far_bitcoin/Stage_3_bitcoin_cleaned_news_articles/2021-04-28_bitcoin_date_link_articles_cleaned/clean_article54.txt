credit dreamstimea new emerging cryptocurrency chia could do to the hard drive and ssd market what more traditional cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum have done to gpus spike prices and make them nexttoimpossible to buy in asia the trend has reportedly already begunchia isn’t just another knockoff cryptocurrency it’s led by the founder of bittorrent bram cohen who is chief executive of the chia project chia began allowing chia “farmers” to begin mining chia coins in march and will allow transactions of the coins themselves to begin on may traditional cryptocurrencies use what’s called “proof of work” to authenticate blockchain transactions with progressively decreasing rewards as more coins are mined in reality this means that cryptocurrency miners have moved to cpus to gpus and even specialised asics to mine crypto as quickly and efficiently as possiblebut because specialised asics are impossible for consumers to design and manufacture demand for more available gpus has skyrocketed driving up prices hundreds of dollars above msrpchia uses “proof of time and space” to achieve similar goals but with storage according to chia users of the chia blockchain will “seed” unused space on their harddisk drive or ssd by installing software which stores a collection of cryptographic numbers on the disk as “plots”using the chia software users then scan the blocks to see what hash is closest to the cryptographic challenge then pass the result off to a separate server known as a “timelord”all this means is that chia put your surplus storage space to work rather than your gpu according to the chianet plotting basics page chia farmers will want to prioritise both storage size and storage speed—which means the technology will prioritise the largest fastest ssds especially those that use the nvme interfacehowever chia doesn’t recommend running the software on your pc’s boot drive because of the wearing effect all of the calculations will have on your pcinstead the reference chia hardware posted to github prioritises external storage above all else with racks of traditional hard drives or ssds stored in a nas or other arrangement the goal chia says is to maximise the number of terabytes with minimal power consumption a discrete gpu isn’t even listed among the suggested parts its tacit encouragement to snap up whatever hard drives and ssds you canstorage price spikes may have already begunwill hard drives and ssds begin disappearing as more farmers begin farming chia unfortunately some reports say it’s already happening the good news at least for everyday users is that chia farmers seem to be bypassing consumer drives for enterprisegrade hardware whose capacity and speed offer the greatest mining potentialin china the south china morning post cited officials at taobao online stores and jdcom reporting that most enterprisegrade drives with over  storage are sold out the post also reported that the price of a wd  drive had spiked from  yuan about  in february before surging on april  to  yuan about  on jdcom a  increaseso far the effects haven’t been felt that profoundly in the american market according to pcpartpickercom the price of sataconnected ssds has nearly doubled especially in the low end but prices of higherend  ssds have remained relatively fixed throughout the past year prices of enterpriseclass storage appear to be relatively stable at online stores like amazon tooit’s enough to make enthusiast stomachs get fluttery though while it’s neat for nas racks to be used for more than just video and network backups the scarcity of gpus has thwarted pc upgrades and new builds for many if chia makes highend ssds a scarce commodity too pc building will become even more frustrating
