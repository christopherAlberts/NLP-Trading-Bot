the bitcoin optech newsletter provides readers with a toplevel summary of the most important technical news happening in bitcoin along with resources that help them learn more to help our readers stay uptodate with bitcoin were republishing the latest issue of this newsletter below remember to subscribe to receive this content straight to your inboxthis week’s newsletter describes a draft specification for ln splicing announces a workshop about transaction relay security announces the addition of ecdsa signature adaptor support to  and links to proposals to change the bips process also included are our regular sections with summaries of popular questions and answers from the bitcoin stackexchange announcements of software releases and release candidates and descriptions of notable changes to popular bitcoin infrastructure softwarenewsdraft specification for ln splicing rusty russell opened a pr to the lightning specifications repository “bolts” proposing the protocol changes necessary to accommodate splicing he also posted a link for the pr to the lightningdev mailing list splicing will allow transferring funds from onchain outputs into an existing payment channel or from an existing payment channel to independent onchain outputs without the channel participants having to wait for a confirmation delay to spend the channel’s other funds this helps wallets hide from their users the technical details of managing balances for example alice’s wallet can automatically pay bob offchain or onchain from the same payment channel—offchain using ln through that payment channel or onchain using a splice out withdrawal from that payment channelrussell previously proposed a draft specification for splicing in  see newsletter  but this new draft has the advantage of being able to use the interactive funding protocol that’s included as part of clightning’s experimental support for dual fundingrussell previously proposed a draft specification for splicing in  see

layercrossing workshop antoine riard posted to both the bitcoindev and lightningdev mailing lists about an upcoming ircbased workshop he plans to host to discuss challenges with onchain transaction relay that affect layertwo protocols such as ln the goal is to build technical consensus among the participants about which proposals are especially worth perusing so that developers and reviewers can focus on those proposals in the short termthe post proposes an agenda that includes package relay fee sponsorship see newsletter  moving from  optin replace by fee rbf to full rbf improving coordination of security response between primarily onchain projects such as full nodes and primarily offchain projects like ln nodes and defining what mempool and relay policies can be reasonably depended upon by layer two protocols riard also asks for additional topic suggestions from anyone planning to attend with may  being the deadline for submissions the workshop will likely be held mid

also asks for additional topic suggestions from anyone planning to attend with may  being the deadline for submissions the workshop will likely be held mid june support for ecdsa signature adaptors added to  signature adaptors were originally described for bitcoin by andrew poelstra using schnorrbased multisignatures this allows a single signature to do up to three things at once  prove its creator had access to a certain private key  prove knowledge of an encryption key preselected by another party  reveal a preselected encryption key to another party this allows a signature alone to do many of the things we currently do with bitcoin scripts suggesting adaptor signatures could be used to create “scriptless scripts”accomplishing the same on ecdsa is not as easy however lloyd fournier suggested it would be relatively simple if we separated goal  proof of private key from goals  and  proving and revealing encryption keys aka adaptors this requires using one signature object as just a signature and another signature object for the adaptors so it uses opcheckmultisig and is not quite as scriptless as before the separated construction also requires a security warning related to reusing some of the involved keys with elliptic curve diffie hellman ecdh key exchange and elgamal encryption beyond that this technique makes signature adaptors entirely usable on bitcoin today and it’s what various dlc projects have been usingin april  jonas nick implemented support for these simplified ecdsa signature adaptors in a draft pr see newsletter  jesse posner ported and extended the pr to  a fork of  that supports more advanced cryptographic protocols this updated pr has now been merged after a detailed review process that involved several conversations that may be of interest to

signature adaptors problems with the bips process after some drama on the bips repository and perhaps some previous pentup frustrations several discussions were started on the mailing list about adding a new bips editor using a bot to merge bips prs or abandoning the centralized bips repository altogetherselected qa from bitcoin stackexchangebitcoin stackexchange is one of the first places optech contributors look for answers to their questions—or when we have a few spare moments to help curious or confused users in this monthly feature we highlight some of the topvoted questions and answers posted since our last updatewhat are the different contexts where mtp is used in bitcoin david a harding defines median time past mtp and outlines how mtp is used todetermine the validity of a block using its ntime field controlling difficulty adjustment period times ensure that time only moves forward simplifying state transitions in  eliminate the incentive for individual miners to confirm transactions with locktimes up to two hours in the future by lying about the current time as fixed in why does the mined block differ so much from the block template user andy asks why block  differs from what his getblocktemplate rpc had output around the same time that block was mined andrew chow and murch point out asicboost as the reason the version field is different while nodeindependent mempools and node uptime are considerations of the block’s transaction discrepanciesisn’t bitcoin’s hash target supposed to be a power of  andrew chow explains the ‘leading zeros’ explanation of difficulty targeting is an oversimplification and chytrik gives an example of a valid and invalid hash with the same number of leading zerosreleases and release candidatesnew releases and release candidates for popular bitcoin infrastructure projects please consider upgrading to new releases or helping to test release candidatesbitcoin core  is a release candidate for a version of bitcoin core that contains activation logic for the proposed taproot soft fork taproot uses schnorr signatures and allows the use of tapscript these are respectively specified by bips   and  also included is the ability to pay  addresses specified by  although bitcoins spent to such addresses on mainnet will not be secure until activation of a soft fork using such addresses such as taproot the
