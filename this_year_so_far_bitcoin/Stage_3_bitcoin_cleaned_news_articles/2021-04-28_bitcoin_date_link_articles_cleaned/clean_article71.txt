many crypto assets have increased in price substantially in the last  months bitcoin alone is up over  as the value of many crypto assets is climbing they account for a larger proportion of investors’ portfolios and it’s as important as ever to think about how to keep your crypto safe“it’s important that the public is educated about crypto security” says farzam ehsani cofounder and ceo of crypto exchange valrcom“given the security breaches on various crypto platforms recently it’s an opportune time to ask some searching questions about the security of local crypto exchanges and what customers should look for”just as the crypto industry has been gaining traction with traditional investors regulators and even institutions several highprofile security breaches have garnered media attentionjust last week bloomberg reported that the founder of turkish exchange thodex faruk fatih ozer had absconded to albania with  billion worth of customers’ crypto and is currently evading an international arrest warrantcloser to home the exposure of mirror trading international mti’s fraudulent practices saw the organisation’s kingpin johannes steynberg reportedly flee south africa in december together with an estimated   bitcoin he managed to collect from victims of his schemethe closure of  one of the oldest south african exchanges left customers unable to withdraw their funds and is one more example of south africans being left unable to access their crypto holdingsmoneyweb readers are understandably concerned at the number of breaches of trust around the crypto space“these concerns are valid and every crypto investor should ensure that they are using a crypto exchange that is safe and secure” cautions ehsani“when you buy bitcoin on an exchange like valr and leave it on the platform you entrust the exchange to secure your funds as it holds the private keys of all customer funds this doesn’t come cheap for example at valr we have a dedicated cybersecurity team and have made significant investment to do everything we can to keep customer funds safe”the main risksehsani adds that there are two main risks one carries when holding crypto assets on exchangesexchanges that do not secure customers’ funds comprehensively can be prone to security breaches unscrupulous owners could shut down the exchange and steal the assets also known as an ‘exit scam’ehsani empathises with investors’ concerns continuing “both are real risks that have materialised at various exchanges around the world in the last decade you could say ‘forget that i’m taking my crypto off the exchange’ your choice is then to withdraw your crypto to a wallet of your own where you hold the private key this could be a hardware software or paper wallet”while holding your own private keys is an option for crypto holders taking this kind of responsibility bears its own risks – if you’re not careful or don’t have the knowhow your private key may be lost or compromisedmuch like a physical key to a vault nothing can be done to access your crypto assets without your private key if you lose your key your funds would be lost permanentlyit’s evident that both options – keeping crypto on an exchange versus managing your own private keys in your own “selfcustody” wallet – carry their own potential risksehsani urges investors to think carefully about which approach is more suitable for them explaining “some say exchanges are honey pots that attract attackers as they hold large sums and therefore the risk is higher but is this risk higher than you losing or mismanaging your private key or your key getting compromised only you can answer that”exchange security proceduresvalr holds clients’ cryptocurrencies in both “cold storage” and “hot wallets” cold storage refers to offline institutional vaults that are geographicallydispersed accesscontrolled and videomonitored hot wallets are online multisignature wallets required to maintain operational liquidity in addition all customers’ zar funds are held in segregated accounts for added protectionvalr’s security procedures do not allow any individual including the ceo to transfer cryptocurrencies

account from any new device or location will likewise have to input the  code“there is an incredible amount of security that goes into running an exchange and customers are right to want to know whether their crypto is safe we’ve invested large sums of money to make sure we have security and custody that matches the best in the world” says ehsaniwhy valrapart from the highlevel security it
