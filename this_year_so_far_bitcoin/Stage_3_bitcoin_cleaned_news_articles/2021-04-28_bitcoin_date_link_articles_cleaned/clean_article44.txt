we have seen a big uptick in the hype surrounding bitcoin driven largely by the massive returns reported recent bloomberg research contrasted the rise in bitcoin with market bubbles like the tech market crash in the late nineties but there is almost no comparison tech stocks rose just more than  over the entire course of their bubble and bitcoin is already up by almost   returns have been strong but does bitcoin have a role to play in wealth managementthere are some immediate challenges with this cryptocurrency to consider firstly bitcoin is not approved by the financial sector conduct authority fsca as a financial product because bitcoin operates without a central authority such as a central bank there is no clear recourse if things go wrongthe fsca recently issued two “health warnings” to investors as cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used in scams for example mirror trading international mti has been named as the biggest crypto scam of  through which  of investors’ bitcoin was stolenshould bitcoin play a role in your financial planyour financial plan links your goals to the investments and investment returns you require to achieve those goals your financial plan also ensures that you understand the risks inherent in any investments and that you are comfortable with the possibility of not achieving your goals should those risks materialisecurrencies are usually considered as investment vehicles not investments an accurate assessment of an investment’s intrinsic value requires a linked cashflow stream this cashflow stream then needs to be discounted and valued to determine whether the asset is trading at a value under or above its intrinsic value without this assessment we would contend that any allocation is highly speculativebitcoins have been subject to sharp and rapid changes in value rendering their value worth unpredictable at any given time there are no specific licensing requirements for wealth managers and credible research is thin which means risks are largely unknown and not actively monitored with unpredictable risk comes real uncertainty about an investor’s ability to ultimately meet their financial planning goalsfraud theft and liquidity risksbitcoin holds appeal for people engaged in illegal activities because of its anonymity this combined with a rise in digital crime introduces the risk of fraud and theft this is exactly what happened in february  when mt gox filed for bankruptcy protection mt gox the world’s cryptocurrency exchange which at one point controlled  of bitcoin transactions was plagued with hacks and other problems it finally closed down in the currency is managed by peertopeer technology that is responsible for all functions including issuance transaction processing and verification as a peertopeer vehicle it bypasses financial institutions as intermediaries it may be cheaper to use but this removes the safety net provided by financial institutions and the regulations that govern their oversight functionscryptocurrency issuance is very tightly held with  of all supply being held anonymously by fewer than  of the owners this may pose liquidity problems during a currency crisis or when a financial plan must deliver on emergency funding for unforeseen needs its commitment to a limited production of  bitcoins is fundamental to its objective of retaining value although it must be noted that this commitment is not contractual and there is no clear recourse indicated should the currency be devalued or more bitcoins minedwill bitcoin ever be appropriate in the wealth management spacethe fsca warns investors who would like to invest in unregulated risky assets such as cryptocurrency that “if it is too good to be true then it usually is” this summarises our current position on bitcoinwe will reconsider this view when credible research and regulatory oversight is commonplace and when wealth managers can be appropriately licensed and accredited we would also like to see a central authority taking responsibility for ongoing oversight and illegal activity through bitcoin being traced back to specific accountable partiesthese measures would help investors to understand the risks well enough to assess whether they are acceptable in the context of a goalbased financial plan
