the fundamental notions of “bull” and “bear” trends originating from the stock exchange have penetrated the cryptocurrency market and represent the tactics of animal attacks in wild nature should you ever confuse the terms you only need to remember that bears wave their paws and halt to fight while bulls lift up their horns and simply run forward so crypto bears trade for a fall and crypto bulls aim at an exchange rate growtha trend accordingly is a continuously repeated tendency of price changes in the financial market this is especially relevant for the cryptocurrency industry most susceptible to global events which can cardinally change it take for instance the chinese trends in the recent weeks the mood in the celestial empire has been quite low as the bitcoin search queries

of time although predicting trends is actually quite hard the key persistent driver for new bull trends is the increasing acceptance of bitcoin and other coins as a payment instrument and investment assets and usage of blockchain technologies and applications in new business domains legislative and tax changes to which the market responds immediately are also importantbest behavior for beginner
