of my parents to a certain extent a lot of my speaking skills ability to negotiate and connect disparate thoughts and disparate humans diplomatic consensusbuilding skills my ability to work with the government love for travel and tenacity i learnt from them”contrasting her timid personality she always wanted to travel the world — but not as an air hostess or an ambassador a diplomatic position was what she wantedalways wanting to arbitrate — help people understand each other and be the connection between them — she earned herself the nickname voltron defender of the universeand like superheroes with secret identities the extrovert within comes out only when necessary“i cannot abide to see around me any form of oppression or anyone being cheated” she says

a side hustle“i’m a firm believer that there are so many giftings in each of us that will play out at some point in life it’s okay to have a spectrum of what you can do and i understand the concept of helping people to focus on their career” she addsand she has consistently worked on this for the last two decadesin the years leading up to her graduation from obafemi awolowo university in  when she

she accepted some volunteering opportunities to upskill young people in technology online and offline“volunteering formed the basis of my career there’s a joy and opportunity that comes with giving people the gift of my time” she proudly submitsshe noticed that training others was not enough and so she decided to fill a gap she saw inadequate government policies and regulations to support
