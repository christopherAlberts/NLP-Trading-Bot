by jeremy schwartz cfa global head of research will peck head of strategy  emerging technologiesbitcoin is a hot topic we had the pleasure of discussing the investment thesis for bitcoin on our behind the markets podcast with ari paul the cofounder of blocktower capital a crypto assetfocused asset management firmprior to entering crypto paul worked as an options and commodity trader at susquehanna and then as a portfolio manager for the university of chicago’s endowment his endowment looked for new markets in which professionals still were largely absent when he entered crypto in  paul says that was the case he would even argue today that “investment professionals” are still not meaningfully involvedpaul sees tremendous risk in crypto assets yet he sees these risks as idiosyncratic uncorrelated risk that diversifies a portfolio and provides alpha potentialhave endowments allocated yetpaul believes  of the  largest endowments in the us have direct holdings and – have invested into crypto funds paul hasn’t pitched endowments because he thinks that it’s such a fastmoving space endowments will take a long time to come around this could be a further catalyst of new demand for crypto assetshistory of economic and technology cyclespaul draws parallels from the railroads in the  early computers in the  and the internet in the —and how adoption trends follow similar patterns there is a cycle known as the gartner hype cycle in which everyone views a technology as worldchanging but gets the speed of adoption wrongin  everyone thought everything would be bought over the internet and all our interactions would occur online—which was correct but it would take  years and a pandemic for this view to become reality there was no infrastructure in ’ we were all on dialup modems while less than  of the world had internet access and online credit card payments were difficult and not trustedpaul offers an analogy email came out in  it took  years before the world wide web’s release and another  years before real scale came to bothbitcoin was launched in  and is like email ethereum is like the world wide web—it came five years after bitcoin but it took about three years before real transaction volume occurred therebut in the last  months decentralized finance defi has taken off uniswap a “decentralized exchange” does  billion in transactions daily there is also a budding art market referred to as nfts nonfungible tokens and one standout is top shot an official nba collectible market which did  million of transactions in its first two monthspaul thinks defi will do insanely well over the next few years but then there will be a rude awakening as to how long it will take for certain elements to play out leading to a large drop in defi asset pricesbitcoin as a medium of exchangewe also discussed use cases for bitcoin bitcoin is both a protocolledger bitcoin and the currency unit of that ledger bitcoins bitcoin and other blockchains operate  while the traditional transaction market for us dollars is closed more than half that time including nights weekends and holidays—although venmo and paypal are helping there for small paymentswhile the bitcoin protocol can be slow bitcoins used on other networks like ethereum and the lightning network function like paypal sitting on top of us dollars the lightning network can handle many more transactions at much lower fees the technical challenges for using bitcoin as a form of payment seem solvable but bitcoin still does not function as a great medium of exchange at least for items priced in us dollars given the volatility of bitcoin it’s hard to buy a tesla model s with bitcoin when tesla raises the price by  if bitcoin falls  against usd the night beforebitcoin as a store of valueus residents are fortunate the us dollar is relatively stable while bitcoin can certainly add value to us investors as a store of value against a depreciating currency drawing similarities to gold as a store of value the bar is higher against the dollar but for venezuelans nigerians or markets with hyperinflation and dramatic losses in the purchasing power of their currencies bitcoin could function as a wealth protectorvaluing bitcoin and other crypto assetspaul thinks bitcoin has a  trillion addressable market just as a store of value for everyone in the world half of the world’s population desires an asset that cannot be easily confiscated or depreciated by printing more currencyto value bitcoin apply a probability of it reaching your estimate of an addressable market—and then apply a discount rate for how long it will take to get there paul thinks this is why bitcoin is like a series c venture capital investment—fraught with failure risk but with big payoff potentialhow high can bitcoin gowhile it is up significantly from its lows bitcoin is currently priced around  its  highs in prior market cycles bitcoin hit – its prior peak or around – which would equate to around  per bitcoinin paul’s view bitcoin could see gains of – from current levelspaul also sees higher beta assets like ethereum and “altcoins” performing significantly better and rising up to – higher in this cycle but we note words of caution for these “altcoins” belowvaluation models for bitcoin and other crypto assets have not been welltested given limited live history while paul makes a case for their inclusion in portfolios he also recognizes the risks one topic that merits further discussion– how should investors think about allocating to bitcoin in portfolios given the riskreturn profilecon coinspaul is a skeptic on crypto indexes at the present while bitcoin and ethereum are wellknown assets many of the “altcoins” are highly speculative and some are even scams paul recommends significant due diligence on any crypto asset other than bitcoin we think any asset investment requires investor diligence including where that asset fits within an investor’s overall portfolio and financial circumstancesthis was a fascinating conversation we’ll be coming back to bitcoin on the podcast and our blog including a bullbear debate on bitcoin in two weeks please listen to this full
