the year was  the month june day  in an astounding ico bancor raised  eth  million at the time dethroning the previous icorecord holder — the daothe hype surrounding the project was immense it was to be the first decentralized exchange based on the automated market maker amm protocol no more order books no more liquidity problems bancor was going to give rise to the era of the dex and it did so by showing the feasibility of ammhowever it soon fell into an economic stagnation the team was working on the platform consistently improving it but for whatever reason it never took off as uniswap and sushiswap later did back then yield farming was not a thing and the hurdle of requiring each project to buy and stake bnt in order to set up a pool were problems that barred the exchange from competing with other defi platformsadvertisementit was in  when bancor entered its renaissance period through the introduction of several smart features and innovations the exchange grew from a measly  million tvl to today’s  million and growing in this article i will explore exactly what bancor did to regain momentumbancor total value locked from  february  to  february  which grew from  million to over  million defi pulsein october  bancor released  which came with a breakthrough innovation — the main reason i would argue that the platform is on the rise — singlesided exposure standard liquidity pools on uniswap and sushiswap work in the familiar fashion – two assets are bundled together while liquidity providers provide well liquidity by itself not very lucrative these pools became gold mines when liquidity mining was introduced ie rewards in protocol tokens began being paid out to liquidity providers for instance sushiswap rewards their liquidity providers with sushi tokens the more a liquidity provider has invested the more sushi they earnhowever there’s one big issue with liquidity pools and amm in general and that is impermanent loss we won’t delve into the specifics of il but let’s just say that it’s sometimes suboptimal to keep assets in a liquidity pool when compared to simply holding them in your wallet liquidity mining programs aimed to balance that equation but they didn’t solve the issue the issue being that you have to supply equal parts of the two assets in a pool thus becoming exposed to two volatility factorslong story short bancor’s singlesided exposure feature solves the il problem it does so by allowing investors to stake only one of the assets in a pool here’s how it works let’s say that i want to join the daibnt pool on bancor before  i would have to buy equal parts in bnt and dai nowadays however i can buy only dai dai being a stablecoin will always preserve its value thanks to the impermanent loss protection allowing me to stay in the pool without worrying about the market performance of bntthe bancor liquidity pool impermanent loss protection lifecycle bancoras you can see from the image above bancor costakes the required bnt from their own protocol and then covers up any impermanent losses with the swap fees it has collected on its stake the costaked bnt and the remainder of the collected fees after covering up any il is burned to keep the overall supply of bnt in check there’s one key factor though when a liquidity provider joins a pool they’re not protected instantly but rather their assets receive  coverage per day thus a  il protection is reached after staying  days in a pool selfevidently this feature both allows time for enough fees to accrue to cover for any impermanent loss and forces liquidity providers to stay putsounding too good to be true when i first got wind of this i decided to test it out it turns out that it works — you really do stake only one asset better yet the apy on the stablecoin pools is currently more than  which in conjunction with the il protection is simply unheard ofthe bancor data page showing all the major pools and their apys from  february  bancormoreover since there’s a specific amount of bnt allocated to each pool there is a cap on the amount of the other asset for example at the time of writing the daibnt pool has a slot of just about  dai this limited availability makes these pools very lucrative but also allows for a more resistant apy“the protocol invests bnt into whitelisted pools to support singlesided nonbnt deposits eg  link triggers  bnt minted by the protocol into the link pool protocolsupplied bnt generally remains in the pool earning fees for the protocol until the bnt and its accrued fees are burned each pool has a limit on the amount of bnt that can be provided by the protocol for this purpose “coinvestment limit” when this limit is reached bnt must be provided by users in order for the pool to expand or governance can vote to increase the limit” the company stated in one of their latest announcementsin terms of transaction fees bancor tends to be on the expensive side compared to uniswap and sushiswap however for example you only need to perform two transactions to start yield farming on bancor approval and staking compared to three on uniswap and sushiswap approval providing liquidity and then staking pool tokens moreover a new “top secret pool design” as per this bancor announcement from  february is in the “final stages of research” and is intended to reduce gas costs for transactions on the platformthe project has also deployed a demo of its platform on offchain labs’s  solution — arbitrum rollup as per the latest news they are waiting for arbitrum’s mainnet launch after which it is expected that bancor will be integrated to work on a rollup for those unaware this means instant transaction confirmations and negligible transaction feesmoving on let’s talk user interface i have used bancor a couple of years back and i did like the ui it was simple and intuitive they have kept their style over the years the new design is even better upgraded to match the new features that have been introduced over the course of the last few years joining a liquidity pool requires only a handful of clicks and the portfolio management page is neat it makes it very easy to withdraw the bnt that are available to be claimed or to stake them in another pool to farm even more bntan example of a bancor portfolio pagein fact bancor prides itself on being the home of yield farmers that don’t rush to dump their rewards but rather reinvest them back into the platform — in the announcement from  february the team stated that more than  of the bnt rewards are restakedmore recently on  february bancor launched vortex their leveraged liquidity service it allows investors to sell vbnt the token received when bnt is staked in a pool on bancor and do whatever they wish with the borrowed assets essentially it allows for leveraged liquidity mining which is becoming very popular thanks to platforms like alpha homorain response to the sudden rise in popularity of bancor the bnt token has almost tripled in value — going from a little over a dollar at the start of the year to close to six nowadays
