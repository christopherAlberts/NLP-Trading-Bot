are far more than just a capital provider which we get into in some depth they do provide capital to companies in the fintech space and in other areas but they’re more than their fund they are really a partner for growth companies that’s really what they focus onwe talk about their thesis the unique way of raising the fund particularly who their lps are and we talk about what are some of the things they look for in a company what kinds of companies they invest in the check sizes they write the typical kind of situations that they’re looking for also it has a fascinating take on what’s going on with embedded finance which we also talk about in some depth and also what’s coming down the pipe it really was a fascinating interview hope you enjoy the showwelcome to the podcast billybilly libby how are you thanks for having me peterpeter i’m great thanks for coming on you know i want to get this started you’ve got a really interesting career you’ve spent some time on wall street why don’t you give the listeners a little bit of background about yourself before billy great so coming out of college which seems like a long time ago it’s actually my  birthday today so…peter oh happy birthday i didn’t know we were going to be recording on your birthdaybilly yeah and i just was very lucky you know when i started interviewing goldman sachs was the first company that said look we see a lot more of you than you see of us and if you trust us we’ll put you in the right seat and that ended up being electronic trading i’ve always liked technology and data and being in a more fast paced world and in  covering clients like getgo dijon two sigma which nobody had heard of or wanted to deal with you know just gives you i think the early days of fintech that always helped me stay close to startups and ultimately…it took a while but i think that first exposure really helped me start  which is you know this intersection of quant trading and technology startup investingpeter so was there an aha moment what was the genesis of billy so i think there were a few aha moments so i was sitting at dinner probably five years ago with one of my partners jason finger who started seamless and he saw me looking at my phone and he said what are you looking at i said oh most of my investments because i’m in quant trading are in quant trading funds you know which are very short duration and very liquid investments and i said it was a very volatile day my portfolio did really wellhe looked at me crosseyed and he said look as the founder of seamless i get shown some of the most interesting technology startup opportunities because that’s what i should be seeing and that’s where i can add value and so my portfolio right now is worth anywhere from zero to infinity peter laughs it was like the most polar opposite worlds and jason said how can i access the opportunities you have and i said the same thing right back to himand so the next day we put together a club of the ten most interesting tech founders and the ten most interesting quant founders and we all organized it really well we all shared our best deals and it really was meant to bring smart people together because if you bring people with different experiences you create new opportunitiespeter rightbilly and from that we started seeing opportunities in the tech world where change was really happening that had a tremendous amount of predictability in their earnings and so the first company that we invested in was called filmrise and they take data from netflix hulu amazon youtube and roku and they can track what people are watching digitally and they can estimate what the value is of different types of tv content based on those eyeballsand so they were raising capital to go and acquire more libraries and the quant side of our group started looking at all their cohorts and said wow you’re buying the rights to all these old british mini series and detective shows and sports documentaries and you’re buying them at onetime revenue and you’re selling them to netflix at nine times and you have this diversified pool of assets and you have this massive excess spread and you have collateral from the contracts but why are you raising equity and the founders said we’re a tech company you know that’s how we growpeter alright laughsbilly and so i think just looking at the world in a different way we just kept finding all these really interesting tech companies where there was a way to isolate part of their business and help them grow without sacrificing dilution or control and i think with this aha was kind of bringing together these two worldspeter okay so is that your main investment thesis then you know is it bringing together companies that really don’t need to raise equity because obviously equity is expensive and you get massive dilution if you’re a fast growing tech company so is that the main thesis to try and avoid founders doing thatbilly yeah i think there’s two elements here one is for capital intensive businesses there’s often not enough equity so like you know you could go and accelerate your growth a lot faster if you had access to more capital the second is the founders especially in the early stages are giving up a lot of their company permanently for something that’s measurable and short duration activityi think the common thing in all of these is data like data lets you price assets and everything we do now is captured in data i think  of the world’s data has been captured in the last two years so everything we do is going to be measurable and so i figure we’re going to see this huge tailwind of like creative ways to finance like specific parts of the business versus equity kind of being the soul for all growthpeter right right right yeah so then before i go any further i want to dig into who your lps are because now you’ve got a very different kind of approach here so why don’t you just give the listeners some background therebilly sure so it goes back to the thesis of the club you know it was all about sourcing finding interesting deals there’s a lot more capital than there are opportunities and i think that’s compounded and so our lps we have  lps that are all interesting business builders so that dna of the club has become part of our fun that’s number one and that includes people like ted zagat and rich riley and ross garon the other founders of seamless founders of ticketmaster so i think really building our fund around these individuals has helped to see interesting opportunitiesand number two founders working with  have to feel comfortable with us i think you know the best day of your life is getting a deadline from fortress or victory park or all these kind of institutional lenders and the like the second best day of your life is when you refinance thatpeter right laughsbilly and so i think you need people that have been founders that have sat in that seat that can really help educate the companies of like what are the different options out there because you’re asking them to go a little bit against the traditional like kind of vc playbookpeter so then do your lps get…do they help you source deals like help you in the selling process i guess helping close these dealsbilly very much so if you look at our first fund over  of our deals came from our lps and that’s number one i think there’s just a lot of different ways to help founders so one is capital you know i’ve been on multiple calls with jason helping founders talk about estate planning again a lot of founders kind of think about what to do after they’ve had an event versus beforepeter rightbilly so like there’s all these ways that we can open doors for new customers helping them hire so i think we viewed credit is like a very powerful tool to help founders grow but also maintaining that like equity mindset of adding value not in a temporary partner so we will only invest in a company where we do equity and debt so i view it as a hybrid venture fund not a credit fundpeter okay that’s fair enough so then obviously venture debt is a pretty well established industry i mean you’ve got silicon valley bank that’s been doing it for decades is that…what’s the difference in what you do and what silicon valley bank doesbilly it’s a great question and i think there’s room for everybody here so venture debt primarily underwrites the vc so if you raise more equity we’ll give you  of that in debt based on my quant background and just based on the thesis of our fund we can look in an asset of a businessso thrasio which is one of our largest investments which is buying stores on amazon and rolling them up we can look at that activity and say you’re buying assets you’re stabilizing ebitda you’re growing ebitda and you have a diversified pool of assets we will give you credit for that activity independent of any equity you raise so if your business is producing revenue and ebitda we can fund that growth with capital from  whereas venture debt is very much tethered to if you raise more equity we’ll give you more debt so like the total cost is quite expensive and still doesn’t really solve the problem for founders around dilutionpeter right right so to get the venture debt you’ve got to get the venture money in the first place and if you don’t…i mean do you find that there’s a lot of good companies out there that…you know venture has crazy valuations we were talking before we record here the crazy world we live in now are you finding that ceos and founders are really more open or less open to debt than……because you get a crazy valuation maybe you take the equity rightbilly we think there’s always room for equity it’s just the question of what’s the size and when so i think for us and going back to our lps it’s really critical to find companies kind of preseries a before they’ve gone and raised a big institutional equity round and so in some ways our slogans become skip your a or delay your apeter rightbilly so often company raises their seed round they prove the model they have some repeatability and the next milestone is to go raise the large series a and you know if they can go from five customer to ten customers so they can go from onestates to twostates or from one continent to another continent like often we can help them have another milestone just continuing their business activity versus having to raise another equity round prematurely to do that so that’s oneand then number two is just like a lot of companies and i think this is exciting for lendit……you know when we started  the name is the top corner of a goal like this hardtofind skillbased it’s a soccer reference and if you just take a step back you know any company regardless of industry that has customers and has data will be able to offer financingpeter rightbilly and so i think a lot of it is educating and working with the companies to help them almost create a new product line so if you’re slice which sells technology to independent pizzerias which i’m a personal investor in it’s not too far before they will offer financing products to the thousands of pizzerias you know for account receivable and inventory and bulk buying so i think a lot of it is like educating companies of other products that they can offer where they may not have had the capital to do sopeter yeah that’s super interesting because embedded finance is one of the hot topics in lending we’ve had the zach from plaid talk about every company can become a fintech company and it’s part of what it is i mean because look at that idea you just talked about slice has…the data they have is probably far better than any bank is going to have far better than any…unless you’re vertically focused on that industry you’re not going to have the same kind of depth and breadth of data i would imaginebilly definitely and look the killer of fintech is cac and so if you have the customers and you have the data…so i think it’s proper for  to partner with a lot of these interesting companies kind of be that first credit facility you know what i’ve learned is when you’re a startup the most important thing is certainty of capital flexibility of capital than cost and if we can help founders expand their product set or grow into a business you know you’d rather do that with a temporary cost of capital than a permanent cost of capital so a lot of these is…and that’s why i’m excited to be here is how do we help founders become more aware of what options are available and what cost of capital truly ispeter yeah i get that so then it sounds like you’re talking…i mean you really aren’t focusing on any particular vertical right how do you decide sort of where to kind of take your focusbilly i think we love helping solve complicated problems for founders and i think based on jason’s background we have a focus on ecommerce you know i think when he started seamless…i always tell the story but i think it’s fascinating you know just kind of looking at the world differentlyhe was a lawyer for a minute and saw everyone ordering their dinner and giving the receipts to the back office and he saw that he’d get his own credit card that pay  cash back and just started taking everyone’s dinner order himself…and giving the damn receipts to the back office and paul his partner who’s one of our lps said hey what restaurants around new york city will pay us  for the dinner order and that’s how seamless startedso i think you know our core focus is ecommerce and fintech and that’s receivables and like online acquisitions and inventory rolls ups and then i think about a third of our bookers’ special situations where maybe we’re helping a founder buy back his company you know at a really low basis to where it’s valued so we’re comfortable lending money because we know that company itself is worth a lot morewe’re lending money to founders against their stock and so i think the ability in ……you know my other partner alex urdea understands credit and underwriting really well so the fact that we can underwrite the equity of the business and what it’s worth from jason and underwrite the asset from alex i think it lets us have a couple of different ways to lend money because…you know the reality is if everyone had the same loan tape and the saw the performance of a fintech company banks would be competing for that so we’ve done things where we can just you know help founders solve complicated problems primarily in technology ecommerce fintechpeter right right so you’ve mentioned a couple of names so maybe can you give the listeners…i know some names that they know in the fintech space that are part of your portfoliobilly sure so i’ll start with one since we just saw tesla make a big announcement…peter yes exactlybilly one of our companies that i’m very excited about is called crusoe energy systems and chase lochmiller also comes from…he was at jump trading and polychain he’s a personal friend he’s actually an lp in  and started his company about two years ago where he created portable data centers that he’s bringing to the middle of the united states to you know wyoming north dakota where there’s a large amount of oil drilling but there’s no pipeline and so when you drill oil they often will ship the oil on transit but the natural gas gets burned and flared so i believe there’s more natural gas getting burned in the us every year than the amount of energy consumed in japanpeter wowbilly it’s enormous and so he’s built these proprietary data centers that can be moved on site to the oil fields and he’s basically getting paid to take this natural gas and converting it to energy to mine bitcoinpeter laughs that’s greatbilly and really what he’s doing…the reason why i’m so excited about the business is he is capturing this exhausted energy and he is initially using it to mine bitcoin but over time it’s a distributed cloud computing business to do anything that’s computationally intensivepeter rightbilly and so it goes back there’s more data than we have energy to crunch and so he needed capital for the data centers themselves like for the generators that had nothing to do with bitcoin but because it was a tech company and a startup and doing crypto you know the traditional equipment financiers…you know all these traditional lenders and sources of capital were not available so he would either have to slow growth or to really dilute himselfso  created a  million facility to fund the distributed group of these projects where we finance the data centers that had kind of this individual collateral with an upside based on crypto so i think that’s like a really exciting example of how you can isolate a core growth activity and were able to solve a problem which actually helped the company accelerate growth and reduce dilutionpeter i love that too because it’s also using waste something was going to waste and doing somethingbilly i’m super excited about this everyone should keep an eye out for it and just super interesting space you know but again bringing together like a lot of these his partner comes from oil and gas so that’s one example of where i really view this as a partner solving that and we’re also smaller equity investoranother company is called thrasio which is buying stores on amazon so there’s  small business owners on amazon selling hiking poles and white boards and you know you name it they make over  million of ebitda a year but each one of them…it’s easy to start a business online you know we could leave this and start a business selling any product very quickly but the cost to scale it is still is what traditionally is the limiting factor so you know inventory capital and supply chain expertise and marketing dollars and all the things that are capital intensive so thrasio is rolling up all these small stores on amazon into one big holdco and providing massive operational excellence and capital to themand so it’s the fastest unicorn profitable unicorn in the us or one of them they just completed a multibillion dollar equity valuation raise we were the first equity and debt provider when the company was in the you know tens of millions of dollars valuation they raised i think  million of equity and we ended up giving them almost  or  million of debt before they raised another dollar of equityso this is like a great example going back to venture debt of like if it’s working we can scale with the company in an undiluted way versus requiring kind of equity checkpoints so that’s another one we are unbelievably excited about and i think if we had this call  years ago we would be talking about rolling up dry cleaners and coffee shops and gyms you know all these subscale fragmented assets i can say what’s new is old you have all these businesses that are being created online that have traditional capital needspeter rightbilly and i think there’s that kind of we’re not splitting the atom here we’re just trying to you know solve a problem that has existedpeter so it sounds like your average check size is a pretty wide range from what you’re saying what’s the smallest check size you do and what is the averagebilly i think the earlier that we can start with the business the more value we can add so we’ve started with a  million check because we love the founder it was the simplest way to get started in a relationship and show that we could be partners and i think the largest upfront check we’ve done is  million the largest facility we’ve done is  millionpeter wow and what are the terms if you’re providing this is everything unique or you have sort of a standard set of terms that you like to applybilly i think everything is bespoke but i can walk through you know kind of a general framework i think a couple of things that we’ve done you know that i’m proud of is we raised a smaller fund i think we could have raised a larger fund but our last fund was  million so we don’t feel obligated to…if  million is what the company needs we’re happy with that position sizeso many of these funds have raised gargantuan dollars and so their goal seek is to try put as much money in the company as possible so generally our facilities are bespoke and you know i’d say generally they’re kind of like low teens with high advance rates you know with just generally more flexibility so that could be higher concentration limits or higher advance rate or just you know some of the tools that companies need in the early phases when they’re still figuring it outpeter right right and what about term length are you doing this over say three years five years what are you trying…billie i think our average facility is usually in place for two years maybe three yearspeter rightbilly and we like to work with other partners you know  people have been able to bring in parallel facilities you know we always…i think a lot of people in the lending space ask for freebies and warrants and have all these hidden fees around origination and we keep it very simple there’s none of those hidden fees around you know like unused fees and origination feesas i said we just wanted to provide capital to companies we’re excited about the business and so we will buy equity and be an equity partner not…i would think it’s funny when these credit funds say you know we don’t really care about the equity outcome i said why are you asking for warrants peter laughs i think it’s just creating alignment with the founderspeter right right fair enough so i want to go back to this thing i think you’ve touched on it but i want to dig into it a bit more because we had a revenuebased financing session with you at lendit last year and you said this interesting thing you said that data creates asset classes is that sort of some of the things you’ve been talking about the slice thing but maybe can you just kind of tease that out a little bit morebilly sure and i think it’s actually quite exciting if you take a step back because if you and i wanted to create a business that wasn’t going to be a unicorn but you knew that you could own the majority of the business like that would be a great business to start so i think to give examples might be more informative than just me talking so you know when covid ends and everyone goes back to get an internship at mckinsey or goldman or lendit or  you know most people coming to new york city or boston or london have to get an apartment before they get a paycheck and a lot of people don’t have that cash flowand so there’s going to be companies that integrate with the payroll of all these large corporations and will be able to validate employment and how much are they getting paid to give an advance for an apartment for a percentage of their future paycheck the uber driver that gets paid every two weeks but needs money more frequently companies like claire and others will help validate that transaction those events even thrasio you know they’re turning the amazon seller into an asset twenty years ago you go and get excel or quickbooks from a pizzeria now you can log into their amazon account and check everyday salesyou know people were going back to school and getting trained to be a pilot you can predict what the probability is of their future earnings in job placement and they can effectively sell equity in themselves today to get their school paid for so i think like you know everything that we do is going …i think …an eyeopening…it was an aha moment in my career there were two aha moments one when i was at knight capital briefly the new york stock exchange and nasdaq at that time charge all firms effectively the same commission to tradeso if you were trading against blackrock as a market maker that order would have a lot of impact because of the size of the order so if you sold the share today that would keep moving up in price because of the size blackrock needed to buy if you’re trading against two sigma they’re trading because i think at this microsecond there’s some type of mispricing so you’re unlikely to make money thereyou know if my mother is buying a share of google for my grandkids like she has no size or view and so knight and citadel went to all the retail firms and said look if we know it’s you and we’re not getting picked up or run over we can give you a better price and so this whole…it’s like insurance like micropricing the healthy versus the sickpeter rightbilly and then which said hey if you live in new york city  of people are weekend drivers and they’re paying the same insurance as the daily drivers so now we can put a tracker in your car and track your insurance by the mile so like this whole tailored financing and micropricing i think is going to be like in everything we do and it’s going to just change you know what’s kind of experimental where you should be using equity versus what’s predictable where you should be using things like peter and why do you think there’s not more companies doing what you’re doing is it just because it’s hard because there’s just not that many you know there’s not much in the way of debt financing for growth companies it’s not a really well populated niche so why do you think that isbilly i think it’s going to change i think you’re going to see a couple of vcs that are going to start offering credit alongside equity i think qed and andreessen horowitz some of the more advanced fintech firms i think are going to just…it’s almost like… i look back when goldman started banking and the companies went public so they created sales and trading and you know they needed the companies and wanted to go and raise debt so they created fixed incomeso i think you’re going to see more of the larger vcs become asset managers but i think it’s just bringing together people from different backgrounds like when i really tried to put up  together it was to get the dna of the equity and the debt together in one place i think most firms are either one or the otherpeter right right yeah i have had heard rumors of debt funds coming from vcs so we’ll see what happens there okay so we’re almost out of time but before i let you go maybe you could sort of take a look at fintech today we’ve covered a few topics already but what do you think are some of the interesting trends that we haven’t talked about in fintech todaybilly it’s a good question i mean we touched briefly on embedded finance and we touched briefly on data i think every company is going to offer some form of a financial product and i think fintech just becomes what is part of a business and i think it’s extremely exciting i mean you’ve talked about that a lot some are not going to deliver the… i think we’re early in embedded fintech i just think it’s going to be…it’ll be part of kind of every business versus it’s own categoryand then the other thing that i think is very interesting is the emergence of like the small business owner like it’s so much easier today to start a business you know if it was  years ago we needed like rent a corner store front and we’d have to get insurance and we’d have to …like the burden to be a small business owner i remember when we talked briefly about some of your prior entrepreneurial experiences maybe in printing i forget what it was but i just think what amazon’s doing and shopify like the rails to be your own entrepreneur i think is…or starting a store in etsyi think it’s so good for society and the ability to kind of go and get not just sba financing but getting inventory financing from payability getting marketing financing from clearbank growth capital from  i think the ability to start a business online and the access to capital because you can validate data i think it’s going to open up a whole new world of entrepreneurs and it’s not like vcbacked entrepreneurs it’s like the you know ability to kind of run your own small businesspeter yeahbilly so i think another big theme is the…like i don’t know what you call it like the hippo you know like there’s the unicorn where everyone’s trying to go and be this multi billion dollar company i think all these creative financing options will let people kind of create small but very strong businesses like franchising peter right for me…i mean my dad was an entrepreneur i’m an entrepreneur and this is my fifth company lendit it may well be my last because i find it endlessly fascinating but you know i think you’re right it’s really interesting the barrier to entry to being a small business owner has just gone down so far from what it was even a decade agobilly yeah we could start a youtube channel i think that scenario that we’re looking at like rolling up…you know you can look at the number of viewers on a channel and predict future revenue instagram accounts wave tv like you know buying instagram accounts based on the number of viewers that they’ve attracted like what’s the value of somebody who’s a viewer of a channelpeter rightbilly to me it’s going to open up the ability for people to start businesses and i feel  is like we’re earning a good return but we’re just helping finance like some of these kind of new and emerging industries that have not been like a focus for vcspeter right right okay so last question then what’s next for you guys are you going to be raising a new fund are you doing more of the same what are you planning for this year and beyond for that matterbilly so we just closed our second fund in november and we hit our hard cap of  million i personally got a lot of satisfaction out of having this really unique lp base i love learning from them and talking with them and finding the opportunities the world has a lot of flexibility you know if you go and get institutional capital you kind of take away a lot of the flexibility to solve problems for founders so i think on the fund side it’s like keeping fund aum around this size like we can start small but we can do a big enough check for that first phase and i think we’re just brainstorming more special situations like should we do a spacyou know we think we see a lot of interesting companies that are kind of inbetween focus areas should be incubate businesses should we partner with the companies in our portfolio thrasio started a business that is lending money to amazon sellers not acquiring them called yardline you know clearbank to me it’s the future of venture they sit on so much data around so many companies so i think there’s a lot of ways for us to keep the fund size the same and build kind of almost like equity expressions around the fund in partnership for ourselvespeter right right interesting well we’ve run out of time billy it’s been really an eyeopening interview i really appreciate your coming on the show todaybilly thank you so much if i was talking to you as a potential partnership i would say you know peter you have your lendit conference next year can we help you finance some of your future receivables so you can bring cash today against what you expect to get in the future you know you want to roll out lendit europe is there enough predictability around demand that we can help finance that versus you having to raise more equity so i think the most fun is working with founders and kind of try to uncover their goals and figuring out if there is a creative way that we can help solve that with some company between equity and debt debt equitypeter okay we’ll leave it there thanksbilly okay byepeter you know i just want to go back to something billy just said there he talked about data and how it’s really creating more opportunities for small business owners for entrepreneurs everywhere and how…this is something that…i know that karen mills the former head of the small business administration talks about talked about it in her new book she called it small business utopia and what billy was talking about there really points to the same thing and it’s all around datathe data that every small business has is going to really…all of it is going to be used to really ascertain how healthy the business is what kind of capital it needs what the price of that capital is with companies like billy doing creative ways to help companies grow you’re really looking at a situation the future where you know small business owners will be able to get access to the capital they need whether you’re just a local pizza place or whether you’re wanting to roll up a hundred different pizza places and create a juggernaut there’s going to be a capital that is going to be available to you and i think that’s going to be super excitinganyway on that note i will sign
