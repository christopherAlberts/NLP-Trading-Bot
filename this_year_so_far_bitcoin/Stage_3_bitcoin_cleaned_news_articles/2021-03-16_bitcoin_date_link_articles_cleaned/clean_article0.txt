the bachelors cluelessness about race comes to a head in season finaleenlarge this image toggle caption craig sjodinabc craig sjodinabcits a safe bet this wasnt the conversation that producers of the bachelor expected would cap matt james season when they named him as the unscripted dating shows first black starbut the tense emotional exchange monday night between james and former girlfriend rachael kirkconnell — where he revealed why he broke off their relationship after photos of her at an antebellum souththemed party surfaced on social media — is the kind of conversation about race and white cluelessness that the bachelor has been avoiding for far too longrachael might not understand what it means to be black in americarachael might not understand what it means to be black in america james told host emmanuel acho during the shows after the final rose special monday dropping a line that felt like the understatement of the yearindeed the shows refusal to appreciate what it means to be black on the bachelor is what made this momentit led producers to stumble into a roiling racecentered controversy that has sidelined the shows longtime host chris harrison obliterated the storybook romance set up by months of pretaped episodes and forced the white woman james selected from a field of nearly  contestants to tearfully explain herself on national televisioni see someone who was living in this ignorance without thinking who it might be hurting kirkconnell said looking at a photo of herself hanging with friends at that fraternity party in  decked out in frilly dresses celebrating the spectacle of a bygone eracivil rights activists have criticized these kinds of parties for many years noting that they elevate the beauty of the old souths plantations while erasing their roots in the bondage and brutal oppression of black slaves its similar to the denialism among some who seek to honor symbols of the confederacy while downplaying or ignoring its role in fighting to maintain slaverytelevision the bachelor finale will air as the franchise faces a racial reckoning the bachelor finale will air as the franchise faces a racial reckoning listen ·  kirkconnell admitted as much on monday noting some supporters told her they didnt think attending such parties was racist because they personally were not racisti did get a lot of people saying this is normal where i grew up  she said people need to realize that just saying this is normal where i came from  that doesnt make it right that doesnt make it okthe bachelor stumbled into this mess because the show has refused to face how deeply centered on white culture the whole enterprise truly is — naming james as its first black star in  seasons after years of criticism for the omission it has seemingly shown little regard for the extra pressure nonwhite people face in trying to compete on the programworst of all the show seems to have no clue how deeply embedded racism is in the fabric of american life — and how dating especially across racial lines can bring out those issues in ways that are explosive and damaging if not handled wellacho a former pro football linebacker who wrote a book and hosts a webcast called uncomfortable conversations with a black man led mondays discussion with the deft charm of a man used to untangling complex racial dynamics for clueless white people he explained thorny concepts and sympathized with james who spoke about the extra burden of avoiding stereotypes while starring on the show its just what were conditioned to do as black men james said making people comfortable with your blacknessacho stepped up when longtime host chris harrison announced he would step away from the program — a move that came after harrison tried to defend kirkconnell by suggesting that antebellum parties werent considered offensive in  and criticizing the woke police for targeting herit was a clumsy attempt at damage control that only made the controversy worse now harrisons future with the franchise is in doubt — he wont be hosting the next two seasons of the bachelorette airing this summer and fall — even as his dismissive attitude seemed completely in tune with how producers have shrugged off past criticisms regarding race on the showrachel lindsay who became the first black woman to star in the spinoff series the bachelorette in  found her season marred by the antics of a white man who antagonized many of the shows black male contestants and had a history of inflammatory social media posts lindsay who was interviewing harrison for the tv show extra when he dropped his woke police comments has emerged as a consistent critic of the franchises handling of racewhy doesnt the show do a better job of screening its white contestants backgrounds and why did it take so long for the show to name a black man to star in the bachelor in the first place these are questions that are tough to answer for another reason the shows producers dont talk openly about what they do or why they do itjames has perfected the shows style of speaking in vague platitudes so it was tough to discern from his answers monday exactly what happened between him and kirkconnell when the pictures surfaced they both implied that she didnt take the controversy seriously enough at firstit was in the context of you not fully understanding my blackness  and what it would mean for our kids when i saw these things floating around the internet james told kirkconnell about his decision to end their relationship i didnt sign up to have this conversationthat may also be part of the problem because the bachelor is basically a princess fantasy — a soap opera featuring nonactors centered on a hunky guy choosing a romantic partner in the most idealized settings possiblebut talking about and understanding how race works in america is the opposite of fantasy its a difficult challenging process that often requires facing uncomfortable truths and james admitted in an interview on abcs good morning america on tuesday that he didnt discuss race or the challenge of dating across racial lines with kirkconnell before the controversy emergedits tough to know whether a franchise as manipulative and problematic as the bachelorbachelorette can ever correct itself enough to consistently handle racial issues wellbut with another black woman scheduled to star in a future season of the bachelorette — michelle young the runnerup in james season was announced as star of the shows  season monday — abcs highprofile franchise better raise its game in a hurryor it wont be long before another season goes down in flames felled by its ignorance of race in a world that will no longer tolerate white cluelessness
