the year  was declared by the us national aeronautics and space administration nasa as the then second warmest year on record the same year the world’s first bitcoin was minedbitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency that offers a novel type of transaction method as it does not involve the exchange of conventional currencies digital currency has the potential to revolutionize the economy in many waysbitcoin’s total worth is about  trillion the cost of it however is the environment in an interview bill gates said “bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind and so it’s not a great climate thing” some researchers have claimed that the cryptocurrency alone could shatter global climate goalsbitcoins or other cryptocurrencies are not printed by state institutions they are generated via a process called mining mining refers to the use of supercomputers to verify bitcoin transactions by solving highly complex mathematical equations in return the miner is rewarded with some bitcoins these computers are connected to cryptocurrency networks the faster the computing the higher the processing capability to increase their likelihood of winning bitcoins miners have established largescale warehouses and industrial parksalmost all mining processes run on supercomputers called mining machines these computers consume an enormous amount of energy the consumption increases with the deployment of additional equipment necessary for the maintenance of the computers coolants are among the essentials to keep the computers’ temperature low for efficiency for this reason many miners tend to move towards cooler areas to set up their mining networks iceland for instance has giant hubs of miningthe consumption of mass scale electricity creates a significant amount of carbon footprint it is estimated that ten minutes of mining costs  worth of electricity bitcoin mining power usage per year is more than twice the amount of power consumed by amazon apple facebook microsoft and google combined this is equivalent to  tera watt hour of electricity this figure roughly represents the amount of electricity used by norway per year some sources have matched bitcoins energy draining to that of switzerland’sincrease in temperature by  c is catastrophic for climate it is noteworthy that the contemporary stage of cryptocurrency mining is just the tip of the iceberg with the increasing operations of ecash mining global temperature could increase by  ccarbon emission is not the only environmental hazard of bitcoin mining the devices installed in the process are not reusable the devices become part of electronic waste once they become out of date only  percent of electronic waste is recycled worldwide the rest adds to the electronic waste pollution as many components are made up of plastic and other nonrecyclable materialschina and the united states remain the key contributors of carbon footprints being the world’s largest producer of carbon dioxide emissions china carries out  percent of global bitcoin mining more than half of the mining energy comes from coal in china electricity is cheap there which is feasible for miners the growing scale of mining combined with industrial projects of its belt and road initiative bri will exponentially augment the environmental wastethe mayoral candidate of new york andrew yang has announced that they plan to invest in making the city a hub for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if elected the us already ranks the world’s second largest carbon emitter if the world’s financial capital new york city becomes the next btc hub the emissions will increase following new york’s new financial model other parts of the world will also pitch in their fair share of the extensive  emissionsaccording to a study by cambridge university  percent of bitcoin generating energy is renewable the other  percent however is fossil fuels bitcoin’s defenders mining argue that the process uses surplus part of energy once the primary requirements of power supply are fulfilled this may be true but it is nevertheless a motivator for production of more energy which is not possible without the yield of additional harmful greenhouse gases it is not hard to figure out the guaranteed beneficiaries of mining – the petroleum industrybitcoin is an innovation in the financial sector but it does not necessarily need to be supported by consuming far less energy visa a financial services company processes  transactions per second whereas bitcoin consumes an enormous amount of electricity to give mere  to  transactions per secondelon musk and other technology tycoons have started accepting digital cash as payment methods in their billiondollar enterprises recently his automobile manufacturing company tesla purchased  billion worth of bitcoins which spurred their demand tesla whose purpose is to make the road mobility pollutionfree by manufacturing green vehicles has started to exchange bitcoins in exchange for its productsa green company is endorsing an environmentalunfriendly payment method irony is ineluctablethe task force on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd is an organization that is working on making a global standard for corporations regarding climate change if this standard is adopted the companies will have to disclose their carbon footprint to investors this could be bad for cryptocurrency but better for the environment multinational corporations mncs like blackrock seek to assess their future investments on the basis of meeting the climate challengethe whole sector of cryptocurrency is decentralized this is one of the fundamental challenges in restricting the mining activities the decentralization has given the cryptocurrency immunity over harming the climate through emissions from its power consumptionto curb the emissions some authors of the scientific journal ‘joule’ suggest the imposition of carbon tax by regulating this ‘gamblingdriven’ source of  emissions taxing cryptocurrency would require centralizing its operations which would defeat the purpose of a decentralized financial exchange bitcoin or cryptocurrency as a whole is not in itself hazardous to the environment the colossal utilization of energy for mining and the subsequent emission is inherently the problem the intergovernmental organizations igos on climate like the paris climate agreement need to set goals for the regulation of cryptocurrencystill the most damaging agents for the climate are sectors like oil and gas dr garrick hileman head of research at blockchaincom and visiting fellow at the london school of economics is of the view that unlike traditional financial systems the functioning of bitcoin is transparent that is why it is an easy prey as compared to other industries had the energy consumption data of all corporations ‘readily available for scrutiny’ bitcoin’s perception might have been slightly differentthe bitcoin mining rush poses a threat to the climate goals of the paris climate agreement bitcoin will not kill our environment overnight but it has the ability to impact climate change seriously unless the power usage of bitcoin mining is significantly reduced it can hardly be perceived as an environmentfriendly future currencythe writer is an engineer and scholar of history
