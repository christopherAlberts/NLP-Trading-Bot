the most common way to describe bitcoin is “digital gold” it’s this simple compelling catchphrase that’s allowed bitcoin to reach the far corners of the world at  trillion in market cap bitcoin is the backbone of the crypto trading ecosystem that’s set to debut in public markets today with coinbase everyone knows gold now everyone knows bitcoin but there’s a problem bitcoin shows little sign of evolving into goldaccording to the digital store of value argument there is a future when bitcoin is fully adopted in which it will trade something like gold does relative to real interest rates and inflation but it’s not going to happen instantaneously of course it will gradually fall into this role so it follows that the bigger bitcoin gets the more it should function as a goldlike asset ie trade with some relationship to real interest rates which determine the demand for a nonyielding store of value asset at any specific snapshot of time the two don’t have to be correlated but the logic clearly demands that there should be a tightening correlation to real rates the bigger bitcoin getsthe correlation with real rates should get more inverse and with gold more positive bitcoin isn’t going to just suddenly start trading like gold one day but it should develop these characteristics if people are buying it for that usecaseso i looked at the average  and  correlations between bitcoin and real rates and bitcoin and gold going back to  first its relationship with gold remains completely random — hasn’t changed whatsoever over ten years now there is some sign that bitcoin’s relationship with real rates trended more negative over the past three years which is what you want for the “digital gold” narrative bitcoin’s average  correlation with real  rates steadily fell from  in  to  by may  but it’s still not a very strong one and since the fall of last year the relationship has broken down in an extreme way bitcoin’s correlation with real rates and gold is now the most out of whack it’s ever been which means the story people are giving for buying it is less true than it’s ever been it’s like if everyone is buying a company’s stock because they say its customer base is rising but the user base is fallingif gold were doing something unusual we might be able to say that it’s about people converting from gold to bitcoin but that’s not the case as gold is trading precisely as one would expect based on its historical relationship to real rates yes bitcoin can go through periods of adoption that are completely uncorrelated to anything else but the fact there is no discernable progress in bitcoin’s relationship with real rates or gold over the past decade is damning evidence that no matter how popular the coin gets no one’s treating it like gold a narrative that broken begs for correctionphoto by aleksi räisä on unsplash
