upon realization of bitcoin’s true value one must reconcile their economic opportunity cost with their new realityattention fellow bitcoin wealthy plebs i’ve been summoned to write about the corn and there is one topic that’s constantly in the back of my mind creeping into every decisionthe bitcoin opportunity costwhether you’ve just started your journey down the rabbit hole or you’re already telling billionaires to “have fun staying poor” by now you’ve learned about the functions and characteristics of money this is one of the first things about bitcoin that stood out to me as i hadn’t learned about it before the money a society uses should function as a store of value a medium of exchange and a unit of account diving deeper i learned about money’s different characteristics scarcity divisibility transferability etc and started to understand how societies grade money based on these characteristics to decide which forms of it are more desirable than othersmany have come to the conclusion that bitcoin earns the best overall grade on the characteristicsofmoney test and this makes it the best form of money ever cc thisisbullish i fully subscribe to the thesis that bitcoin the asset is currently functioning as the best store of value in existence and that this delays bitcoin from fulfilling the other two functions of money why would people use bitcoin to exchange value at scale when it is serving as the best store of value right now in the future when bitcoin’s volatility calms down and global adoption is above  percent people won’t feel like they’re giving up generational wealth when they use bitcoin as a medium of exchange and then bitcoin the network will shine this is all to say that we are still very much in the adoption phase and we are lucky to be here this earlyif you agree with that thinking you may have entered into a new wormhole mindset in the last few years as i did when you go down this wormhole you stop thinking about bitcoin as an investment which implies you’re trying to exit at some point after squeezing out more money than you put in instead you start to think about bitcoin as the money which exists in a better system that improves incentives trade friction efficiency saving time preference freedom innovation politics and community once you get to that point the opportunity cost of not owning bitcoin creeps into every single decisiontoday money managers use the riskfree rate of treasury bills to calculate opportunity cost of financial decisions this calculated yield basically represents the maximum amount of money you could make without taking any risk and decisions should be weighed against thisif you factor in the  percent annual governmenttargeted inflation rate via the consumer price index cpi then most interest rates are already negativenow factor in the cpi being a farcenow factor in that nothing is riskfree and this yield is subject to a counterparty that operates like a failing businessfinally you have an opportunity cost that can’t ever be verified or agreed upon as a result we can’t trust the benchmark against which most investment decisions are calculated and this leads to complete mispricing of assetssay you’re a bank and your group of investment analysts pictured below ignore all of thatyou are using the absolute worstperforming “riskfree” investment available as your opportunity cost bitcoin is basically a social experiment to see what happens if you try using the bestperforming asset of all time as your opportunity cost insteadbitcoin magazine’s nikcantmine wrote about how he weighed his personal bitcoin opportunity cost against college tuition i went to college and i can justify it because in my opinion it was a great time and i hadn’t heard of bitcoin yet but if i had i probably would have made the same decision as nik in my mind most purchases wont outperform bitcoin so if i’m buying something it better give me a large amount of enjoyment and if i’m ever selling bitcoin it better be in exchange for large amounts of time i’m not sure if it’s a blessing or curse to be at the point where every single decision financial or otherwise comes down to “hey man you should probably have more bitcoin instead”in summary enjoy the ride  is bearish pleb forever team surferjim pray for miamithanks to btcization for the nodplay me offthis is a guest post by chadcapital opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of btc inc or bitcoin magazine
