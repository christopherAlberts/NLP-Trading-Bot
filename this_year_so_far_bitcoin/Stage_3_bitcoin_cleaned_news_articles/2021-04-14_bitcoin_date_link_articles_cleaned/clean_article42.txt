the kimchi premium—the spread between bitcoin price on south korean exchanges and western exchanges—has always been an indicator attracting people’s attention in the bull market the source of this spread is rooted in the inability to easily get a substantial amount of usd out of the country due to institutional frictions thus this lack of arbitrage opportunities coupled with a huge demand for bitcoin among koreans makes bitcoin trade at a premium on korean exchanges when speculative frenzy hits the massesas with any bubble at one point when money inflows stop propping up the price it is going to crash or at least correct somewhat sometimes even a small pin is enough for the bubble to start deflating this is exactly what happened today when upbit suspended its deposits and withdrawals the premium has fallen from  percent and hit  percent at its lowest pointchart via tradingviewthis is not the first time this bubble emerged and popped in the peak of the – bull run the kimchi premium reached  percent before it all came crashing down caution from this event is one of the reasons why the market has thrown a tantrum today traders see the kimchi premium correction as a top signal and the harbinger of an overall market correctionchart via tradingviewhowever this is exactly a case of the tail wagging the dog according to coingecko the total bitcoin trading volume of the five major korean exchanges—bithumb upbit coinone gopax corbit—makes up to  percent of the global bitcoin trading volume even in a case of the collapse of the bubble on korean exchanges it should not affect the global price much local bubbles come and go which is not that significantwhat is significant however is the attention people pay to these sorts of things riskon assets such as bitcoin are dominated by narratives and the kimchi premium narrative is still a powerful one if the amount of major media outlets and twitter accounts mentioning it is any indicator as with any narrative though it usually takes several invalidations for it to stop occupying people’s mindswill today’s premium correction make the premium disappear probably not the bullish narratives for bitcoin are still untouched the demand for bitcoin didn’t go anywhere and the institutional frictions to withdraw money from the country are still in place all this makes a perfect cocktail for the bubble to continue existingit is also worth noting that the kimchi premium is not specific to bitcoin and is present for some other cryptocurrencies too reflecting the arbitrage opportunities taken by traders and the overall bullish sentiment among koreansthe kimchi premium can be a good and reliable indicator of the demand for bitcoin when taken within the context of its origin and combined with other factors affecting bitcoin’s price on the other hand used separately it can give birth to false narratives and bring a lot of misinformation and damage as with any indicator one should be cautious to use it and never make any investment decisions based on this particular piece of data alonethis is a guest post by lex moskovski opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of btc inc or bitcoin magazine
