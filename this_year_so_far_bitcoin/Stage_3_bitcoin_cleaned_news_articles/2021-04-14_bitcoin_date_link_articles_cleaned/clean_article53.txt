peter is the creator and editor of the water front online  the region’s only news organization dedicated to environmental issues in the finger lakes and upstate new york have a tip send it to  editor’s note this story was originally published by new york focus written by peter mantius his blog water front online covers the region and state’s most important environmental issuesa decade ago the bankrupt owner of the greenidge power plant in dresden new york sold the uncompetitive coalfired relic for scrap and surrendered its operating permitsfor the next seven years the plant sat idle on the western shore of seneca lake a monument to the apparent dead end reached by the state’s fossil fuel infrastructurebut today greenidge is back up and running as a bitcoin mining operation the facility hums with energyhungry computers that confirm and record bitcoin transactions drawing power from the plant’s  generator now fueled by natural gasthe mining activity is exceptionally profitable thanks to an  percent rise in bitcoin’s price since last april seeking to ride the boom the plant’s new owners plan to quadruple the power used to process bitcoin transactions by late next yearenvironmental advocates view greenidge’s ambitions if left unchecked as an air emissions nightmareand they fear that dozens of other retired or retiring fossilfueled power plants across new york could follow greenidge’s example gaining new life by repurposing as bitcoin miners or other types of energyintense data centersgreenidge’s pending applications to renew its air emissions permits promise to bring the issue to a headjudith enck a former regional administrator for the us environmental protection agency believes the state’s stance on those permits will reflect how committed the administration of gov andrew cuomo is to the climate leadership and community protection act a landmark  law requiring the state to dramatically slash air pollution“greenidge is a test for the cuomo administration as to how serious they are or are not about achieving greenhouse gas reduction goals” enck saidin a letter sent to governor cuomo last week the environmental law group earthjustice and the atlantic chapter of the sierra club warned that nearly  other upstate new york power plants could be converted to run fulltime as data centers with catastrophic consequences for statewide  emissionsmichael mckeon a spokesman for greenidge dismissed those concerns“this group has flailed around trying to find anything to oppose our environmentallysound operation for years nothing has worked because their claims have no legal or factual basis” mckeon said in reference to the sierra club’s previous unsuccessful efforts to overturn greenidge permits in court“no room for a massive expansion”atlas holdings a greenwich conn private equity firm bought the plant in  and converted it to burn natural gas rather than coal before restarting it in  over the next two years the plant’s focus gradually shifted from providing intermittent power to the grid to processing bitcoin transactionsbitcoin is a digital currency without a central storage location like a bank where transactions are recorded instead the data ledger is distributed to a network of computers worldwide miners are rewarded with bitcoin when their computers validate and record network transactionswhile bitcoin processing is extremely power intensive it has also become immensely profitable as its price has risen from  in december  to more than  this weeknow atlas sees a chance to capitalize on bitcoin’s soaring value by taking the operation public in a planned reverse merger announced last month greenidge generation holdings llc expects to be trading as a nasdaq stock by september with atlas retaining a majority interestin touting the deal to potential investors the greenidge team described the plant as a national model their stated plan was to expand it  — using at least  megawatts of power in dresden and elsewhere — by cornell university biochemist robert howarth—one of  members on the state’s climate action council which is charged with developing the plan to meet clcpa targets—said the planned expansion isn’t compatible with new york’s clean energy goals“there really is no room for a massive expansion of fossil fuel use in any sector let alone one with so little true value to new york as represented by a cryptocurrency” howarth saidhowarth noted that the law requires a  percent reduction in greenhouse gas ghg emissions by  a difficult target to meet even without the data center threatlast year greenidge’s ghg emissions were far below the plant’s annual allowance of  tons of  gasses but as greenidge ramped up bitcoin transaction processing throughout  its rolling  ghg emissions average soared nearly tenfold from  tons in january to  tons in decembergreenidge told potential investors on march  that its mining machines were drawing  megawatts of power — less than onefifth of the plant’s permitted output capacity company officials stated that would rise to  megawatts by june  and to  megawatts by the end of next year as they added new mining machinesthe more energy generated the more emissions rise earthjustice has estimated that if the plant runs near its full capacity its  emissions will soar to  million tons a year  percent above its current permitgreenidge applied last month to renew its current air permits which expire in september conor mcmahon the governor’s finger lakes representative said the state department of environmental conservation dec is reviewing the applications for completeness before developing drafts for public considerationin a statement to new york focus this week a dec spokesperson said “dec strictly oversees greenidge generation’s operations and its compliance with requirements to protect public health and the environment this facility is currently operating in compliance with its dec permits”enck who as a federal epa administrator skirmished with the dec for months over greenidge’s current title v air permit said the dec often takes a year or more to consider an application for a permit renewaldec is under little pressure to complete its review and formally renew the title v permit by september state administrative law allows a company to operate under an expired permit if its renewal application is filed on time and is under agency consideration“so the question is” enck said “would dec allow them to emit more while they consider a modification to the title v permit”howarth said the dec is in an awkward spot because the climate action council hasn’t yet delivered its draft plan for meeting clcpa requirements that’s due later this year“but i believe they should do all they can in the meantime to make decisions that are consistent with clcpa” howarth addeda regulatory helping handthe cuomo administration hasn’t allowed expired permits to slow atlas in the past four years ago the dec gave greenidge the green light to restart nearly a year before it formally approved uptodate water discharge and intake permitsthat relaxed approach to water regulation was one of a series of accommodations the cuomo administration made to enable atlas to rescue convert restart and repurpose the greenidge plantthe dec waived an environmental impact statement for the plant’s restart excluded the plant’s coal ash landfill from its environmental review of the restart and granted the plant five years to fully comply with federal clean water act regulations on water intake screens to protect aquatic life in the lakeduring the months these concessions were being hammered out atlas holdings and its comanaging partners andrew bursky and timothy fazio contributed  to gov cuomo’s reelection campaigns meanwhile greenidge paid a cuomofriendly lobbyist’s firm more than a spokesman for cuomo did not return emailed questions about whether those expenditures by atlas influenced regulatory decisionsefforts by atlas representatives to sway state and local officials date back to —nine months before atlas bought greenidge—when an attorney asked the dec to allow greenidge to avoid regulation under epa’s strict “new source review” standardthe dec flirted with that softer stance until enck sent a letter in  demanding “new source” treatmentatlas had hired mercury public relations mckeon’s firm in march  mckeon who had served as executive director of republicans for cuomo in his  campaign took the lead role on the greenidge accountduring the nearly twoyear period that mercury collected  a month from atlas the firm achieved several wins for its client including a dec consent agreement for the plant’s coal ash landfill and a pair of favorable pilot paymentinlieu of taxes deals with the yates county industrial development agency for the plant and a new  natural gas line pipeline that serves itin  greenidge paid a total of  to yates county the town of torrey and the penn yan school district on the plant and pipeline pilots that was only  percent of the total  paid to the same entities by aes greenidge in  before it closed the plant and filed for bankruptcyrecords show mercury’s mckeon and cassie prugh a former cuomo aide had lobbied yates officials in the fall of  as the pilots were being negotiatedin december  the final month of greenidge’s  retainer agreement with mercury the cuomo administration announced a  million grant in support of atlas’ restart of the plantthat gift of state taxpayer money was sufficient to cover all campaign contributions from atlas officials all greenidge lobbying payments to mercury and roughly a decade of plant and pipeline pilot payments to local entities profit per coinkeeping expenses in check was particularly important to greenidge after the market for the energy it offered for sale on the grid began to dry up the plant’s capacity factor—a measure of how much energy it generates as a proportion of the maximum amount it could produce—dropped from  percent in  to just  percent in  according to nyiso gold book dataif the expansion is allowed to proceed that number could rise dramatically“clearly under the greenidge cryptocurrency proposal this inefficient fossil fuel plant will be operating at a significantly higher capacity factor resulting in a marked increase in greenhouse gas emissions” irene weiser coordinator of fossil free tompkins wrote to the psc last juneweiser warned that greenidge could be the first of host of new air emission threats given that “multiple data center projects are being proposed at old power plant sites in upstate new york each with significant load projections”data centers are needed by multiple industries and do not necessarily involve bitcoin but mining the cryptocurrency is especially attractive today given its skyrocketing pricethe greenidge team told potential investors last month that the plant had mined  bitcoins at an average net cost of about  for the  months ending in february at this week’s bitcoin price that would translate into a profit margin of about  per mined coingreenidge is currently seeking local approval to build four buildings adjacent to the plant which would house new mining machineswhen the trustees of the village of watkins glen considered a resolution in support of a moratorium on expanding the bitcoin operation in dresden last week the manager of the plant dale irwin told them that the authors of the resolution had “zero credibility” and that “there is zero evidence that the facility affects the air quality in the region”in albany’s timesunion newspaper greenidge recently won notice as “a model for innovation” in an opinion column by gavin donohue executive director of the independent power producers of new yorkdonohue another of the  members of the state’s policyshaping climate action council noted that the plant will continue to supply some power to the grid even as an increasing share of its generated power goes to process bitcoin he wrote that the plant has “demonstrated to other generators the possibilities that exist for them in the  economy”donohue declined to respond to emailed questionswhether greenidge’s model can be reproduced at other fossil fuel plants in new york may depend not only on dec air emission decisions but also on how the public service commission regulates “behindthemeter” energy produced by power plantsdespite stiff public opposition the psc granted greenidge a certificate of public convenience and necessity to sell generated power on the grid in  opponents had said there was not enough market demand for energy to justify the restart of an emissionsproducing fossil fuel plant last summer the psc voted unanimously to rule that greenidge’s bitcoin operation was outside its jurisdiction because the energy it used never reached the gridjohn b howard interim chair of the psc and another member of the climate action council voted for the  ruling but also offered a warning that the case may set a dangerous precedent “highload data servers running on fossil generation i don’t think is a very good longterm play” he said at the timeas greenidge seeks a local permit to add the four new buildings to house bitcoin processing servers the dec has allowed the planning board of the town of torrey population  to conduct the environmental reviewby declining to exercise its legal right to step in as lead agency in the environmental review it acquiesced to the decision by torrey officials to skip an environmental impact statement—again in their recent letter to the governor and dec officials earthjustice and the sierra club called for an environmental impact statement addressing the pending renewals of greenidge’s air permitsmeanwhile the committee to preserve the finger lakes has sent letters to cuomo signed by several hundred businesses and individuals protesting greenidge’s “reckless” bitcoin mining operationlast september the group asked dec to suspend revise or revoke greenidge’s permits the dec rejected the request a month later stating that “the facility is in compliance with the terms and conditions in all permits”the dec has never analyzed for a greenidge permit whether the plant’s daily discharges of tens of millions of gallons of warmed water tend to promote toxic algal bloomstests have shown several blooms near dresden including five that exceeded the dec’s threshold for “high toxin” in irwin the plant manager has repeatedly denied any link between the plant’s warmed water and the blooms but gregory boyer a biochemist at sunyesf and an expert in algal blooms has stated in sworn affidavits that warmed waters from the plant are likely to increase the chance of blooms in seneca lake around dresdenthe dec argued in legal briefs that a judge should discount boyer’s affidavit on the grounds that it was not filed on time last year dec discontinued its statewide funding of toxicity tests for suspected algal blooms
