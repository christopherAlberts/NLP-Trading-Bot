given the current trends in bitcoin mining chinese researchers estimate that the energy consumption from this process in their country alone will peak in  at  twh terawatthours and generate  million metric tons of carbon emissionas bitcoin attracted considerable amount of attention in recent years its underlying core mechanism namely blockchain technology has also quickly gained popularitydue to its key characteristics such as decentralization auditability and anonymity blockchain is widely regarded as one of the most promising and attractive technologies for a variety of industries such as supply chain finance production operations management logistics management and the internet of thingsdespite its promises and attractiveness mining bitcoin requires constantly expending andor expanding computer processing power which is associated with increasing energy consumptionin new research dr shouyang wang from the university of chinese academy of sciences and colleagues investigated carbon emission flows of bitcoin blockchain operation in china using a simulationbased bitcoin blockchain carbon emission modelthey found that without any policy interventions the annual energy consumption of the bitcoin blockchain in china will peak in  at  twh and generate  million metric tons of carbon emissionthese amounts exceed the entire annual greenhouse gas emissions outputs of entire midsized countries such as the czech republic and qatar“policy interventions are critical to reduce these impacts” the researchers said“feeding different scenarios into the model however we found that current policies like carbon taxation are not effective at curbing emissions from the bitcoin industry”“instead we found that individual site regulation policies for bitcoin miners represent the best way to alter the current energy consumption structure and reduce future emissions from the blockchain operation”a paper on the findings was published in the journal nature communicationss jiang et al  policy assessments for the carbon emission flows and sustainability of bitcoin blockchain operation in china nat commun   doi
