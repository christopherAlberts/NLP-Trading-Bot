economies booked their worst falls since the global financial crisis with bitcoin now leaving gold in its wake this year will it become the favoured hedge of the futurehaving limited correlation with other asset classes bitcoin joined gold in acting as a diversifying asset for investors seeking opportunities during a time of uncertaintynow sitting at a valuation almost ten times the level of where it was  months ago it would be hard to deny that volatility in the ‘old economy’ had not worked in the crypto’s favour“all other traditional asset classes are getting more and more correlated during downturns” tancredi cordero founder and ceo of kuros associates said at etf stream’s big call thematic etfs event “even when growth equities had their recent downturn this did not directly correlate in bitcoin and this showed its potential diversification benefits”with bitcoin posting uncharacteristically steady growth during the first eight months of the pandemic the asset’s value shot up during the final two months of  as discussion of institutional involvement provided a strong basis of validation in fact whale wallets – those holding more than  bitcoins – bought  tokens during the final week of december aloneas well as offering a source of support for valuation spikes talk of professional backing helped bring bitcoin into the mainstream news cycle and emboldened those making comparisons to goldalongside its role in portfolios during the pandemic bitcoin also shares some inherent characteristics with the yellow metalfor instance both enjoy strong liquidity and benefit from their status as finite commodities this second quality is what enables them to act as a hedge – with their scarcity allowing their values to remain at least roughly steady even as inflationary pressures mount amid widespread money printingdigital and physical pickaxes cut different shapeswhile sharing gold’s role as a hedge to broad disruption it is important not to mistake the main source of bitcoins recent momentum whereas gold consistently observes the pattern of ticking upwards when cyclical equities suffer investors should view the pandemic economic cycle as more of a catalyst than a primary cause of bitcoin’s current surgethough bitcoin certainly shared gold’s role as a hedge during  the main thing the pandemic achieved was bringing the crypto back into the public spotlight from there news cycle prominence – including coverage of professional backing and a sizeable investment by tesla – and investor belief have been the key drivers behind bitcoin’s current valuationin fact completely undermining the volatility hedge narrative the majority of bitcoin’s price gains have been made since pfizer’s vaccine results sparked hopes of an economic recovery last novemberanaelle ubaldino head of etf research and investment advisory at trackinsight said “currently the status of bitcoin as a safe haven is not generally accepted“investors fleeing stocks are not turning to bitcoin as much as to gold so normality returning in the stock market is likely to have less of an impact on the price of bitcoin than on gold”further illustrating this departure from the economic contrarianism of gold bitcoin exchange traded products etps collected  in new assets during   meanwhile gold etps saw a  asset exodus according to data from trackinsightoverall the average

gox crypto exchange in there are also fears that the significance of initial institutional involvement has been overstatedas said by jpmorgan in a report at the start of the year “we believe that a significant component of last year’s institutional flows into bitcoin reflect speculative investors seeking to front run other more realmoney institutional investors”supporting this two of the most popular mechanisms used by institutions to track bitcoin’s performance were funds and futures contractsof those investing in funds the largest holder of the popular grayscale bitcoin trust gbtc at the time of the jpm report’s publication was the ark next generation internet etf arkw – a speculative strategy betting on disruptorslikewise coinciding with the start of bitcoin’s recent bull run the number of bitcoin futures multiplied by a factor of four between the start of november and the end of january“the frothy positioning in bitcoin futures is one manifestation of this speculative institutional flow” the jpm report added “indeed bitcoin futures the preferred vehicle of speculative investors saw a sharp increase in open interest”what does bitcoin offerstill more established with retail and millennial investors bitcoin may well offer a hedge during periods of uncertainty but its role is far more nuanced than just being ‘virtual gold’for one the crypto’s price is far more volatile than that of gold and its forecast is less clear indeed at the same time as jpmorgan’s gauges of ‘mean reversion’ for the asset were at record highs the company also had a bitcoin target
