so it’s no wonder investors have been licking their lips at the prospect of the crypto exchange’s wall street flotation but there are no guarantees in this gamethe reality is that coinbase’s prospects are quite uncertain and its staggering first quarter profits are the direct result of external factors — namely a booming cryptocurrency market coinbase charges  in fees for any trades on its platform and experienced  billion in trading volume in the first quarter of  as cryptocurrencies like bitcoin soared to new alltime highs this essentially means that of the  billion in revenue it collected  billion was the direct result of the bullish crypto market conditions should the crypto bull run come to an end so too will coinbase’s staggering profits there is also the threat of other exchanges

meeting the future profit expectations that are baked into its ridiculously high expected valuation of  billion” the report argues that given how young the cryptocurrency markets are it should be expected that more companies will compete for coinbase’s customers and eat into its market share in the very near futurethe new constructs report also argues that in order to justify the  billion

shambles watching helplessly as exchange after exchange delisted their token in fear of repercussions should the sec win its lawsuit but recent court victories won by ripple and its executives now have the government on the defensive sec counsel dugan bliss has even complained during the proceedings that defendant ripple was trying to put the sec “on trial” and that “the actions of the promoter are what need to be the focus here”during a discovery hearing earlier this month ripple was granted access to the sec’s internal documents on cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ethereum this will enable

portfolios appears to be a bit of a backward step the move appears to run counter to the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by other large banks such as goldman sachs and morgan stanley which are now making concerted efforts to offer their clients more opportunities for exposure to the emerging digital asset class morgan stanley even now directly owns a  stake in microstrategybut the move should really not come as a surprise given the giant european bank’s policy of not processing cryptocurrency payments or allowing customers to bank money from digital wallets microstrategy’s share
