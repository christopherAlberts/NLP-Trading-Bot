the us economy’s kshaped recovery is under way those with stable fulltime jobs benefits and a financial cushion are faring well as stock markets climb to new highs those who are unemployed or partially employed in lowvalueadded bluecollar and service jobs – the new “precariat” – are saddled with debt have little financial wealth and face diminishing economic prospectsthese trends indicate a growing disconnect between wall street and main street the new stock market highs mean nothing to most people the bottom  of the wealth distribution holds just  of total equity market assets whereas the top  commands  and the top  holds  the  richest people have as much wealth as the  million people at the bottomrising inequality has followed the ascent of “big tech” as many as three retail jobs are lost for every job that amazon creates and similar dynamics hold true in other sectors dominated by tech giants but today’s social and economic stresses are not new for decades strapped workers have not been able to keep up with the joneses owing to the stagnation of real inflationadjusted median income alongside rising costs of living and spending expectationsfor decades the “solution” to this problem was to “democratise” finance so that poor and struggling households could borrow more to buy homes they couldn’t afford and then use those homes as cash machines this expansion of consumer credit – mortgages and other debt – resulted in a bubble that ended with the  financial crisis when millions lost their jobs homes and savingsnow the same millennials who were shafted over a decade ago are being duped again workers who rely on gig parttime or freelance “employment” are being offered a new rope with which to hang themselves in the name of “financial democratization” millions have opened accounts on robinhood and other investment apps where they can leverage their scant savings and incomes several times over to speculate on worthless stocksthe recent gamestop narrative featuring a united front of heroic small day traders fighting evil shortselling hedge funds masks the ugly reality that a cohort of hopeless jobless skillless debtburdened individuals is being exploited once again many have been convinced that financial success lies not in good jobs hard work and patient saving and investment but in getrichquick schemes and wagers on inherently worthless assets such as cryptocurrencies or “shitcoins” as i prefer to call themmake no mistake the populist meme in which an army of millennial davids takes down a wall street goliath is merely serving another scheme to fleece clueless amateur investors as in  the inevitable result will be another asset bubble the difference is that this time recklessly populist members of congress have taken to inveighing against financial intermediaries for not permitting the vulnerable to leverage themselves even moremaking matters worse markets are starting to worry about the massive experiment in budgetdeficit monetisation being carried out by the us federal reserve and department of the treasury through quantitative easing a form of modern monetary theory or “helicopter money” a growing chorus of critics warns that this approach could overheat the economy forcing the fed to hike interest rates sooner than expected nominal and real bond yields are already rising and this has shaken risky assets such as equities owing to these concerns about a fedled taper tantrum a recovery that was supposed to be good for markets is now giving way to a market correctionmeanwhile congressional democrats are moving ahead with a  rescue package that will include additional direct support to households but with millions already in arrears on rent and utilities payments or in moratoria on their mortgages credit cards and other loans a significant share of these disbursements will go toward debt repayment and saving with only around onethird of the stimulus likely to be translated into actual spendingthis implies that the package’s effects on growth inflation and bond yields will be smaller than expected and because the additional savings will end up being funneled back into purchases of government bonds what was meant to be a bailout for strapped households will in effect become a bailout for banks and other lendersto be sure inflation may eventually still emerge if the effects of monetized fiscal deficits combine with negative supply shocks to produce stagflation the risk of such shocks has risen as a result of the new sinoamerican cold war which threatens to trigger a process of deglobalization and economic balkanisation as countries pursue renewed protectionism and the reshoring of investments and manufacturing operations but this is a story for the medium term not for when it comes to this year growth may yet fall short of expectations new strains of the coronavirus continue to emerge raising concerns that existing vaccines may no longer be sufficient to end the pandemic repeated stopgo cycles undermine confidence and political pressure to reopen the economy before the virus is contained will continue to build many small and mediumsize enterprises are still at risk of going bust and far too many people are facing the prospects of longterm unemployment the list of pathologies afflicting the economy is long and includes rising inequality deleveraging by debtburdened firms and workers and political and geopolitical risksasset markets remain frothy – if not outright bubbly – because they are being fed by superaccommodative monetary policies but today’s priceearnings ratios are as high they were in the bubbles preceding the busts of  and  between everrising leverage and the potential for bubbles in specialpurpose acquisition companies tech stocks and cryptocurrencies today’s market mania offers plenty of cause for concernunder these conditions the fed is probably worried that markets will instantly crash if it takes away the punch bowl and with the increase in public and private debt preventing the eventual monetary normalization the likelihood of stagflation in the medium term – and a hard landing for asset markets and economies – continues
