if you are reading this article you are using electricity the same goes for every google search email sent and photo saved to the cloud as our lives go digital we need more electricity to power those lives yet there is one digital outlier that keeps getting a lot of attention bitcoinfor something that doesnt physically exist bitcoin really captivates the imagination and needs a lot of electric power to keep going thats according to an ongoing study by the university of cambridges bitcoin electricity consumption index they calculate that in one year the machines behind the cryptocurrency require more power than the netherlands a country with over  million inhabitantsas the value of bitcoin has skyrocketed recently to over  € so has the need for electric power to run itbitcoin supporters say this is ok since it is creating an entirely new financial system free of government interference mining gold and printing money too cost a lot to produce transport and keep safe meanwhile todays financial system with its digital platforms and offices uses lots of energy toohow much power does bitcoin needundisputed numbers are hard to come by because of the complex nature of the calculations back at the start of  bitcoin was using  terawatthours of power a year in october  that was up to  terawatthours now a few months later it has nearly doubled to  terawatthours the cambridge researchers found enough to run their entire university for nearly  yearsby these same calculations if bitcoin were a country only  other countries would use more electricity it would surpass the yearly power needs of the uae the netherlands the philippines belgium austria or israeldutch economist alex de vries is a bit more conservative and thinks bitcoin uses  terawatthours of power a year he has also been following the situation for years and publishes his research on digiconomists bitcoin energy consumption indextoday all data centers globally — the ones that run big tech the cloud the internet and the current financial system — need around  terawatthours of electricity a year according to de vries at the moment the bitcoin network consumes about half this amount he told dwby comparison one bitcoin transaction had the same energy footprint as  visa transactions in  now a single bitcoin transaction uses the same electricity to run  visa transactions according to numbers on digiconomist a website dedicated to exposing the unintended consequences of digital trendswhy does bitcoin need energy at allbitcoin is a virtual cryptocurrency basically that means it is run by a massive peertopeer computer network to keep track of everything and to keep the network safe it uses a ledger system called blockchain this records all transactions and everyone in the network gets a copy and each copy is linked to each other since everything is interconnected the hope is that tampering with the system is impossibleanyone can become a part of the network they just need to have a highpowered purposebuilt computer the more powerful the better these computers solve increasingly difficult math problems to keep it all going to avoid overheating the busy machines must be kept coolelon musk bitcoins most famous investorthe people running these computers often called miners dont get paid per se but have the chance of being rewarded with bitcoin the more computing power they have the higher their chances of getting some when the price of bitcoin goes up it makes investing in more technology attractive its an upward spiral as more computers are addedthe higher the price the more miners will earn and the bigger the incentive to add more machines to the network said de vries adding that usage is also important because the network can only process five transactions per second it quickly gets more expensive to use bitcoin if a lot of people try to do so since transaction fees also go to the miners this also drives miner earnings and ultimately energy consumptionwhere are the bitcoin minerscurrently over  of bitcoin miners are in china followed by the us and russia both with around  according to the researchers at cambridgein china they can get cheap excesses of hydropower in the summer and take advantage of cheap coalbased power in the winter de vries told dw since they still have to move seasonally within china to optimally benefit from this weve recently seen countries like iran and kazakhstan gain popularitycritics see this as a big problem many countries have unstable power grids and some cannot handle the increased needs in january the iranian government blamed bitcoin mining for power outages in the country on top of that there is the giant  footprint of all that electricity productionthough bitcoins environmental damage is so far only a tiny fraction of what cars and industry produce these ecological concerns have pushed many miners away from coal power to places with cheaper hydroelectric power and despite most concerns the cryptocurrency still has a big fan base most famous among them teslas elon muskbitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency on the block though understudied cryptocurrencies added  on top of bitcoins energy needs last year according to de vries some use a similar mining technique to bitcoin others use alternatives in which the block creation process depends on wealth rather than computational power theoretically this modification could also be implemented in bitcoin and would remove any incentive to use specialized mining hardware saving both energy and electronic waste he concluded
