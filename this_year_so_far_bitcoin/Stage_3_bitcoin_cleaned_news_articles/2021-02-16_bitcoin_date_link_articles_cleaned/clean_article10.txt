ethereum is similar to bitcoin in the sense that they are both cryptocurrencies  noncentrally issued digital currencies another similarity between the two is that the both operate using the proofofwork consensus this means that for both ethereum and bitcoin the verification and confirmation of transactions requires a networkwide consensus of nodes due to this condition both of them are slow when it comes to transaction processingethereum is slightly faster than bitcoin it normally processes  transactions per second while bitcoin processes  at least this is true for the current version of ethereum one of the big expectations in the market right now is that the upcoming  upgrade will provide faster transactions among other thingsbut the major point that separates ethereum from bitcoin are smart contracts – the term most closely associated with ethereum blockchain smart contracts are digital contracts that have a variety of applicationswithout going too far from the topic of ethereum  it makes sense to mention beacon chain that is used to provide an upgrade to ethereum’s features beacon chain makes use of a proofofstake consensus algorithm rather than proofofwork – this means that it uses tokens instead of traditional computational power in order to process transactionsbeacon chain employs shardchains smaller groups of nodes that process their own portions of transactions in parallel without needing to achieve a consensus across the entire network this is meant to improve ethereum’s scalability and vastly increase its throughput rate at cexio we expect that the ethereum  throughput rate will be able to reach  transactions per second allowing ethereum to match any centralized payment system in transaction processing speedin terms of price stability it is clear that bitcoin has a lead over ethereum btc rate is a major point in defining the entire cryptocurrency market picture and the two are positively correlated  when bitcoin rises or falls the same happens to ethereum and bitcoin has an around four times higher market capitalization therefore it is less unstable in its price actionas far as the trading of both assets is concerned at cexio we observed that in december  ethusd trading volumes grew by  while btcusd grew by  we believe that it may represent a psychological trait for users – due to the rally btc became too expensive to fund trading strategies with too risky to trade this also indicates that ethereum is no longer following bitcoin’s price fluctuations as closely as it used to and this divergence may become more apparent in the future
