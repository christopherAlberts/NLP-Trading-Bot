the price of one bitcoin briefly rose above  on tuesday morning to set a new record by noon eastern time the price had fallen to around bitcoins price is now far above the previous peak of  reached in december  bitcoins value has risen by almost  percent since the start of no single factor seems to be driving the cryptocurrencys rise instead the price is rising as more and more mainstream organizations are deciding to treat it as an ordinary investment asset an important milestone came last week when bank of new york mellon announced that it plans to begin holding bitcoin on behalf of clientsbny mellon is one of the worlds largest custodian banks—a bank that takes custody of stocks bonds precious metals and other assets on behalf of large clients by adding bitcoin to this list bny mellon will give anyone who wants to invest in bitcoin a way to do so that is widely recognized as lowriskthats important because traditionally holding bitcoin has been quite risky ownership of bitcoin is determined by control of a corresponding private key anyone who gets a copy of a private key—from hackers to burglars—can steal the bitcoins if the owner loses the private key to a fire or hard drive failure the bitcoin is lost forever because the bitcoin network is fully decentralized owners have no recourse if their bitcoins are lost or stolen—a fact that has given rise to many hardluck storiesbanks like bny mellon are experts at securely storing valuable assets as they begin offering bitcoin storage services holding bitcoins will become no different from holding any other asset that could coax even more wealthy investors to park some of their wealth in bitcoinadvertisementmore and more companies are investing in bitcoinone mainstream company that has jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon is enterprise software company microstrategy which began buying millions of dollars of bitcoin last year today the company has at least  bitcoins—worth  billion at current prices that represents more than a third of the companys market capitalizationthe company recently announced plans to issue  million in debt to buy still more bitcoins and its ceo has encouraged other ceos to follow his lead last week tesla announced that it had bought  billion in bitcoin and was planning to accept bitcoin payments for its carsin short the same flywheel that has pushed bitcoin upward for the last  years is continuing to spin as the cryptocurrencys value rises more people buy it which attracts more attention and inspires still more people to buy itsome people believed that this process had played itself out at the peak of the last bitcoin boom in  or for that matter the one before that in  but while almost everyone had heard of bitcoin by late  a lot of mainstream institutions were still wary of putting substantial wealth into the virtual currencynow that resistance seems to be melting theres obviously still a risk that bitcoins value could plunge as it has on several previous occasions but a growing number of investors are seeing it as just another type of asset to include in a diversified portfolio—alongside stocks bonds real estate precious metals and so forth and if a lot of people make the same judgment in the coming months and years bitcoins value could rise furthereven colorful cnbc personality jim cramer recently said he had begun holding bitcoin i think it’s almost irresponsible not to include” bitcoin in an investment portfolio he added its worth noting that cramer once advised viewers not to sell bear stearns stock shortly before the firms  collapse so his pronouncements should be taken with a grain of saltbitcoins value could also plunge in the year after bitcoin reached its previous peak in december  bitcoin fell by more than  percent—from  to  holding bitcoin remains an extremely risky proposition and people shouldnt put any more money into bitcoin than they can afford to lose
