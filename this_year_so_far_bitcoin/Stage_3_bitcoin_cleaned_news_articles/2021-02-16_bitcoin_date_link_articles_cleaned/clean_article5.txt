there’s been renewed interest in bitcoin exchangetraded funds etfs with the nomination of gary gensler to head the securities and exchange commission and the approval of a true canadian bitcoin etf whether one gets approved in the us is still unclearyoure reading state of crypto a coindesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government click here to sign up for future editionswhen etfthe narrativethe big news last week was the ontario securities commission approved north america’s first bitcoin etf in canada an etf which is essentially a retailfriendly regulated bitcoin investment vehicle that can trade in popular brokerage apps has long been a product the industry has wanted numerous applications have been rejected in the us but the approval of one in canada could be an early sign that we’ll soon see something similar in the stateswhy it mattersbasically the idea is a bitcoin etf would provide everyday investors withbitcoin exposure through existing retail trading apps such as td ameritrade but these traders would not actually need to buy bitcoinin short an etfwould let people invest in bitcoin without having to set up a wallet or trust in an exchange that might go down when market volatility risesthere are also those who believe an etf would help spark or continue a bull run but considering elon musk can pretty much just do that on his own now i’m not so sure an etf seems as necessary as it did in breaking it downthe crypto market has matured since  and  when the us securities and exchange commission sec was rejecting etf applications left and rightmatthew hougan the chief investment officer at bitwise asset management a firm that’s gone to great lengths to get a bitcoin etf approved told coindesk that the futures market tied to cryptocurrencies has grown significantly the underlying spot markets are functioning better and the us regulatory structure has evolved but is that enoughthe main question is whether the market has matured enough to meet the requirements listed under the securities exchange act the federal law that oversees securities trading within the usark investment management ceo cathie wood recently told an audience she thinks the bitcoin market might need to see  trillion in demand before the sec is comfortable with an etfhougan isn’t so sure saying he thinks bitcoin’s futures market is comparable to hard wheat in size hard wheat has both a futures market and etfs which is more than you can say for onionsgary genslersome of the thinking about whether or not to file a bitcoin etf application involves the new administration and the nomination of gary gensler as sec chair gensler a longtime crypto advocate who’s perhaps best known for his work on derivatives regulation at the commodity futures trading commission after the last financial crisis is expected to be fairly cryptofriendly at least to the degree of approving an etf still questions remain“it’s certainly too early to say what his view will be on crypto whether it will be a priority what that will do to influence the market and i think that may even be a premature conversation” hougan saidat the least while gensler may be interested in crypto it’s not likely to be a priority given many of the other issues he’ll have to address including likely having to form a response to the market volatility seen last month with the gamestop stock pumpthe better question is what has changed over the past two yearsaccording to hougan the factors that would support an etf approval includemarket efficiency has increasedregulatory oversight has evolvednew custody solutions have entered the market andthere are better audit processeshowever the sec has used various objections in rejecting past etf applications the outstanding questions includewhether the sec’s market surveillance questions have been answered andwhether the sec’s market manipulation questions have been answered“the market has gotten better and so the question you’re left with is ‘do we know enough’ and ‘has the market gotten better enough’ and we just don’t know” hougan saidcanadaone positive sign for the industry is last week’s approval of an openended etf in canada to be clear it’s not the first fund to trade in canada  launched a bitcoin fund last year however this is the first etf that will trade on a retailaccessible exchange – the toronto stock exchange – within north americaeric balchunas a senior etf analyst at bloomberg said on twitter the “us usually follows shortly after” canadian regulators in approving such products calling the approval a “good sign” for american applicantshis guess late september is when we’ll see the approval and it could see  billion in inflows over its first yearhere’s what needs to happena company has to file for an etf by filing a form  two companies have filed for an etf recently vaneck and valkyrie however neither has filed a  form which would kick off the sec review processonce someone does file the  form however the sec has to acknowledge it’s reviewing it this kicks off a  review periodthe sec can say it needs more time andor provide feedback the agency can extend the review period up to  days  days from today would be oct the sec staff would decide whether or not to approve the application and then the five commissioners would agree or disagree as the case may beat some point the sec would have to approve or reject the applicationif the application is approved congratulations to the issuer and to the next big thing that everyone will get excited aboutif the application is denied a commissioner or applicant could request a review of the decision this happened to nine etf applications that were rejected simultaneously in  i still have no idea what the resolution wascome to think of it the sec also reviewed a bitwise application that was rejected the company later withdrew that particular applicationso in short while there are positive signs for an etf approval in  nothing is guaranteedsec lawsuitsin other unrelated news last week acting sec chair allison herren lee published a statement ending the contingent settlement offers that could lead to the faster resolution of sec cases this means that cases could drag on longer for crypto companies that get caught in the sec crosshairs here’s looking at you ripplethe statement said the agency’s division of enforcement will no longer recommend settlements that are contingent on whether or not a company receives a waiver to act as a wellknown seasoned issuer wksithese waivers had perks in the past they could be used as part of a settlement offer if the sec was suing a company on securities law violationsin other words if the sec division of enforcement is suing a company say a hypothetical cryptocurrencyrelated firm for alleged violations of the law a settlement could have been contingent on the firm receiving wksi status this condition helped companies know what their penalties would be in a settlement and what they could do postlitigationlee said this leads to a potential conflict between the sec’s different divisionsthis new policy would appear to lessen the chances of such settlements occuring in futurecommissioners hester peirce and elad roisman pushed back against the move in a dissenting statement writing that the previous policy didn’t lead to any structural conflictscompanies may be less willing to pursue settlements if they don’t know whether they’ll receive waivers to continue operating they wrote warning that this could lead to more time and therefore resources spent pursuing casesit remains to be seen what incoming chair gary gensler will do by the way – i’ll be talking about this case during a virtual panel hosted by the new york financial writers’ association next tuesday at  pm et come check it outbidens rulehonestly not a whole lot has happened in the past week no new nominations no confirmation hearings scheduled yet

that because taxes are weird tesla has to report any potential loss in the value of the  billion in crypto it bought last month even if it hasn’t actually sold the bitcoin should the holdings’ value decline before its next earnings report according to bloomberg however should the bitcoin’s value increase tesla cannot report that this is because us tax standardssetters the financial accounting standards board haven’t created any specific guidance around digital currencies probably wouldn’t hurt if they did though bloomberg tax reports that’s not likely to happen anytime sooncanadian woman
