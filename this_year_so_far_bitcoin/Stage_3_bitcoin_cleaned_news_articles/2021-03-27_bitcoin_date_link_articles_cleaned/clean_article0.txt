when it comes to bitcoin the question on everyone’s mind is usually “will the price go up”celebrity investors like chamath palihapitiya and mike novogratz tell anyone who is willing to listen that bitcoin will inevitably exceed  per unit in value other bitcoin advocates claim the price is rising “to infinity” — or a global market cap of  trillion it’s a popular message signaling to people they can get rich merely by buying and holding on to something that banks and governments don’t control for enough time for the price to risealthough i generally avoid this topic i’m not a financial expert nor a fortuneteller but it’s time to finally give the people what they want will bitcoin ever hit  here’s what you need to knowthe  on bitcoin pricesbitcoin’s price tends to rise in fouryear cyclesbitcoin’s price varies across different marketsbitcoin is an experimental software project so it is a very risky investmentanyone who claims to know any cryptocurrency’s future value is lying either to you or to themselveswill bitcoin reach shutterstockyes in my uneducated opinion it’s quite likely that the dollardenominated price of bitcoin will eventually reach  let me explain my reasoning behind that forecastit is not because as advocates often claim it is “inevitable” that bitcoin will become the world’s next reserve currency dethroning the american dollar rather from my perspective there are now too many wealthy and powerful people invested in bitcoin for the crypto circus to stop short of  even if that valuation isn’t sustainable in the long run regardless of whether bitcoin continues to serve as censorshipresistant money which it does for a minority of users there will still be people who benefit from selling that narrative to increase the value of their own holdingsstepping back bitcoin’s price tends to skyrocket in repetitive fouryear cycles anyone who purchased bitcoin and held onto it for at least four years witnessed shockingly high appreciation no matter what price they bought it at for example the price went from roughly  in december  to more than  by december  the way this cycle seems to work is that the price reaches new alltime highs for several months then plummets to half the price as the hype cycle corrects itself and the skeptical newbies drawn by the promise of riskfree riches cash out people who gained lifechanging amounts of wealth from bitcoin rarely did it quickly it required patienceyou may have noticed i keep saying “dollardenominated value” since one bitcoin today is still just one bitcoin from years past someone may sell a single bitcoin for  or  the most recent high in  but ultimately the “value” of bitcoin is determined by supply and demand not the american federal reserve bitcoin routinely sells at a premium in places like south korea argentina and hong kong and prices have more to do with local politics than with the american dollar bitcoin is worth whatever the buyer is willing to pay for it across asset classeswe may someday say assets are worth  satoshis tiny fractions of bitcoin rather than dollars as the unit of account it’s impossible to predict how many dollars bitcoin would be worth in that context since we’ve seen the fiat price of bitcoin double several times over the past decade it seems reasonable to expect it to double at least once more in the futurewhy the price of bitcoin will keep going upshutterstockit would be more surprising for the decadelong cycles to abruptly cease than for the bull market cycles to continue for at least a few more years it won’t all end within a day or a week some people incorrectly compare the bitcoin market to the infamous “tulip mania” that gripped the netherlands from  — the world’s first major economic boomandbust bitcoin has been through multiple hype cycles over the last decade and there are still more than a million crypto wallet accounts using bitcoin every day this experimental software project may not be the utopian revolution that some salesmen promise but it is certainly more than a fadultimately the price of bitcoin will probably continue to rise following the same oscillating pattern no one can accurately predict the market value will remain high or say when it will drop buy bitcoin at your own risk if nothing else aside from digital riches tumbling down the bitcoin rabbit hole tends to be a lot of funfor more raw and brutally honest insights from someone who actually uses cryptocurrency be sure to check out my substack and follow me on instagram at leighcuen
