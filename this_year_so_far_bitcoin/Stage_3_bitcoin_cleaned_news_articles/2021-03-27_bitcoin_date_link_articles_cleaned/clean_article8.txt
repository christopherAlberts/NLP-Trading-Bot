university estimates that  per cent of that energy comes from renewable sources like hydro solar or wind — in other words most of it does notbitfarms president geoffrey morphy said that’s why quebec is a sustainable choice for miners with its abundance of renewable energy primarily coming from hydroelectric dams“in terms of electricity our largest input is done with renewable energy and then our output being heat” he said“we’re looking for value chain opportunities there where we can actually sell or use our heat as a byproduct for other businesses such as greenhouses pulp and paper things like that”morphy said the company is currently in talks with a tomato grower to set up an operation beside one of the bitfarms’ warehousesstory continues below advertisementhe also said bitfarms is looking at setting up a site in south america where the power source would be natural gas“if we were to develop that site then we would make sure that it’s using the cleanest burning highcapacity highly efficient turbines that are possible to produce it with the appropriate environmental controls on it” morphy said“we know the world is evolving very quickly to having to deal with carbon credits and carbon offsets and really heading for a netzero type of approach so we’re very mindful of that”the greener blockchainhowever some experts believe blockchain technology a type of digital ledger technology or dlt could help tackle climate change rather than contribute to itto understand how and why you need to get your head around how blockchain worksput very simply it is a database of transactions and rules but instead of it being held in one central location it is replicated on a “distributed network” of member computersnothing can happen on the network unless a majority of participants agree on the change and no existing data can be changed — only new data can be addedthose features aim to ensure security and transparencystory continues below advertisementapart from

newsalex tapscott is one of the leading advocates of blockchain in canada and cowrote the book blockchain revolution with his father don tapscott“what blockchain basically enables is digital scarcity — a way to move a unique digital asset over the internet peer to peer to somebody else without the need for a traditional third party like a bank or a government and that might seem like a simple innovation but it’s profound” tapscott saidhe said one of the most promising areas is that of “smart contracts” in which blockchain would automatically look after the security financial and legal aspects of a contractstory continues below advertisement“all that is is a piece of software that mimics the logic of a contract or a business agreement so basically you could put the deposit money into a digital escrow inside of a smart contract wait for the conditions of the transaction to clear at which point the transaction would become irrevocable just written in code” tapscott saidand that

projects like treeplanting efforts or carbon trading schemes between governments and within the private sector could be efficiently securely and transparently monitored using blockchain“monitoring reporting and verification mrv is an essential part of many of these sustainable markets because it’s really where you distinguish those that are ‘greenwashing’ those who say that they are sustainable but in reality when you look at the details they are not and there blockchain actually can play a huge role with this part of being a distributor database” baiz saidstory continues below

the world … barely have two or three hectares of land” he said“so they will never benefit will never fit under these conditions on getting carbon credits and support for more sustainable farming practices because they won’t be able to afford all the very different verifiability costs”on the larger end of the scale if national participants in a worldwide carbon trading scheme were all part of
