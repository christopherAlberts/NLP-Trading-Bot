the next time someone smugly tells you there is “no legitimate use case” for cryptocurrency or asserts that it has “no redeeming social value” shove this story in his or her facemeduza a russian news outlet is soliciting donations in cryptocurrency along with traditional payment methods after the government labeled it a “foreign agent” coindesk’s ontheground correspondent anna baydakova reported thursdaythis article is excerpted from the node coindesks daily roundup of the most pivotal stories on cryptocurrency and the future of money you can subscribe to get the full newsletter heremeduza is now required by law to post a notice of its “foreign agent” status in a typeface bigger than the text of its articles as a result of this scarlet letter meduza lost many of its advertisers and is running out of money the team behind the publication said apparently it hasn’t been deplatformed by traditional financial institutions because it is also taking donations by bank card and paypal but the reasons meduza gave for including the crypto option were telling“if people are afraid to send us money from their bank accounts and they might well be they can send us crypto” said meduza’s editorinchief ivan kolpakova skeptic might note that donors who send bitcoin btc ether eth or bnb to meduza would leave a permanent record of their actions on the blockchains or public ledgers of these assets but such a record would show only the address a randomseeming string of numbers and letters that sent the money not the person behind it an address may or may not be tied to donors’ realworld identity depending on how they acquired the crypto and what steps they took to protect their privacy whereas their bank and paypal accounts definitely arethe age of weaponized bankingfurther if recent history teaches us anything it is that financial intermediaries cannot be relied upon to stand with dissident or unpopular voiceswe saw this more than a decade ago with the blockade of wikileaks by paypal and other large financial institutions that caved to extralegal pressure from us politicianswe see it today when payment processors and crowdfunding sites boot content creators fundraisers or pariahfriendly internet platforms not because they are breaking any laws but because their speech offends activists i too find the content in many of these cases unsavory but i don’t mind that it exists and i don’t want to prevent those who want to read watch or hear it from doing so that’s a basic “smalll liberal” principle or wasto quote a locked twitter account whom i will not name out of respect for the person’s privacy “if i cover my ears because i don’t want to hear from you it’s not censorship if i cover your mouth or someone else’s ears because people want to hear you it’s censorship”i can already hear the bien pensants say “it’s only censorship when the government does it” but even if you accept only that narrow legal definition of the word it surely describes what the russian government – the very regime whose influence in the us many of those same bien pensants spent the last four years hyperventilating about – is trying to do to meduzacrypto might thwart that attempt or at least hinder it by enabling individuals to transfer money to a publisher without permission from third parties that can be strongarmed or politicizeddownsidesby all means let’s talk about the copious amounts of electricity required to secure bitcoin and other proofofstake networks – although describing this intensive computation as “wasteful” is a subjective value judgment tiktok and hair dryers are wasteful in my book should those things be bannedsee also daniel kuhn – bitcoin warts and allby all means let’s pay attention to how terrorists foreign or now we’re told domestic might take advantage of this technology but if we’re going to blame anyone or anything other than the terrorists for their actions remember it was not satoshi nakamoto who destabilized the middle east or hollowed out middle america
