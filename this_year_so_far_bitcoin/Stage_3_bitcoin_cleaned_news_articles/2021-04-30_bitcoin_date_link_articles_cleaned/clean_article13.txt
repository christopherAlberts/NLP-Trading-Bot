in the late  america experienced a dotcom mania in the  the housing market went wildtoday there are manias in everything from bitcoin and nonfungible tokens to spacs and meme stocks – obscure corners of the market that are getting increased attention whether these are the next bubbles to burst remains to be seenthe sudden rise of all these relatively new asset classes – or the astronomical heights they’ve reached – may seem irrational or even enchanted describing them as speculative manias implies that individuals are lost in forces beyond their control and needn’t take responsibility for the actions of the crowdbut as i learned while researching my book “speculation a cultural history from aristotle to ai” which will be published in june  financial speculation hasn’t always been understood as a widespread craze – or even outside of individual choiceadam smith and the rise of financial speculationfrom ancient times until the late  the term “speculation” was used mainly by philosophers scientists and authors to describe conjectures about the future when speaking of traders who manipulated the prices of an asset to make an outsize profit financial writers instead used terms like “engrossing” or “cornering” the marketafter a series of international credit scandals in the  though “speculation” became the favored descriptor for highrisk financial gambling political economist adam smith used the term extensively in “wealth of nations” published in  after seeing it used to describe lotteries and smuggling he saw in it a perfect term for how traders were trying to capitalize exponentially on the inherent risks and unknowns of the futuregeorge washington even warned in  that speculators “are putting the rights  liberties of this country into the most eminent danger”yet smith washington and others still saw speculators of all types as individuals making calculated decisions not as part of some maniacal collective or epidemic contagionalexander hamilton’s ‘scripomania’ takes holdthat began to change thanks largely to the early american physician and thinker benjamin rushas surgeon general of the continental army and a prolific publisher of studies of mental illness rush penned a widely circulated article in  “on the different species of mania” in it he characterized speculative gambling alongside  other types of “manias” that he wrote had become pronounced in american life including “land mania” “horse mania” “machine mania” and “monarchical mania”for rush speculation was a disease of the mind that spread from one to many and threatened the health of a young democracy that relied on rational decisionmaking by voters and politicians the “spirit of speculation” he foresaw was not a goodhearted “spirit” of nation building but rather could “destroy patriotism and friendship in many people”rush’s terminology and his way of thinking caught on quickly in the summer of  “scripomania” took hold as alexander hamilton sold the rights to buy shares – known as scrips for “subscriptions” – in the newfound bank of the united states to shore up the nation’s finances following the revolutionary war demand for the scrips soared the philadelphia general advertiser declared that “an inveterate madness for speculation seems to possess this country”calculated risk – minus the calculationafter that the tie between “speculation” and “mania” spread and became inextricable – and it hasn’t been severed since the scottish journalist charles mackay sealed this connection in  with his influential “extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds” since then virtually every bubble every rush in commodities and every market panic that has ensued has been called a “mania”the term has even been used retrospectively to refer to the behaviors that led to speculative bubbles in the distant past the famous dutch tulip bubble of  for instance was seen in its day as foolish and dangerous but only after mackay’s book was it labeled a “mania”the trouble with talking about wild financial events in this way is that society begins to confuse and distort the responsibility and nature of bubbles that inevitably crash leaving ruin in their waketo speculate at its core is to make a bet about the future based on individual calculations of the risks of tomorrow there’s nothing inherently contagious or mad about it in fact computers are often speculating now in place of human mindswhat we call a “mania” is just shorthand for saying that a lot of people – and machines – made the same bet as happened in january when day traders – many of them inexperienced – drove up the price of gamestop maybe they were all acting rationally and in concert maybe they were duped by insiders or weren’t fully calculating those riskswhatever the explanation using the term “mania” tells us only a small and potentially misleading part of the story
