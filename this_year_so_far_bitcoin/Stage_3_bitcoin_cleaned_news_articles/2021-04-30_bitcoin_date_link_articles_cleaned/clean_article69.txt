the bitcoin price is volatile we all know it “bitcoin is still young” “the hashrate dropped” “tesla is buying” “markets are patterns in nature and we’ve reached a fibonacci level” and so forth explanations may vary but for now bitcoin’s volatility is likely almost always due to our incessant obsession with pricesponsoredsponsoredbitcoin adoption is not simply new users coming into the market to speculate of course it is part of the process which is something satoshi nakamoto anticipated but deep adoption is also about understanding internalizing and taking ownershipaxial transformations in the digital agebeyond iterating the different ways in which bitcoin can be of use to ceos hedge fund managers the unbanked or overseas workers it’s also important to consider how this technology speaks to the particular age we’re in and the wider transformations around us specifically i see bitcoin as signaling a grand transformation of axial proportionssponsoredsponsoredhere ‘axial’ refers to karl jaspers’  famous notion of the axial age a period of time between  and  bce when the basis for the world’s intellectual and religious systems emerged as anthropologist robert bellah observed there are these key periods in history where humanity as a whole unlocks new capacities triggering collective bursts of virtue and innovation across cultural geographiesneedless to say bitcoin is not the instigator this new axial period we’re in did not start in  it has been in full force for over a hundred years at least and bitcoin is a part of ittwo macro trends are worth considering redrawing the commonfew would disagree that despite ongoing conflicts wars and persistent inequality over the past century the world has become increasingly interconnected and reluctantly interdependentadvancements in transportation communication and information technology have altered our notions of time space and belongingthousandyearold monarchies dynasties and empires have crumbled against the rise of nationstates federations and unionsdecolonization the formal abolition of slavery universal suffrage these are large processes that have played and continue to play outnothing is perfect as of yet but on a lower time frame we can see the gradual emergence of a global consciousness paired with a desire for individual sovereignty it’s a way of being that wants to escape categorizations of race religion status gender age politics and so forth and at the same time reinforce a core identitylet’s be fair bitcoin does not directly solve inequality nor does it solve systemic racism or sexual violence however as a decentralized digital currency that no country or central bank can lay claim to or control bitcoin does introduce real ownership financial autonomy and borderlessness to communities and individuals who might historically have not experienced such privileges beforetransitioning – rather than investing – into bitcoin is part of reclaiming one’s identity and agency in a globalized world and while its adoption may be seen as fragmenting society it’s better viewed as a form of creative destruction which allows for a renegotiation and untangling of old power tiestruly owning your wealth as an individual or household is empowering in ways that can really only be understood in the margins of society establishing authenticityalready since the enlightenment humanity has been embroiled in a fierce struggle between traditional and critical thought universal truths and relativism today we find this expressed in the fight against misinformation a deepening mistrust in the systems we inhabit as well as a crumbling of those same bretton woods institutions that were once held in high esteemat the same time there is a tangible insistence on authenticity all around us in its violent form we can see a range of radical movements including fundamentalist and separatist organisations intent on restoring truth and order as they see fit but a similar urge for authenticity is seen in a growing demand for such things as organic food offthegrid or communal living and indeed a desire for sound moneybitcoin does not just offer authenticity in the sense that it is disintermediating or peertopeer in monetary terms against the backdrop of ceaseless money printing bitcoin’s fixed scarcity transparency and permanence offers a trustworthy store of value for individuals communities corporations institutions and eventually central banks some might argue that if bitcoin were to achieve global reserve currency status it would lay the foundation for a fairer more authentic economytransitioning into bitcoinif we take these two macro trends as part of a longterm axial transformation that sees humanity become more mature as a species there is a case to be made for bitcoin to be a part of that futureholding fiat suits an adolescent culture of instant gratification while holding an antiinflationary or deflationary asset such as bitcoin incentivizes postponement some might see this as detrimental to the economy but the argument here is against the culture of decadence and massconsumption and holds that bitcoin actually fosters moderationlikewise as we can hear in the rhetoric of the likes of michael saylor elon musk and across the bitcoin community the nature of bitcoin and its emergence as a new asset class is such that it encourages thinking over longer time frames gold has a similar effect however while gold looks at history bitcoin is forwardlookingin a mature society where there is a balance between rights and responsibilities selfcustody of one’s own wealth makes sense over the course of time we should expect some institutions to fall and others to come in their place bitcoin offers a nonsovereign alternativebut as with all grand transformations there will be new problems and questions to grapple with for example how can bitcoin actually be used to address wealth inequalities in the long run what type of resistance can we expect to encounter as bitcoin sees greater adoption and to a larger extent what does it mean for society to go fully digital and considering the infrastructure  where does power residewhile technical analysis works for traders part of bitcoin’s valuation happens through conversation and debatewhat it really means to transition into bitcoin can hardly be done justice in one article alone but these are the types of conversations that are now unfolding on social media platforms podcasts blogs and across the crypto space and it seems to me that they’re important to continue havingfor this reason i’ll be hosting ‘bitcoin  beyond’ sessions on clubhouse where we can freely discuss some of the deeper questions beyond price our first session starts on
