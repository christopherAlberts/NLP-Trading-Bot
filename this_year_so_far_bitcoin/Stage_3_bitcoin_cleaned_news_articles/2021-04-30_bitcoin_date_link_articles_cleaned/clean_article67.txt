has essentially not gone anywhere since late february so what is going onusing the elliott wave principle ewp combined with technical analysis we can see that btc has likely been in an irregular flat correction since hitting its late february topflat corrections consist of three larger waves one wave down a followed by one wave one up b and a subsequent wave down c they are called “flat” because the instrument is essentially mainly moving sideways it is a typical sideways consolidation pattern after a long runup which shows buyers are still in control but some profittaking is taking place before the next runup kicks inin addition waves a b and c of a flat are made up of smaller waves as well wavea consists of three waves waveb as well but wavec consists of  waves thus in more detail after the runup peaks often a strong  of a  wave the instrument will see a  movelet’s put this ewp to the test see figure  belowfigure  daily bitcoin candlestick chart with ewp count and technical indicatorsbitcoin daily chart with ewp and technical indicatorsbitcoin topped in midfebruary declined into latefebruary then rallied into midapril besides the last week it has been falling since thus this describes a downwave followed by an upwave and now in another down wave the first decline red wavea consisted of three smaller waves green waves a b c from late february into midapril the rally comprised three waves green a b c with the internals of those waves matching typical fibonacciextensions the midapril alltime high was  the length of the february decline a special relationship between wavea and waveb in an irregular flatthe subsequent recent decline to around  consisted of five grey smaller waves thus for now there’s been a  move since the late february high this means two things either the flat correction is over and a run to new aths is under way red path or these smaller five waves are only the start of a more extensive fivewave down sequence green route how do we know which option is operablesimple if the price of btc stalls at around    and then starts to decline the green path is operable but if the price continues to rally past the upper end  then the red course is most likely and btc should be on its way to bottom line since financial markets are all about the possibilities of probabilities bitcoin is at a crossroads it can decide to rally a little more before declining to the  region but possibly as low as the  level or it chooses to rally rather directly to new aths we will know over the next few days which it is either option will be a great buying opportunity so now may be a good time to be patient and let the market tell us where and when to place a lowrisk highreward trade
