macro investor and financial commentator jim rogers says governments may take steps to ban bitcoin if the cryptocurrency begins seriously threatening the future of fiat currenciesin a new video rogers argues that if bitcoin’s use case as a currency solidifies then there is a real danger of it usurping fiat currencies rather than cede power governments will seek to “outlaw” the flagship asset predicts rogersadvertisement“if bitcoin ever becomes a viable currency not a trading vehicle but a viable currency they can outlaw it“if it’s just a trading vehicle i don’t see any reason that they would outlaw it unless it’s money laundering or something like that no if people aren’t trying to use it to compete with government money why not”the macro investor adds that the threat governments pose to bitcoin will only grow once governments develop digital versions of their own fiat currencies“governments don’t want to lose control they like their monopoly and once they all have their own government money do you think they’re going to say ‘okay here are us dollars and they’re on the computer but if you want to use something else you can’that’s actually not my experience with governments anytime in history… well most times in history and i can’t imagine the us government’s going to let people do that”but for now rogers points out that he views bitcoin primarily as just a tradable asset with few other use cases unlike metals such as silver“as a store of value i don’t – well yeah considerably but i don’t know what the value is listen if we have a store of value of silver i know that silver can be used in solar panels and electric cars etc etc i don’t know what bitcoin can be used as except for trading them”ldont miss a beat – subscribe to get crypto email alerts delivered directly to your inboxfollow us on twitter facebook and telegramadvertisementcheck latest news headlinesadvertisementdisclaimer opinions expressed at the daily hodl are not investment advice investors should do their due diligence before making any highrisk investments in bitcoin cryptocurrency or digital assets please be advised that your transfers and trades are at your own risk and any loses you may incur are your responsibility the daily hodl does not recommend the buying or selling of any cryptocurrencies or digital assets nor is the daily hodl an investment advisor please note that the daily hodl participates in affiliate marketingfeatured image shutterstockgrandeduc
