finance insider we aim to help smart people make the wisest decisions with their money we also know that the word best is often subjective so we make sure to highlight both the benefits and drawbacks of crypto exchangeswe spent hours comparing and contrasting the features and product offerings of various crypto exchanges so you dont have tohow did we choose the best cryptocurrency exchangeswe researched several exchanges to find the best options for cryptocurrency availability low fees assetaccount security user interfaces and mobile accesswe also explored whether exchanges offered services both for individuals and institutions and we paid close attention to other account options like staking rewards margin trading and stablecoin supportwhat is a cryptocurrency exchangea cryptocurrency exchange is like an online brokerage for cryptocurrencies tokens virtual assets created through existing blockchains and other digital assets many of these exchanges offer investment options for active traders looking to buy sell or hold digital assets like bitcoin ethereum and litecoinmost exchanges also offer custody and storage options for users looking to safely protect their crypto assets against theft and hacks but then again most exchanges arent solely personal wallet services if you want to set up an external wallet with a bitcoin wallet provider or another storage wallet service you can do so while maintaining your crypto exchange accountyou can simply transfer assets between your exchange account and crypto wallet when necessaryare cryptocurrency exchanges worth itthis depends on your investment goals and needs you can invest in cryptocurrencies in more than one place for instance both paypal and sofi arent strictly cryptofocused companies but both offer digital assetsand if youre interested in lowcost options note that you can also trade cryptocurrencies with feefree brokerages like webull and robinhood the catch with taking this route is that you wont have as many cryptospecific features as you would with a kraken or geminiyou would essentially sacrifice a wider range of investments and account features for lower fees and limited cryptocurrency options if youre looking for a wider range of cryptospecific trading tools and account features a cryptocurrency exchange may be the best optionrickie houston is a wealthbuilding
