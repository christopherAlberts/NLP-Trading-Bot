peertopeer internet threefold goes multichain to accelerate token accessibilitypress releasepress release peertopeer internet threefold integrates with several popular blockchain ecosystems in an effort to increase adoption for the world’s largest such network april  dubai united arab emirates – threefold plans to integrate its peertopeer internet platform with three of the leading blockchain ecosystems in the decentralized finance defi space binance smart chain bsc ethereum and huobi’s eco chainthreefold is set to integrate bsc in the next couple of weeks with ethereum and huobi’s eco chain following shortly later on in  these integrations will provide the threefold ecosystem access to a wide array of defi applications in turn this will allow threefold to be more accessible to the defi world and provide threefold farmers and users with more platforms to exchange tftthreefold’s bold move comes while the wider cryptocurrency market is booming the total value of all cryptocurrencyrelated or blockchainbased projects has surpassed  trillion in recent weeks as market leaders such as bitcoin and ethereum set new alltime highs accordingly interest in blockchain technology is soaring as the number of active projects in the space nears moreover in an environment in which internet use for all aspects of life is soaring owing to  restrictions threefold’s main value proposition – a truly peertopeer internet platform – is gaining traction threefold sees the sustainability of internet services in the longrun and its decentralization as inseparabledemocratizing the internetbut why is this needed the internet today is hosted by a small group of wellresourced companies that are responsible for the maintenance of data centres which provide the server and storage space for the vast quantity of content on the internet in addition these same companies are finding a way to monopolize the network connections that allow data to flow around the globeas a result decisions made by these companies have the power to entirely change the landscape of the internet unilaterally without contest given the fact that the internet is now integral to much of the world’s industry as well as many ways of life the disproportionate power that these companies wield make them the de facto governors of the future of humanity’s developmentjust as satoshi nakamoto envisioned the democratization of the financial system through decentralization threefold is on a similar quest to democratize the internet with a unique combination of autonomous and blockchain technology the benefits would be clear more internet users would benefit from a neutral peertopeer platform on which to store their data and run their applications privately and securely moreover decentralization removes the internet’s singular potential points of failure which could seriously disrupt the global internet and cloud industrya multichain futurethreefold’s upcoming integration with bsc ethereum and huobi’s eco chain is a critical part of continuing to grow and cultivate the world’s largest peertopeer internet platform ethereum is the number one platform for decentralized applications dapps in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space as of todayaccordingly threefold’s platform will be put on the radar of the vast number of ethereum users who could quite effortlessly become the muchneeded nodes in its vision of a decentralized internet furthermore there is a wealth of decentralized development expertise concentrated in the ethereumsphere as well as in both binance’s and huobi’s blockchain ecosystems in addition to improving compatibility with these platforms threefold will be able to tap into these development skills inviting experienced dapp developers to build their applications on top of the threefold gridcomparatively threefold’s ambitious integration plans put it far ahead of similar projects in the decentralized internet space who are traditionally ethereumbased however with the increasing cost of ethereumbased development and its slower than required scalability updates threefold’s peertopeer internet will remain affordable scaleable and simple for developersabout threefoldthreefold is developing a peertopeer internet platform that aims to liberalize what it labels as a centralized and unequally distributed internet its platform called the threefold grid comprises over  servers in  different countries around the world delivering approximately  pb in storage and over  cpu cores worldwide making it the largest storage and compute peertopeer internet network in the world see threefold grid’s statistics in more detail using their explorer hereeach server runs threefold’s stateless and lightweight opensource operating system zeroos and is set up and operated by independent individuals and organisations called farmers farmers earn rewards in tft – the platform’s native token – for their participation tft is the currency of the threefold grid with each token representing a unit of storage and compute on the platform grid users can use these tokens to reserve the storage and compute they need to store build and share on the platform’s internet networkthreefold’s ultimate vision is to be part of the movement to fully democratize the internet worldwideto learn more about how threefold plans to democratize the internet visit their website here for more information on tft and how it fits into threefold’s overall plans see this pagefollow threefold on twitter httpstwittercomthreefoldioread threefold’s
