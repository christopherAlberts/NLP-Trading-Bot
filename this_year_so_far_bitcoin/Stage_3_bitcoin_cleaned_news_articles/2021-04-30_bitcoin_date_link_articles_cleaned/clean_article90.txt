april    min readthis story originally appeared on marketbeatethereum  is a stone’s throw awaynow that ethereum crypto eth is trading at a new alltime high and above the  level the question is how high will it go the simple answer is much much higher but there are some concrete targets investors speculators and traders can target the very first and most obvious is based on bitcoin ethereum and bitcoin tend to track each other with bitcoin leading the way and bitcoin has far outpaced eth over the past year in fact based on bitcoin’s  increase since it cleared the  high we think ethereum should already be trading near  but that will come in time  the berlin hardfork came and went without pause the berlin hardfork went live on april  with hardly a ripple in the market the fork introduced  new eips ethereum improvement protocols that have been in the works for at least two years the protocols do a number of things to address gas prices the cost of using the ethereum network including limiting fees for some types of transactions and introducing new transaction types the updates are the precursor for another eip hard fork scheduled for later this year an update that will have a farreaching impact on eth availability and pricingthe london hardfork will introduce eip  to the network and seriously cut down on gas fees the eip not only takes control of setting fees but will burn or permanently “lose” a portion of each fee once it’s collected this will work to reduce fees and increase traffic arguably increasing net earnings for miners while also reducing the supply of ether we think it is a winwin but not everyone in the ethereum community agrees with us  ethereum gas prices are already fallingone of the biggest hurdles for the ethereum network and its users is gas prices the fees for transactions have been steadily rising on the force of rising demand and the fact miners are allowed to prioritize higherpaying users over others the gas price for a transaction hit a high last year and held those levels well into  but that situation is already changing the price of gas spiked shortly after the berlin hard fork but has since fallen to the lowest levels in nearly a year if this trend continues it should help attract more users to the network users that have been turning to other blockchains because of high prices ethereum gains market shareeven with the high cost of gas ethereum has been gaining market share the best way to view that is via the market dominance or market cap of the cryptocurrency market bitcoin has long been the leader and that is not likely to change soon but it has been losing share over the past year bitcoin is losing share not only to ethereum but to the rise of defi tokens but let’s focus on ethereum ethereum hit a low point in regards to market share early in  and has seen a steady rise since this rise is in correlation with several key events including multiple hardforks and eips introductions and doubled eth’s market share from about  to nearly  today we expect this trend to continue the charts ethereum is in the lead nownot only is the chart of ethereum very bullish but it shows ethereum is now leading the market the price of bitcoin may be trading at higher level relative to past highs but its price is in consolidation it is trading below the  moving average and the indicators are still iffy ethereum on the other hand is trading at a new high is trading well above the  moving average and has bullish indicators if we were going to bet on one or the other making a strong move higher it would be on ethereumour first target for major resistance is near  we get that by projecting the magnitude of the latest rally from the current point of consolidation once that target is reached the  to  range  upside from the  alltime high comes into view and may be reached before the london hardfork goes live in julyfeatured article futures contract
