btcusd has run into headwinds the past couple of weeks after setting a record value of  on the  of april in the past week btcusd stumbled to lows of approximately  in fast market conditions since testing the recent lower values which were last experienced in the first week of march btcusd has again climbed higher bitcoin is trading within the lower part of its strong bullish trend which has been accomplished the past six monthsso should btcusd traders be disappointed by the current price action and lack of alltime highs during the past two weeks the simple answer is no btcusd cannot achieve record highs all the time and speculators within the cryptocurrency must accept the notion that reversals lower remain part of its dynamic trading environment btcusd has plenty of eyes on it and the scrutiny is quite possibly a good element for the cryptocurrencytechnically btcusd finds itself within an important juncture the current price of btcusd is within the center of its one month value range speculators may want to see prices sustain over key resistance levels which are within sight as the month of may gets ready to start remaining a speculative buyer of btcusd is the best choice for traders yes btcusd has certainly shown a capacity for being able to reverse lower but until the cryptocurrency breaks below its bullish range the trend continues to suggest upwards momentum can be foundconservative traders may want to wait for pullbacks within btcusd but its current price levels actually are intriguing as a place to activate buying positions traders need to use stop losses but these values can clearly be selected from a host of recent levels below which have technically been displayed the past week and a half of trading leverage is a big factor when trading btcusd and speculators need to choose the amount of money they are wagering carefullyinstead of being disappointed with the results of btcusd the past week and half of trading speculators may want to look at the current price ratio as an opportunity btcusd has not been able to attain a new record high every week and this result may actually help speculators find the volatility they crave in the coming weeksbtcusd outlook for mayspeculative price range for btcusd for may is  to btcusd which is traversing an important juncture presently has support near the  level if btcusd penetrates this mark the cryptocurrency could put in a test of lows demonstrated on the  and  of april when it dipped to the  ratio if further weakness were to develop speculators could then believe the  to  junctures could come into play and be tested as supporthaving achieved a high of nearly  in the middle of april was an accomplishment but the reversal lower since then has proven tough however if the  price can be touched and sustain values above traders technically could start to target the  resistance level if this higher value which was last traded on the  april can be hit it could set the table for buyers who believe bullish momentum can be reignited in full and that a test of the  value is attainablethe  price has proven to be strong resistance in the past couple of weeks and if the mark can be punctured higher then speculators will set their sights on the  and  settings if the value of btcusd can find sustained trading above the  juncture for a durable amount of time record highs will certainly be in the discussion again
