during a continued divergence in the crypto markets where ether posted new alltime highs while bitcoin wallowed at levels almost  below its peak the politics and buzz around both continue to spur thought and debatein the spirit of that this week’s newsletter dives into iran’s ostensibly probitcoin strategy and shows how it contravenes the level playing field values on which bitcoin is built it also looks at the explosion in nonfungible token nft sales and offers a lesson from crypto twitter on how to deal with rumorsafter you’ve read all that please find time to listen to this week’s excellent episode of our “money reimagined” podcastin the latest stop on our world tour of crypto hot spots sheila warren and i talk to two nigerian entrepreneurs yele bademosi the ceo of payments app bundle africa and adia sowho a venture builder and operator among this entertaining pair’s many cool insights was the idea the nigerian central bank’s february order that banks shut down crypto companies’ access backfired it spurred even more innovation inspiring local developers to dream up new decentralized solutions for getting around the banking sector’s gatekeepersiran is the cuba of the crypto agebe careful what you wish fornews this week that iran will allow a small set of qualified entities to pay for imports with cryptocurrency mined by licensed operators might sound like an enlightened move to some bitcoin enthusiastsit fits a narrative that when governments start accepting bitcoin they jumpstart its role as a universal reserve asset meanwhile the free trademinded who chafe at all government intervention in markets may view iran’s use of bitcoin to get around us sanctions as a positive blow for global commerce generallyyou’re reading money reimagined a weekly look at the technological economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system subscribe to get the full newsletter herebut look closer and you’ll see in iran’s bitcoin strategy the hallmarks of an authoritarian system that flouts the freedoms crypto advocates like to embrace when viewed alongside a crackdown against unlicensed crypto mining the regime’s moves could widen the divide between governmentfavored elites and average iranians below we delve into the lessons on this taken from cuba’s destructive dualcurrency systemit’s not clear if federal officials in washington will care about that inequity but it will view iran’s bitcoin solution for sanction avoidance with alarm as it undermines the united states’ selfappointed role as cop to the global financial system concerns about that will be amplified if it’s apparent that china which is eager to knock the dollar off its international reserve currency perch is directly or indirectly supporting iran’s approach the pathways for beijing to do so are already laidthe question is how should the biden administration respond let’s hope it avoids the temptation to roll this into a simplistic “bitcoin bad” narrative and imposes tighter controls on the cryptocurrency’s users in the us and elsewhere a more constructive approach would encourage iran to abandon its strategy for a crypto policy that favors innovation green infrastructure and economic freedom for all its citizenssome miners more equal than othersthe intent of the government of president hassan rouhani is hardly a mysteryeven though iran is a major oil producer years of crippling us sanctions aimed at containing its nuclear weapons program have deprived its economy of dollars that makes it very difficult for iran to buy what it needs from the world and ensures that the local currency the rial is under perpetual downward pressure which in turn stokes inflationnow by creating a legal framework in which bitcoin can be mined locally taxed under a strict licensing system and used by regulated institutions to pay for imports the government has a workaround iran will still struggle to sell its energy resources for dollars but it can do the next best thing it can convert that same local resource into bitcoin a harder currency than dollarsat the same time the regime is showing its authoritarian instincts in january it said that iran had  officially registered mining farms consuming  megawatts of power and that the ministry of energy had shut down  illegal bitcoin mining operations with a capacity of  megawatts over the prior  months it offered rewards of up to  million rials  for information leading to the arrest of illegal minersin a subsequent story by coindesk’s anna baydakova one household miner “basir” not his real name said he spent a week in jail before he could scrounge up the large bail amount by selling his house his car and his mining equipmentthe premise for the crackdown is that illegal mining is disrupting iran’s overstretched electricity grid but bitcoin advocates say that is unfair as the country’s blackouts have continued even after the authorities have done their sweepregardless by making itself the gatekeeper for domestically mined bitcoin and discriminating over which entities can access it the government is laying the groundwork for societal divisions – especially if bitcoin grows in importance as many expect it willto understand why let’s go back to the early years of the postcold war era in cuba another country that has labored under the constraints of us sanctionscubas lessonin  fidel castro’s regime was broke its longtime benefactor the soviet union had collapsed and the island economy was reeling from four years of “special period” austeritycastro reluctantly adopted a radical solution he legalized the use of us dollars but only within designated closely regulated industries such as governmentsanctioned tourism resorts that could only accept foreigners as guests it later entrenched this system by requiring all incoming foreign currency including that carried by foreign tourists be exchanged into “convertible pesos” a new local currency pegged onetoone with the dollar the new notes would circulate in parallel with the traditional cuban peso known as “moneda nacional” national currency but could only be used in those same sanctioned settingsthe strategy gave the regime a lifeline with taxes from regulated foreign currency inflows it continued to defy the helmsburton actbut the system created two cubas one where a privileged elite got access to goods and services available only in de facto foreign currency everyone else earned nearworthless moneda nacional which could buy only items listed on the “libreta” or ration book an artifact of soviet communism that guaranteed necessities such as bread and milk but excluded anything deemed to be a “luxury” – in effect anything imported to give you an idea of how limiting the libreta was it did not include the “luxury” of tamponsrachel suncoindeskthese deep divisions also bred rampant corruption because goods designated for the moneda nacional economy were hoarded and sold illegally in the convertible peso economybakers would secretly deliver half their production to fancy foreign touristonly restaurants denying libreta holders their bread rations gas stations would siphon off gasoline intended for domestic customers and deliver it to companies operating in the convertible peso economy painters would thin out their paint so that they could sell half their supplies to hotelsthe human effect of this stood out to me when i visited cuba for book research in  one day i hired a rickshaw driver with my convertible pesos every time he saw a policeman up ahead he urged me to dismount and walk to meet him two blocks down the road because he couldn’t be seen to be servicing dollarwielding foreign touriststhe system created a new class of predominantly white elites whose expat families in miami and madrid would send them foreign currency while doing nothing for a disproportionately black community without such tiesby the standards of communist cuba’s professed egalitarian ideals it was an abomination yet it took the government  years – until january of this year – to unify the currencies such was the intoxicating appeal of this unjust system for the castro dictatorship – first under fidel then under his brother raula different pathsimilar inequity lies ahead for iran if it sticks with its crypto strategy and as many of us believe bitcoin becomes a soughtafter store of value in a postcovid era of high debt slow growth and fiat currency depreciation some iranians will become phenomenally rich others will be stuck with worthless rials attempts to cross the divide will encourage corruption and social tensionsstill for the iranian regime the strategy is a tempting way to fund itself also given iran’s relationship with china – with which it recently struck a  billion  investment deal that included access to iranian oil and a plan for a binational “bank” – it presents an opportunity to shift the geopolitical landscapechina has the largest bitcoin mining industry in the world and so it’s not hard to imagine chinese bitcoin miners building officially endorsed fossil fuelrun facilities inside iran once bilateral payment agreements are in place to use digital currencies that bypass the usled global financial system one can foresee a feedback loop in which china gets oil iran gets hard currency the dollar’s power is diminished and bitcoin’s carbon footprint growshow should the us respondmy fear is the rallying cry in congress will be that bitcoin is “enabling” reprehensible sanctionsbusting behavior prompting calls for tougher crypto regulations that will only drive more activity underground and encourage more dirty fuel installations in iran and elsewhere – in effect strengthening the regime’s handthe alternative is the us government takes a more constructive approach encouraging innovation and economic freedom it could offer to work with domestic bitcoin miners to commit to zero greenhouse emissions and in so doing develop such energy sources whether it’s the government’s nuclear plants or locally run solar and wind operationsas i wrote in a prior newsletter i see a pathway for government incentives to make bitcoin mining a catalyst for green energy development iran as an energy powerhouse is well placed to work with us scientists on such solutionsone can hope rightoff the charts the growing nft piewith “saturday night live” making skits about nfts multiple sports stars and celebrities minting them and digital art selling for nosebleed prices it seems like a good time to check in on how the nft market has responded to all this attentionthankfully the latest quarterly report from consensys on the state of the decentralized finance defi ecosystem on ethereum contains a nice set of pie charts to tell the storyfrom the the   defi report consensysas expected sales of crypto art grew rapidly during the quarter as a mania for nonfungible tokens took hold however the spoils of the growing pie were not distributed evenly nifty gateway the nft platform acquired by gemini two years ago has consistently gobbled up the biggest piece of itwhy in one word beeple the march  million sale of the digital artist’s “everydays – the first five thousand days” digital collage was not only a major driver of the platform’s volume it also reflected the established relationship beeple had already built with christie’s nifty gateway and other sellers of highvalue digital artsign up to receive money reimagined in your inbox every fridaythe conversation the rumor milneherein lies an oldschool journalist’s crotchety warnings about treating rumors responsiblycrypto twitter can take some lessons from a saga that began with a tweet early tuesday by alistair milne whose twitter profile  followers says he is the cio of the altana digital currency fundthat got many many people excited – for obvious reasons bitcoin’s price did not immediately jump after the tweet but for the  period until the rumor turned out to be false it brushed with its highest level for the week knowing the triggerhappiness of the crypto investor scene it seems likely that milne’s tweet which was very widely shared prompted many to buynow before we discuss what facebook actually announced here’s a basic rule to which i was rightly subjected in financial newsrooms throughout my career we could never report on potentially marketmoving rumors however interesting they might be for the simple reason that you could cause people to unfairly lose or gain money on unsubstantiated hearsayrumors are prevalent in all markets precisely because people have vested interests in the price impact they can have the last thing you want to do as a respected news outlet with a large megaphone is to amplify the rumormonger’s message a rumor is a prompt for a journalist to try to confirm the truth of it not to report on it prematurelyof course milne is not a journalist but in the age of social media and for the purposes of this discussion it’s a distinction without a difference he has  followers and a reputation as an early investor in the space we all have a responsibility to our audienceanyway…facebook’s earnings came and went on wednesday evening with nary a mention of “bitcoin” “cryptocurrency” “blockchain” “dogecoin” or even “libra” or for that matter “diem”some delighted in the noneventness of it allbut others were incensed this twitter user summed up crypto twitter’s reaction quite nicely sound onas milne came under attack he stood his ground he didn’t delete the tweet and found some lighthearted ways to laugh it off asking whether he should delete his account and then declaring he would never tweet again until facebook does buy bitcoinbut his mentions kept filling up it probably didn’t help he had tweetboasted  hours before the facebook earnings release of taking profits nor that he later defensively blamed the rumor on someone elsehere two oldschool newsroom rules are useful  the problem is not that you start a rumor per se it’s that you amplify it and in so doing legitimize it and  just putting the label “rumor” on an unsubstantiated claim does not get you off the hook you’re still amplifying itthat last tweet  hours after the facebook earnings report suggests our culprit still has some learning to dostill it’s heartening to know that an angry twitter mob can have a sobering impact based on this last tweet from alistair milne on the topic thursday night he might think twice next timerelevant reads when etfbitcoin investors are hoping the us securities and exchange commission finally approves an exchangetraded fund for bitcoin giving the price a boost with at least three proposals before an sec that’s now led by cryptosavvy chairman gary gensler and given the success of three canadian etfs expectations are stronger than ever for a positive ruling
