fun fact robert downey jr based his tony stark iron man character from the marvel comics movies on elon muskthis is an eccentric billionaire that has decided to spend his fortune on a bona fide spaceship company spacex musk has repeatedly said he wants to personally colonize mars he even wants to be buried there would it really surprise you at this point to see musk flying around in an armored robosuit fighting the forces of evilif i had musk’s billions i’d likely blow them on a spaceship company too i can’t help it i’m a nerd and i love star trekalas buying a spaceship company is not in the cards at the moment but musk has been in the news more recently for far more terrestrial reasonsmusk’s bitcoin movewith his blessing musk’s electric vehicle company tesla inc nasdaq tsla sold off  of its massive bitcoin stashthe eccentric ceo hasn’t lost his enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency his personal bitcoin stash is unchanged the sale was to “prove the liquidity of bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on a balance sheet”i get it musk took some blowback from investors for betting tesla’s cash hoard on bitcoin the jury is still out as to whether that was a prudent move tesla booked a  million profit selling  of its holdings but bitcoin can be wildly volatile and that  billion investment could have easily been cut in halfi’m a bitcoin fan i believe every investor should own at least a little but i don’t like the idea of a car company effectively transforming itself into a crypto hedge fund without the bitcoin profits and tax credits tesla actually lost money last quarterbut let’s look at musk’s bigger point of finding alternatives to cash on the balance sheetalternatives to cashi hate to speak in wall street maxims but cash is trash right now inflation — by the federal reserve’s own estimation — is likely to run hot for a while even while interest rates are effectively zero you can’t put  of your savings in the stock market so what should you do with the cashhere’s my first rule of thumb make sure you have enough cash or expected investment income in dollars to meet your basic living expenses yes cash loses value each month due to inflation but your mortgage payment car payment and many other regular expenses are fixed you’re paying a loan that is losing value to inflation with dollars that are losing value to inflation you’re breaking even it’s all goodonce you have enough cash on hand to meet your fixed expenses for at least a few months be sure that you have dollar income streams via bonds dividend stocks etc to cover them indefinitelyafter these obligations are covered you don’t need to keep another nickel in cash bitcoin and other cryptos are viable for at least a portion of your savings and adam and i are both bullish on gold and precious metals in general we have several open recommendations in that sector in our newsletter green zone fortunesyou can also get a little more exotic and buy real estate or other hard assets but start small real estate can be an excellent longterm wealth builder you are almost guaranteed to make a few mistakes at the beginning so it’s a good idea to make those mistakes with a modest starting baseif you’re certifiably insane like musk you could also use your savings to build marsbound rocket ships but let’s maybe keep the spaceship allocation to your portfolio suitably smallto safe profitscharles sizemoreeditor green zone fortunescharles sizemore is the editor of green zone fortunes and specializes in income and retirement topics charles is a regular on the bull  the bear podcast he is also a frequent guest on cnbc bloomberg and fox business
