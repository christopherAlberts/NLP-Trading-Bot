by keegan franciswhat is bitcoinbitcoin is baffling to some and scary to others but it shouldn’t be eitherone reason may be the huge price swings over its  history another being the language used to describe itso let’s break it down broadly speaking bitcoin is three things it’s money a network and a blockchainbitcoin is moneyessentially bitcoin is money that can be sent and received directly between people on the internet in this sense bitcoin works a lot like cash as transactions take place solely between two people without the need for intermediariesunlike paper cash though governments can’t print it at willthere is a finite number of bitcoin and that number is  millioneach bitcoin can be subdivided into  million pieces called satoshis after the thoughttobe founder of bitcoin satoshi nakamoto just like dollars are made up of cents bitcoins are made up of satoshisbitcoin is also a networkbitcoin is supported by a vast network of computers each computer in the bitcoin network records and validates every transaction and every computer is responsible for checking the work of every other computer this ensures that no fraudulent transactions take place since there is no central authority governing bitcoin this system of checking and double checking is required in order for the system to function correctlybitcoin is a blockchainthe bitcoin blockchain is the record of each and every transaction that has taken place on the network like a digital ledger book made up of page after page or block after block of dataevery computer keeps the exact same copy of the ledger book and updates it as pages are added the book is the blockchain the pages the blockseach page is filled with transactions imagine the computers in the network as hundreds of thousands of accountants copying and checking each others work then sealing it the result is a system that makes it very difficult to cheat and pretty much impossible to fool everyone elsehow is bitcoin createdaround the world a new page of transactions is created about every  minutes through a process called mining it involves building these pages or blocks and securing them with an encrypted keywith each new block added to the blockchain a new amount of bitcoin is released into circulation when the network began in  this number was  bitcoin every  minutes every four years the number of bitcoin released with each block decreased by half as it stands in  there are  new bitcoin created every  minuteswhy you might want bitcointhere are several reasons first it’s a way to store of value it is for this reason that the city of miami is converting a portion of its cash reserves into bitcoin tesla the electric car company has also converted seven per cent of their cash reserves into bitcoin the reasons cited for doing this is to preserve the buying power of their cash reservesas central banks all over the world print trillions of dollars many are left to wonder what effect this will have on their cash savings bitcoin has a ceiling of  million coins the policy is written in code and enforced through the mining processthe second reason to hold some assets in bitcoin is that it is an internet based currency as it stands if you are transferring money across borders using our current banking infrastructure you will incur time delays and hefty fees with bitcoin you can transfer any amount of money anywhere in the world that has internet in  minutes or lessa downside is that the same system that allows an immigrating family to easily transfer money can also help tax dodgers or criminals to hide itbitcoin is here to stayexchanges like quadrigacx have gone bust costing investors millions yet big players like tesla are buying into bitcoin what’s the lesson here crypto currencies are useful theyre risky too but there’s also risk in standing on the sidelines just like the internet in  bitcoin is in its infancy one thing for certain is it’s likely here to staykeegan francis is cofounder of atlantic blockchain
