interoperability may be the single biggest threat to ethereum’s dominancewhile it may still be the primary network hub for defi activities smart contracts and nfts bridges built using competing networks like tezos could pose a serious challenge to ethereum’s market share in these areasnew solutions to old problems could undermine network’s potencyin the time since the network’s unveiling ethereumkillers have abounded with claims that they would displace the network with faster transactions more scalability lower fees and effectively do just about everything betterdespite all the hype surrounding these answers to ethereum’s flaws no network has been able to displace the network’s appeal in totality yet ethereum’s deficiencies are currently coming under attack from all sides and more so than ever beforethe recently unveiled wrap protocol from bender labs is one of several arrows that could seriously maim ethereum’s status this highly interoperable decentralized protocol will enable the transformation and transfer of ethereum tokens including  and  standards to the tezos blockchainethereum tokens are effectively locked on the blockchain through this protocol before a “wrapped” version is created on the corresponding network in this case tezos the wrapped version’s underlying value is tied to the actual token being copied using the wrap native token to orchestrate the transformation all wrapped ethereum tokens are then compatible with tezos’  standard allowing them to be freely used within the networka serious challenge to the status quowhile defeating ethereum isn’t bender labs stated objective the idea of building a more open interoperable decentralized financial system does challenge the network’s dominance especially in defi and smart contractsthis new protocol’s “bridge” will empower token holders to move freely between the two ecosystems with minimal switching costs providing a greater abundance of choice while granting users the opportunity to vote with their feetgiven that tezos now boasts a much more affordable ecosystem for developers and users relative to ethereum thanks to its proofofstake consensus this newfound ability to seamlessly migrate between chains represents a severe threat moreover the selfupgradeable nature of tezos means that future adjustments to the network to are much easier to implement relative to ethereum’s drawnout upgrade processan unpredictable adoption pathsurging fees on ethereum that are difficult to predict reliably already present the needed catalyst for an exodus of developers and users the attraction of tezos’ lower transaction costs with no demonstrable changes in user experience is difficult to denyhowever though it may appear like an ethereumkiller in certain respects wrap protocol might have the opposite effect over the long term by giving users a nearfrictionless method to move between ecosystems ethereum might actually benefit from expanded usehow quite simply if defi becomes more competitive and smart contract use expands the two networks will likely compete for demand as each continually upgrades and innovates to attract participation if resulting innovation sends costs tumbling it will invite even greater participation from users and developers alike effectively expanding the universe of crypto users instead of splitting it down the middlethough talks of ethereum’s imminent demise will proliferate wrap protocol is still a serious shot across the bow that might have shortterm consequences for the network even with ethereum’s forwardlooking potentialdo you think the harsh competition against ethereum hurts the network or makes it stronger let us know in the comments section belowimage credits shutterstock pixabay wiki commonsdisclaimer this article is for informational purposes only it is not a direct offer or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell or a recommendation or endorsement of any products services or companies bitcoincom does not provide investment tax legal or accounting advice neither the company nor the author is responsible directly or indirectly for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any content goods or services mentioned in this article
