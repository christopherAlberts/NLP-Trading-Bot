guidelines as well as antimoney laundering aml regulations they are now conducting a pilot that allows top local commercial banks to work with notable international crypto exchanges to test certain servicesbut none of the recent regulatory measures appears to be overly restrictive banning crypto would be pointless said castro who is a member of the evaluating committee for the sandbox“the correct thing to do is gather data and implement regulations incrementally as required the position of the colombian government regarding crypto regulations is that they shouldn’t be made without data and without sufficient information” castro saidthe banking pilotin january colombia’s financial watchdog the sfc announced that nine crypto firms out of  applicants were chosen to test banking services for crypto platforms in a yearlong project that started in march according to the announcement the goal of the pilot is to allow colombia’s fintech firms and the national government to safely test crypto use cases under the regulatory sandboxthe country’s biggest banks have worked with international crypto exchanges operating in colombia and budacom was one of the selected firms bancolombia partnered with gemini while davivienda bank partnered with binance latin american exchanges buda and bitso are working with banco de bogotáaccording to beltrán the banks will be working with crypto platforms to test onoff ramps for deposits and withdrawals“but the banks don’t touch any cryptocurrencies they don’t have a direct relationship with cryptocurrencies” beltrán saidthe pilot project has no impact on the current regulatory framework applicable to crypto assets the sfc said in the announcement castro explained that as part of the sandbox the chosen crypto firms are allowed to test their own projects under their own rules and so the government can gather data for implementing regulations“but those crypto firms have to work together with the government and regulated banking institutions” castro said referring to the sandboxbudacom’s own pilot test will allow its users who already have bank accounts with banco de bogotá to make deposits on the platform through their bank accounts bank customers who are interested in the pilot project or cryptocurrencies can register on budacom to start using cryptocurrenciesbeltrán added that budacom is validating some details with the bank and he hopes to begin operations in may or juneaml guidelinesin december colombia’s superintendency of corporations published a circular that included aml guidelines for financial institutions in accordance with the rules specified by the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog the fatfcastro said that because banks are regulated the partnerships between crypto firms and those involved in the sandbox presents a much easier and legal way to implement aml requirements“the exchange must implement risk management of money laundering and terrorist financing operational risk and cybersecurity and consumer protection measures during the test” castro said “the sandbox is allowing colombians to carry out operations with crypto firms within high security standards and adequate risk management in a similar way to what is currently done with ecommerce”beltrán said the local crypto industry had been ready for aml regulations for five years“before this we had a voluntary system but now we are obligated to integrate it by the rules of colombia” beltrán saidgovernment can’t ignore cryptoit wasn’t always smooth sailing for budacom in  a lack of regulatory clarity about crypto in colombia led to a number of local banks shutting down accounts held by the exchange“the government tried for years to deny the existence of crypto but right now because cryptocurrency is a global phenomenon they can’t deny what’s happening and they are trying to to change their minds” beltrán said he added that when the budacom accounts were shut down the financial authorities did not speak to him about getting the accounts back onlineaccording to castro the goal of the sandbox is to pave the way for a legal framework that doesn’t stop innovation in the crypto or decentralized finance defi spacecastro also said the colombian government is not only carefully stepping into the crypto market but is looking at ways to use blockchain to fight corruption last year the government began working with the world economic forum wef on a blockchainbased solution to tracking government contracts in a transparent way
