the final year of the last millennium a total solar eclipse was eclipsed by cloud in the skies above the uk and the euro was born perhaps with less fanfare the individual savings account was launchedbut keen savers who piled into a stock and shares individual savings account in april   and those who let their personal equity plan pots roll over  might have rued the decision in the following yearsafter a decade of booming stock prices and the dawn of the new millennium the party would soon be over the ftse  index lost nearly half of its value in the three years from christmas saw it coming the total solar eclipse of  mostly obscured by cloud in the skies above britain was widely anticipated which is more than can be said of the  dotcom crashlaith khalaf financial analyst at investing platform aj bell says  was ‘not exactly an auspicious time’ to begin investing ‘the tech bubble was about to burst the split cap investment trust scandal was about to explode and stocks were about to fall into a threeyear bear market’ he saysindeed after a couple more big booms and busts the footsie is barely registering a gain over the last  years purely on capital appreciation the index is up a bit more than  per centeven with dividends reinvested a ftse  tracker would have earned you  per cent – or just shy of  per cent in real terms after accounting for inflation so much for time in the market it might be observedso as isas reach  years old where did investors make the biggest returns over that lifetime if not in londonlisted bluechips well for a start anyone shadowing the ftse  index would have done far better with a total return of  per cent over the periodhow equity indices have peformed since isas were launched in april there has been much hullabaloo about the strength of the us stock market says khalaf but actually uk small and midcaps have shown a clean pair of heels to the sp  since the ftse small cap index is up  per cent over the period but it is funds concentrating on smaller uk companies  alongside those in the asian equities sphere  that have really earned investors stellar returnsthis was achieved in part by massively outperforming indices suggesting that in some sectors at least active management might be worth paying forthe top performing funds and investment trusts since isas were launchedon the openended side of things  what savers commonly refer to as funds oeics or unit trusts  the top ten performers since april  are dominated by the uk and european smaller companies sectorshow openended funds have performed since isas were launched the average performance of all investment association sectors over this period this figure can be used as a proxy for average investor returnschina gets a lookin with two funds and the  are rounded off by the biotech vehicle from pictetthe standout winner is the marlborough special situations fund with an eyewatering  per cent total return which would have turned a £ lump sum invested at the start of the period into £ nowrun by giles hargreave and his team the fund has around  holdings among which are some midcaps while it is the topperforming vehicle of any sort over the  years it is a stark exception as no other fund would make it into the investment trust top investment trusts  or closedend funds  which are listed on the uk stock market and can borrow to invest earned much higher returns than their openended counterpartshow investment trusts have performed since isas were launched exposure to the far east and the healthcare and biotechnology sectors feature heavilythe current poster boy for investment trusts and ftse  consituent scottish mortgage scrapes into the top  after being an early backer of some of todays tech titans a thousand pounds invested there in the first isa would have earned you £ by nowbut trusts focused on asia healthcare and biotech and again smaller firms outperformed even this darling of retail investors its stable partner at baillie gifford the pacific horizon trust would have turned your grand into £the smaller companies theme is continued in scottish oriental and hgcapital trust which is a private equity vehiclelessons for this years isa investorsthe superior performance of smaller companies funds is apparent across all developed markets so it might be a good idea for today’s investors to think small with their isa portfoliorecently investors have looked to cryptocurrencies and meme stocks to get rich quick but they might instead consider the stunning returns provided by some smaller companies funds given time to grow says laith khalafthe performance of the main developed markets fund sectors versus their smaller companies counterparts funds in the main sectors are typically heavily skewed towards large caps with some mid cap exposure too but in all four regions smaller companies have significantly outperformed the main blue chip sectorsthe data also suggests that active funds might be worth their fees  particularly in a sector like small companies where wellinformed managers can pick out winners and some firms might not even be listed on the stock marketas noted a ftse  index tracker would have returned  per cent over the  years in question  a return that was significantly bettered by most fund sectors and investment trustsother global indices like the us sp  might have done substantially better than our footsie  but that just goes to show that care is still need when choosing trackers or passive fundskhalaf also sounds a note of caution for todays isa savers observing that there are clear resonances with  with signs of bubbly behaviour in the price of bitcoin and meme stocks and a tech sector that has been on a tremendous runthe big tech titans of the us market are much more robust than many of the flimsy startups of the late  but their high valuations still give some cause for caution he addshowever investors can take heart from the long term returns that have been harvested since  across all equity markets despite turmoil in the first few years of the millennium
