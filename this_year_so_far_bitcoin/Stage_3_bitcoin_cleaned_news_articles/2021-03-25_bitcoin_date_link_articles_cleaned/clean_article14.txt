by using energy to validate transactions in a way that is independent of any existing grid or source bitcoin mining will save the climateit’s in vogue to think that bitcoin is accelerating the climate crisisthe common argument is that bitcoin uses lots of energy which must mean more carbon emissions so as a result it’s ruining the climate of course critics also seem enraged at bitcoin itself believing it doesn’t do anything useful beyond facilitating a casino for reddit memelords and “libertarian nerds” to get rich in to these critics bitcoin is a totally useless degenerate system that will end up consuming all energy on the planet in  months if we don’t stop it right nowwhile this fatalist prediction might succeed in earning clout on twitter it is fortunately far from the truth incredibly far in fact if i may do some clout chasing of my own the prediction that bitcoin will destroy the climate is the literal opposite of what bitcoin is likely to dobitcoin will save our earthby the end of this read you will understand how bitcoin uses energy to validate transactions and how this is driving more efficient energy usage and lower emissions for the entire global energy grid not just the bitcoin systemwhy does bitcoin need energythis is the first part that confuses many people because bitcoin is a novel type of monetary technology which has no analogue importantly bitcoin is not visa or paypal — and it uses energy for different purposesbitcoin requires energy in order to secure the history of transactions a recipient of bitcoin can reasonably trust that the bitcoin they’ve received is really theirs because miners expended energy and therefore incurred an unavoidable realworld cost in order to fit that transaction into a block of transactions and hitch it onto the “blockchain” we call this strong assurance that a transaction is completed “finality”if you take out that energy expenditure there is no cost associated with changing a transaction the original sender could decide later to change their transaction so it points to another one of their wallets instead of your wallet poof now you never got paid or maybe the money is in two places at once that just won’t fly in a monetary or payments system this little copypaste problem is known in nerd circles as the “doublespend problem” bitcoin is the only system which solves this problem at scale without a trusted third party and energy usage is the key component of that solutionthe more energy that bitcoin consumes the more cost is incurred in securing the chain more security means an “attack” on the history of transactions is more expensive — so expensive that double spending is uneconomical or downright impossible the more cost incurred to secure the chain after your transaction the more “final” that transaction is more energy consumption  more securitymany critics argue that the bitcoin energy consumption per transaction compared to a visa payment proves the horrible inefficiency of the bitcoin network this plays on our assumption that a “transaction” is always something small — like buying a cup of coffee however a “transaction” can also be a group of these smaller transactions — a “batch” — so that one “transaction” on a payment system like bitcoin or fedwire can actually represent millions of coffee purchasescritics of bitcoin’s energy use also miss the key point of why bitcoin uses energy bitcoin is not just a payments system — it is also an entirely new form of scarce divisible portable commodity — aka money bitcoin consumes energy primarily to ensure the scarcity of bitcoins and finality of transactions without a trusted third partyother monetary systems like the us dollar achieve scarcity and finality — key properties of money — through trust you and i need to trust politicians and bankers to be good stewards of the monetary system we entrust with them the power to literally create currency out of thin air and they have the power to reverse or block transactions most of these gatekeepers are not elected officials either — they are the chairmen and employees of central banks and commercial banks and they create new money and allocate it as they see fit fiendishly new money is created every time a government sells bonds to its central bank or banks extend loans — which is often especially in about  times more dollars were printed in  than in the entire history of the us dollar up to that one year source federal reserve economic databasetrusting these gatekeeper elites doesn’t seem to be working out in this day and age in fact it hasn’t worked out for very long in any largescale system that put too much faith in central plannersbitcoin replaces people carrying biases blind spots and sometimes malice with a set of coded rules and energy usage leading to more fairness in the monetary system instead of google’s “don’t be evil” credo we can now achieve “can’t be evil” when it comes to governing the monetary system the laws of physics apply the same to every human being regardless of race creed wealth or social standing — and those rules govern bitcoinyou might still think bitcoin doesn’t matter — that it’s just a stupid casino for reddit dwellers and that’s fine arguing that isn’t the purpose of this piece — i have plenty of other material explaining why bitcoin matters but as you’ll see after the next section even a stupid casino can save the planetdoes more bitcoin energy consumption help or hurt the climatenow that we understand why bitcoin needs energy in the first place we need to address the question of whether bitcoin’s energy consumption helps or hurts the climate many bitcoin detractors love to play on your assumptions that more energy use is categorically bad for the environment but that misses many nuances of how energy is produced and consumedto approach the question of bitcoin’s climate impact we first need to understand bitcoin mining as a business and the need that miners have for energy i spent about six months in  building a business plan running financial models visiting potential mining sites and fundraising for a  megawatt mining facility in the united states so i have some limited experience on this subjectif you remember the concept of “perfect competition” from your econ  class bitcoin is about the most “perfectly competitive” market that the world has ever seen it is incredibly hard to get an edge or advantage over any other miner because the components to mining are very simple — powerful computers and cheap energy the bitcoin protocol doesn’t care about mining company brands or logos and it doesn’t offer anything differentiated that one miner can provide but others cannotsource evan baylesscompetition between miners consistently shaves away at the profits any miner can make as long as a miner can find energy cheap enough to mint bitcoin at belowmarket price they have an incentive to start up a mining farm when the bitcoin price increases rapidly this means even more energy sources become profitable to hook up miners to — until new mining operations “soak up” this excess profit this means miners are always forced to either pray for higher bitcoin prices upgrade the efficiency of their mining equipment or find cheaper energy sourcespraying for higher pricesbitcoin doesn’t listen to prayers as anyone who has traded it knows — so praying for a price rise is not a very reliable solution besides rising bitcoin prices bring an incentive for new and existing miners to expand their operations and increase the “hashes” guesses at the bitcoin mining game they’re producing that in turn causes difficulty to rise yet againupgrade mining hardware efficiencymore efficient mining hardware only comes out once every few years and improvements are slowing due to the laws of physics making it harder to fit more processing power on a chip semiconductor companies have noted for years that moore’s law is slowing down meaning it is taking longer to double the number of transistors on a chip today it is incredibly expensive to develop and produce more efficient mining chips requiring years of research and development and millions of dollars to test and “tape out” new chips with major semiconductor manufacturers like tsmc in taiwancooling equipment ie fans also draws a lot of power so more efficient cooling solutions can improve overall mining efficiency — but there’s a ceiling to that improvement as well we’ll expand on the role of cooling laterimmersing mining computers in mineral oil can lead to efficiency gains given the improved ability of oil to carry heat away versus air source coindeskboth more efficient hardware and more efficient cooling solutions lead to turning the same amount of electricity into more hashes contrary to the common criticism that only the “most powerhungry computers make a profit” it is the least power hungry computers that make the most profitfind cheaper powerpower is essentially the only variable cost for a miner at scale seeking cheaper power is about the only thing that can save a miner when the bitcoin protocol begins to squeeze a miner’s profit the miner may move their machines to a new location with cheaper power or be forced to shut down and sell their machines to someone else who has access to cheaper power either way profitability is regained and the average cost of power used to secure the network is pushed lower the most important ongoing factor for a mining operation is simply power costthis has very important implications for climate change and emissions because it means bitcoin mining is forced to find cheaper and cheaper power sources over time critiques of bitcoin’s energy use and climate impact today focus on estimating bitcoin’s existing uses of power — especially during bull markets when miner’s have large profit margins — while ignoring the longterm trend implied by the functioning of the protocol and the evolution of energy technologiesthankfully cheap energy fit for bitcoin mining is increasingly not found in fossil fuels but in renewables wasted and “stranded” sources of energy as we’ll dive into nextbitcoin improves energy efficiency and promotes renewablesenergy consumption by humanity correlates well with gdp and quality of life while correlation is not causation it’s easy to reason that more energy production allows us to give to machines more of the backbreaking labor that supplies food shelter clothing and other creature comforts to us that at least affords us the opportunity to improve our quality of life if only in material wayshowever it’s no secret that energy production can have unwanted consequences in the form of pollution or local and global ecosystem changes knowing what we know about bitcoin’s mining dynamics what can we learn about the types of energy that bitcoin is likely to seek out and its resulting impact on the environmentcheaper renewablesnow that we understand why the bitcoin network will always seek cheaper energy over time we need to look at the cost of energy by source the investment bank lazard produces an analysis of energy costs by source annually which is widely considered an industry benchmark data from its  report belowutilityscale solar geothermal and wind power are on par with or cheaper than conventional fuels like nuclear and coal unsubsidized sourcethankfully renewables are on par with or cheaper than conventional power sources at industrial scales this holds true in most places around the globe and the trend is getting stronger this means bitcoin miners will necessarily seek out renewable power as time goes on especially excess capacity or overproduction that leads to even lower prices mining also provides developers of renewable power sources with another potential income stream helping push progress on the learning curve of various renewables and accelerating further cost reductionswasted energybesides seeking cheap renewable energy the portability of bitcoin mining hardware versus other power consumers like your home or the city you live in means it can take advantage of power that would otherwise be wastedone example of currently wasted energy comes in the form of flared natural gas unfortunately we still need to power our cars and planes with oil until elon musk can create a hivemind of selfdriving tesla pods given that explorers looking for oil often hit pockets of natural gas while drilling in remote locations oil is expensive enough that it’s profitable to put it on trucks and drive it from these remote locations to where that oil is refined and pumped into your car but transporting natural gas is often not economically viable from these locations companies can either release the gas into the atmosphere or literally burn it off “flare” it — which is what governments usually mandate them to do in order to limit environmental impactflared gas over a peaceful sunset sourcethis natural gas is both stranded — too far from energy consumers to be useful — and wasted — because it cannot be stored once the drill hits it this gas is a liability to the driller who hits it because it doesn’t produce any income and it actually costs them money to flare it safelybitcoin mining turns flared gas into an opportunity however instead of simply burning off the gas drillers can use a gas generator to power a portable box of bitcoin miners turning previouslywasted energy at a remote oil well into bitcoin these drillers don’t even need to care about bitcoin to find this useful — they can just sell their bitcoin immediately to make an income stream off of gas that they previously had to burn off companies like upstream data crusoe energy and giga energy are pioneering this fieldthis energy usage improves the security of the bitcoin network without causing any additional harm to the environment in fact part of the revenues from this type of mining could be applied to filtering flared gas exhaust leading to less environmental impactstranded energybitcoin mines are the least locationdependent consumers of energy on the planet as a result they can easily use energy sources that are “stranded” far from current population centers — like ocean currents or desert sun these sources either aren’t economically viable to develop at all or have the potential to produce more power than the existing nearby consumers can possibly use bitcoin mining presents an income stream that helps bootstrap funding to develop these stranded energy sources once energy production is up and running these cheap sources of power can be a draw for other power consumers — like data centers factories even people — to locate near themabundant energy sources far from population centers like offshore wind are attractive options for bitcoin mining source the timesfor many miners a large percentage of their power cost goes toward simply cooling their machines however this cooling cost can be significantly reduced just by putting miners in very cold climates which are often far from population centers and likely to have excess renewable power that’s “stranded” too far from enough consumption to match production bitcoin technology and mining company bitfury utilizes this confluence of factors well “‘many data centers around the world have  to  percent of electricity costs going to cooling’ explains valery vavilov the ceo of bitfury ‘this is not an issue in our iceland data center’” “why the biggest bitcoin mines are in china” spectrum iceland’s energy production mix almost  percent renewable — with an estimated  percent coming from hydropower and  percent from geothermal iceland is known for having more energy resources than it can consume locally leading to big boons in energyintensive industries like aluminum smeltinga major mining facility in norilsk russia is another example this city of  puts vast energy resources to work producing nickel but the frigid temperatures and excess energy in this region make it a perfect candidate for bitcluster’s newest mining farmthe nature of the bitcoin protocol and mining dynamics force miners to seek progressively cheaper energy sources and that means utilizing renewable wasted and stranded energy bitcoin is not taking gas from your car or electricity from your house it is making power production more efficient utilizing otherwise “stranded” energy sources and helping to fund the development of renewable energy technologiesthese are the early daysall that said about the production and consumption of energy related to bitcoin we must note that bitcoin is still a very early and emergent technology this may be hard to tell when the headlines are full of mentions of new price levels and whirring mining machines but people companies and power producers are still catching on to bitcoin the evolution we are watching is not a five to  process it is a  to  one focusing too closely on what’s happening today or in the last few years is missing the forest for the treesbitcoin mining is not a consumer technology like the television or mobile phone — it is an industrial technology that requires heavy energy infrastructure more akin to airplanes automobiles and the telephone which required new physical infrastructure to be installed airports roads telephone lines sourceenergy production is a foundational complex and deeply ingrained technology — it will not be revolutionized overnight we must consider the long arc of history when we evaluate potential impacts of a new technology like bitcoin as it relates to energyin bitcoin’s case the novel technology provides energy producers a radically new way to monetize energy and as a result it will permeate every energy production site across the globe this will push down the profitable price of energy for all miners driving more energy efficiency as wasted stranded and renewable sources with nearzero or below zero energy cost are sought out to power mining facilitiesthe casino that saved the earthbitcoin may just be a casino for degenerate gamblers but this casino serves as the buyer of last resort for electricity produced everywhere in the world the positive impact of the presence of a buyer of last resort in the energy market is hard to overstateas bitcoin disseminates through the world bitcoin mining willincrease energy efficiency by utilizing wasted energy finance the exploration of “stranded” and often renewable power sources push the learning and adoption curves for renewable energythat sounds a whole hell of a lot more environmentally friendly than paper strawsso environmentalists if you truly believe in saving our earth take a deeper look at this technology and the role it plays in energy markets if you’d prefer to chase clout at the expense of making a real impact crying wolf is probably easiermany thanks to the bitcoin critics supporters and observers who have done so much researching analyzing
