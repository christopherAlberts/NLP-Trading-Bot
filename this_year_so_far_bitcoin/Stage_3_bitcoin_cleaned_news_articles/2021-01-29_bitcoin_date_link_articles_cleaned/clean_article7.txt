“are you running the numbers”this is what bitcoin core developer andrew chow is trying to find out in a new surveysponsored by a grant from mit’s digital currency initiative chow crafted the survey “to get answers from people who are not current users” about why they don’t run a bitcoin core full node the wallet software which simultaneously keeps a record of bitcoin’s transaction history and connects users to other peers in the networksubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policybitcoin full nodes are like servers so if you’re not running your own to broadcast transactions to the wider network then you’re relying on someone else’smoreover a full node offers users complete control over what encoded rules they want to follow as well as the ability to independently verify a variety of network data the popular bitcoin memes “one node one vote” and “run the numbers” demonstrate that these principles of selfverifiability and freedom of choice are core principles for bitcoin’s most fervent followersin short running a full node is the ultimate exercise in financial selfdetermination in the bitcoin realmso that’s why chow launched the survey which runs until march  to give developers an “idea of the biggest barriers facing people who might want to run a node but currently do not” the inspiration came from a conversation with fellow developers about the removal of a littleknown wallet feature for bitcoin core“several months ago a few other bitcoin core developers and i were discussing the removal of a feature called zapwallettxes the main question that we had was whether anyone actually used it this basically led to the general sentiment of wishing to know how users actually use bitcoin core” he told coindesk in a direct messagebitcoin core usage surveythe survey’s first questions establish the basics where are you from how’d you find the survey do you run a bitcoin core full nodeif the respondent replies that they do run a node the survey follows up by asking if they use the bitcoin core wallet and if they ever have in the past if you do run a node the survey will continue to grill you over the specifics of your use how often you update what other softwarehardware you use why you run a node etcif you don’t run a node the survey asks you what wallet you use if you own bitcoin and what barriers have kept you from running a node be they technical complexity or otherwisehow many bitcoin nodes are theremeasuring the total number of active nodes on the bitcoin network is tricky because some nodes may choose to be open to connect to any other node a “listening node” while others may choose to keep their connections closed and private a “nonlistening node”still one of the more accurate metrics comes from prolific bitcoin developer luke dash jr whose data estimates there are roughly  bitcoin core nodes currently active and just over  or so of bitcoin’s other few software versionsthis is long shy of the  bitcoin nodes that were running back at the peak of ’s market cycle according to the same data but still more than the  or so that were operating in the aftermath of march ’s historic selloffbetterthanexpected responseso far the survey has  recorded responses which is more than chow and his peers projected for the early stages of the survey which will run for roughly five more weekschow said he plans to publish the data he collects once it’s fully analyzed adding that “there are no plans to act on the results” bitcoin’s development is distributed after all so coordinating around specific changes for the diversity of users in the survey isn’t practical
