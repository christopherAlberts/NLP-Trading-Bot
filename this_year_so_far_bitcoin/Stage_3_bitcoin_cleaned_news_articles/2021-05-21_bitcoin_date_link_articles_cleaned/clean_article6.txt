a natural gas flare on an oil well pad burns as the sun sets outside watford city north dakota january   reutersandrew cullenon us oil patches stretching along the rockies and great plains trailers hitched to trucks back up toward well pads to capture natural gas and convert it on the spot into electricitythe trailers  carrying pipes generators and computers  are called “mining rigs” but their owners aren’t there to drill for oil they are using stray natural gas unwanted by oil companies to power their search for another treasure cryptocurrencies like bitcoincryptocurrencies are virtual coins exchanged without middlemen such as central banks to purchase goods and services extracting the currency from cyberspace however requires vast amounts of oftenexpensive electricity supercomputers must run constantly in a race against other “miners” to solve complex math problems in order to unlock digital vaults holding the currencyplaced in mobile trailers these supercomputers run as hot as  degrees fahrenheit  degrees celsius and in the cold of western north dakota people stay warm just by sitting near them cryptocurrency miners saythe miners are increasingly sending these rigs out to oil fields because it’s one of the cheapest ways to obtain the energy they need oil and natural gas come from the same wells but at these sites drillers are seeking crude oil and have no pipelines to get the gas to market that typically forces them to burn it off in a process called flaring  creating carbon dioxide emissions  or to vent it into the atmosphere directly as methanethe sweet spot for us is stranded low volumes of gas that dont justify a pipeline said steve degenfelder land manager at wyomingbased producer kirkwood oil and gas llc which has formed an alliance with bitcoin minersoil companies face pressure from investors and government officials to reduce emissions that lead to global warming sometimes they give the gas away for free to cryptocurrency miners other times they sell itoil and gas companies dont like to flare their gas  thats money thats burning away said degenfelder which works with miners connected to ez blockchain a chicagobased energy and technology company to cut flaring at some of its  oil wells across the rocky mountainshighly uncertainsome environmental advocates and investors say cryptocurrencies are not a longterm solution to unwanted natural gas emissions both because the currency’s future is highly uncertain and because bitcoin and other cryptocurrency companies produce their own emissionsthe global bitcoin industry’s overall  emissions have risen to  million tons equal to the exhaust from about  million cars that’s up from  million tons from two years ago according to a march report by bank of america analystsvalues of bitcoin the best known cryptocurrency plunged from record highs after billionaire elon musk tweeted that his electric car company tesla inc would no longer take the virtual coins as payment citing concerns over rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions” the currency plunged in value over two weeks before starting to recover thursdayandrew logan senior director of oil and gas at ceres the bostonbased cleanenergy investor group said there are better ways to use stranded gas including to power hospitals and schools however that would require building pipelines to carry the product out of the oil patch he saidi think we need much more durable and longterm solutions that really bring that gas to market and let it be used for whatever its highest purpose is he saidproponents say the new oilcryptocurrency alliances in north america move mining for virtual coins away from asia home to more than  of such operations which largely rely on coalpowered electricity coal combustion produces roughly twice as much  as natural gasit helps cut emissions at an oil producer level but also globally by reducing mining in parts of the world where coal is likely the power source said mark le dain vice president of strategy at oil and gas software company validere technologies inc which tracks energy molecules and their useenvironmental advocates and some investors note however that the harmful emissions don’t disappear  they are transferred from one industry to anotherits not like youre eliminating the emissions its that youre turning them into this other thing bitcoin” logan saidcatching imaginationsthe allure of bitcoin remains for miners despite the challenges of cryptocurrency markets even after the recent price crash a single bitcoin was worth more than  on thursday  almost  times its value five years ago according to refinitiv eikon datasome cryptocurrency mining companies say the mobility of their natural gasfueled operations is key giving them flexibility to draw natural gas from different sites as it becomes availablethe idea that you could plug in these computers and then take them somewhere else just really caught my imagination said haley thomson a former electricity trader and president of new cryptocurrency mining company imperium digitala variety of business models have been born in some cases cryptocurrency miners pay the oil firms for their natural gas wholly or in part using the coins they mine in the case of kirkwood ez blockchain uses stranded natural gas to make bitcoin giving it all to kirkwood ez blockchain makes money by supplying equipment and mining services for a feeindustry experts and academics who study energy uses say there are fewer than  largescale bitcoin mining companies in north america that run on stranded natural gas many cryptocurrency miners run smaller operations in the united states and canada  some fueled by a single wellbut some major oil companies have signed onin north dakota a top oilproducing state norways equinor asa eqnrol and canadas enerplus corp erfto are among those that have used such mining to reduce flaring company spokespeople confirmed to reutersdenverbased crusoe energy systems inc is one of the continent’s largest bitcoin mining companies using otherwise stranded gas it expects to double its current staff of  this year said cully cavness cofounder and a former oil and gas engineercrusoe has about  mobile containers in oil shale basins it plans on increasing that number to  after receiving  million in financing last month from investors including chicagobased firm valor equity partners lp and lowercarbon capitalcrusoe’s partners have included kraken oil  gas partners llc which produces about  bpd of oil making the company the largest oil producer in montanawere going to need a lot more people cavness saidmeanwhile government regulations and incentives are in the offing that could benefit oil and cryptocurrency companiesthe us senate passed a measure in april to reverse former president donald trumps weakening of methane emission regulations that could fuel the use of bitcoin mining to cut flaring academic experts said lawmakers in texas and new mexico also are looking to crack down on emissionsnorth dakota and wyoming this year passed laws that give tax breaks to oil producers that provide gas to cryptocurrency and other data miners that would otherwise have been flared“i think it’s gonna be a big chunk at what we look at for the future in north dakota” said state senator dale patten who authored north dakota’s billour standards the thomson reuters trust principles
