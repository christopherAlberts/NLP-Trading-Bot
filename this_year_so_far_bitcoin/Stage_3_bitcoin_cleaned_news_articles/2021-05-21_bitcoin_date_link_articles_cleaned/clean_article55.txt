as we have said on multiple occasions selling tends to come in waves and today seems to be no different however some of this selling is driven by option expiry for  where  contracts will expireoptions expiration spells an awful weekend for bullswe think the bears will continue to leverage this expiry and a lot of long call options are set to go worthless which will wipe out a lot of traders given the  drop in btc on the friday session with btc currently trading at  at the time of writingaccording to marcel pechman from cointelegraphout of the  call options only  have been created using  and lower strikes this means the remaining  became worthless as there are less than  hours left for the weekly expiry therefore the  neutraltobullish call options below  represent a  million open interestmarcel pechman from cointelegraph goes onto explain put option open interest“overall the put options at  and higher amount to  million in open interest the  million difference favoring the more neutraltobearish options is a decent advantage as we approach friday’s expiry”our view we’ve mostly been bearish on bitcoin for the past couple weeks as it seems the market has been extended for quite some time and it was only a matter of time before bullish sentiment would turn negativefigure  bitcoin price chartsource coinmarketcapbitcoin continues to bleed lower heading into the friday session as it drops  from  to retest  currently because of the options expiry with bears likely to earn profits on expiry we think it’s time to anticipate a pretty awful weekend for bitcoin holders with the coin capable of reaching beyond the elon musk tweets it seems like a number of investment managers are also skeptical of bitcoin michael novogratz galaxy global digital on cnbc mentioned “it did feel like pretty big capitulation today it’s not going to bounce right back it will consolidate for a while” this was in reference to may   sellingfigure  bitcoin market dominancesource coinmarketcapbtc dominance continues to trend lower and it’s mainly because bitcoin seems to be dropping a lot more quickly than some of the other coins on the market this is a pretty negative precursor for alt coins as btc dominance in the  range implies that it’s only going to go up eventually and that’s primarily because alt holders eventually swap to btc as market losses ripple further outhence btc dominance trended up to like  from the beginning of  as the rest of the alt market more or less retreated so we’re starting to get to that blip or turning point where the rest of the coins eventually drop in value and the value of btc goes up disproportionately in value in relation to the rest of the marketbears control the market currentlygiven this eventuality we think bears have wrestled control over the market for the time being and the last bear market was from january  to january  which lasted the entirety of a yearwe think speculators should probably wait for a better entry point in the markets as this retreat will continue for a lot longer than bulls might anticipate not to mention the recent option expiration only adds further negative bias to market
