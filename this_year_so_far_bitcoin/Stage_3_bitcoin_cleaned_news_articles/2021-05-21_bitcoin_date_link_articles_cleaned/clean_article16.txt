bitcoin cryptobtc and other cryptocurrencies have fallen sharply in price from the highs they reached just a few weeks ago bitcoin reached an alltime high near  in midapril on friday morning the worlds largest digital currency was worth about  a steep decline of more than  in just five weeksfor bitcoin newcomers this crypto crash is probably pretty scary however this drop isnt surprising to those who know bitcoins history here are a couple things you need to know to put the current crash into perspective bitcoin has crashed beforetodays crypto crash is nothing new bitcoin has crashed  or more three different times since  according to visual capitalist with this context we see that the current  drop is rather mild by comparisonfor the record it can be problematic to study stocks based on their chart patterns known as technical analysis after all shares represent small ownership stakes in realworld businesses over time businesses grow mature and evolve sometimes they even fail for these reasons and more stocks dont always behave predictablyby contrast cryptocurrencies arent businesses yes blockchain networks  the digital ledger technology on which cryptocurrencies are based  can be adopted for realworld applications but blockchains differ from one another and even when blockchain technologies gain wider acceptance this doesnt always guarantee their associated digital currencies will increase in valuerather cryptocurrencies are a simple case of supply and demand in my opinion if demand for coins outpaces supply prices go up therefore i believe looking at the historical pattern from bitcoins chart may be helpfulwith bitcoin demand is hard to predict but past crashes occurred when longterm utility was called into question for example bitcoin had a sharp pullback when china first announced restrictions for cryptocurrencies in  similarly the current crash is being helped along by new clarifications from china  its citizens now cant use it as a form of payment from time to time other countries propose similar limitations for cryptocurrencies as wellwhenever something puts bitcoins longterm future in doubt demand is temporarily stifled and a crash ensues and if the current crash follows the historical pattern  a drop of  or more  bitcoin still has a long way to fall from where it is right now from its previous high an  drop would take bitcoin down to around  bitcoin has always bounced backaccording to its protocol bitcoins supply is fixed at  million coins there are currently around  million in existence but new bitcoins are mined and put in circulation on a continual basis right now there are about  new bitcoins released every day as new blocks are minedhowever about every four years the bitcoin reward for mining is cut in half this is called a halving event at launch miners were awarded  bitcoins with each new block but there have now been three halving events taking the current reward down to  bitcoin per block previous halving events occurred on nov   july   and may  going into  many bitcoin holders were expecting big gains from cryptocurrencies looking at the past some of the best years for bitcoin were  and  immediately following the halving event this held true in  and it makes sense assuming demand is ongoing the new limits on supply drive the price higher but eventually prices spike high enough to limit demand and the price falls againno one knows the future so no one can say whether bitcoin is going up or down in the near term however i would say the odds are high that the price of bitcoin will be higher following the next halving event which is expected in  halvings have tended to be catalysts in the pasta final warningunfortunately most people arent thinking so longterm when it comes to bitcoin as reported by coindesk the recent crash caused  billion in forced liquidations on may  alone because investors had purchased bitcoin using marginpaying for any investment with borrowed money is a bad idea  especially one with a history of wild volatility if it goes up margin can admittedly compound your gains but the opposite is true as wellif bitcoins history teaches us anything its to expect the unexpected if youre willing to hold a small position for the long term as part of a diversified portfolio then i would say buy some bitcoin but dont buy today hoping to get rich quick history shows therell be sharp and lengthy setbacks along the way
