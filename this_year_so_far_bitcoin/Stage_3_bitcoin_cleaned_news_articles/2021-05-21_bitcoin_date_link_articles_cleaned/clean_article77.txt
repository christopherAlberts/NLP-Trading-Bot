may  price crash in the bitcoin btc spot market wiped about  billion worth of longleveraged positions from cryptocurrency derivatives marketsleveraged bullish investors winded up around  billion in longs on may  source bybtthe event marked the biggest bullish leverage wipeout since march  retail and institutional investors borrowed from leading exchanges to amplify their potential returnsbut a sudden reversal in bitcoin spot rates reportedly led by elon musks antibitcoin tweets over the weekend and fueled by chinas reiteration of a ban on crypto transactions blew up bulls leverage ratios that led to a socalled liquidity cascade in the derivatives marketin traditional markets investors use cash as collateral to back their leveraged bets but the cryptocurrency industry enables

for a  price target for bitcoinbut the mindboggling long liquidation event has not made everyone bearish on the contrary some analysts have highlighted the wipeout as a catalyst for the next big bullish setup in the bitcoin marketfor instance pseudonymous trader twitterati  posted a long thread on twitter explaining why he thinks a drop in open interest has made bitcoin stronger in the long runmoneymakerstwitterati  highlighted the role of market makers in running a cryptocurrency derivatives platform the analyst explained how their strategies assisted in transferring bitcoin from weaker hands to stronger hands during the may  dipin retrospect the bitcoin futures market is typically excessively long that prompts market makers to gain exposure on the other side of the bullish trades so they open short positionsbut that does not necessarily make the liquidity providers bearish they prefer to back up their short positions by hedging in spot markets by purchasing btc or other bullish derivatives exposure options futures perpetual swaps etcsometimes said twitterati  theres hedgeshort demand hitting the market maker too so that the market maker can sell their shorts back to them but generally in crypto its longbiased and thus market maker holds  spot as collateral to their shortsthe analyst added that market makers buy spot coins against high leverage demand from bulls noting that leveraged long position holders are the weakest possible hands — most vulnerable to liquidations should the spot bitcoin rate turn lowerwhen the long liquidation occurs market makers close their shorts against them to provide liquidity they also sell their spot positions to remain neutraland during a long liquidation heavy move the mm constantly get hit by longs closing so now they have to close their shorts against them to provide liquidity while selling spot to remain neutral to unwind this entire process — cl  may  the trader explained what happened on may  when roughly  billion worth of long positions was liquidated as bitcoins price fell from nearly  to  within three hours but then the btcusd exchange rate quickly recovered back to at the same time the bitcoin futures open interest did not follow the spot price recoverybitcoin price recovers while futures open interest stays low source tradingviewthis means we just had the most significant weak hands to strong hands transfer in probably since march   noted twitterati  adding that strong hands with real cash bought btc on the cheap from market makers he saidthese coins have now transferred from shortterm leverage speculators to real cash buyerswho are the strong bitcoin handsmeanwhile analyst willy woo wrote in his latest newsletter that longterm prospects in the bitcoin market remain healthy reiterating what fellow trader twitterati  highlighted in his twitter thread that the coins are going into the pockets of longterm investorsa longterm investor in the bitcoin market or a hodler is typically an entity

raised fears of inflationfor instance the united states federal reserve announced last year that it wants to push inflation above  the central bank has been maintaining a policy of nearzero interest rates and has been buying  billion worth of government bonds and mortgagebacked securities every monththere is no need for bitcoin to replace fiat currencies to maintain value completely said vincenzo furcillo a risk analyst at seeking alpha he addeddespite the possible volatility the projections show a positive skew over the next five years in small proportions bitcoin should find space as a strategic investment in the portfolio of investors looking to hedge to upcoming inflation
