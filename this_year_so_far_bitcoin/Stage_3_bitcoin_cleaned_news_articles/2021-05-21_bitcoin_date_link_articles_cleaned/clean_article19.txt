knapp managing partner of ironsides macroeconomics in any of the little disturbances we are getting about a  to  pullback knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies you should be in the cyclical parts of tech he said knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing reboundtech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week gaining  but semiconductors popped nearly  software was up  the nasdaq was  higher on the week to  while the dow was off a half

 it wouldnt shock me if we went straight back to new highs knapp said part of the reason i thought we would trade in a range was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging he said earnings for the sp  are now expected to be up  more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began knapp expects the fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its jackson hole meeting in late summer and that is the likely trigger for a correction back to world war ii he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the fed normalizing policy last cycle we had eight of those he said every attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events knapp said its natural for investors to be focused on the fed now its an uncertainty shock he said it will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it the fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic knapp said treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending but he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit the bitcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from washington and the infrastructure spending could be positive the thing that was the surprise in  that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout he said noting bitcoin gained on the potential for inflation and big deficit spendingweek ahead
