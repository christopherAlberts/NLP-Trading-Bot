jill carlson slow ventures venture partner joins yahoo finance live to discuss how bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are faring amid the china mining crackdownvideo transcriptzack guzman i want to shift over to the move that we are seeing in bitcoin here easing some of those losses here a bit slightly now under  in terms of the losses today that were seeing around that  price level we got the update out of china headlines coming around potential issues and bans even in terms of mining which would be a step up from some of the stuff we saw before this week around using cryptocurrencies in transactions reiteration of the policies thats been in place since but when we look at maybe the institutional players buying the dip want to highlight data that we have here from glassnode take a look at the onchain metrics that point out wallets associated with overthecounter desks when bitcoins price tanked earlier on wednesday and thursday the number of daily transfers from those otc desks rose tenfold they hit a high not seen in about four months time the cofounders of glassnode cited that institutional support as reasons for retail investors out there to hold through the painand for more on where were at in the week that was i want to bring on jill carlson a partner at tech and blockchainfocused vc firm slow ventures she joins us right now jill appreciate you being here i mean i feel like i aged  years in the last week i dont know about you but were still standing here still in that mid  level range maybe close to the  moving average around  but whats your take on where we sit right now given all the fud out therejill carlson just another week in crypto right i like to joke that crypto years are like dog years they always tend to be sort of  what you would get in any other market and that was certainly true this week look i mean i think that its an important point to focus on institutions versus retail here i think its not at all a coincidence that we are back to about the price that we were at before elon musk first came in and tweeted about bitcoin back at the end of january were back in the mid story continuesand you know if you look at the rally that led up to that date it was all institutional driven and that was a significant rally in and of itself that was already up  on the year and were up more than that still were holding those gains the retracement that weve seen has really been about retail capitulation and in the grand scheme of things if you look at the money that matters its going to be on the institutional side and not the retail sidezack guzman yeah and just lastly too or i mean not lastly but next on the topic of china and in mining right because that was maybe potentially also a factor in the intense selloff we saw earlier in the week this time around a distinction maybe to highlight in terms of bitcoin mining and just to kind of throw it out there when we highlight the actual technology there behind bitcoin i mean were talking about miners that could come on and take up the hash rate left by chinese minersand you highlight the issues elon musk had to raise that kind of sparked this and the sustainability issues if you shift away from some of the miners using coal perhaps that would seem to me a boost in terms of addressing some of those sustainability concerns that would not necessarily impact the network itself so whats your take on maybe how it could be a positive if it were to happenjill carlson yeah no thats right and i mean first we should acknowledge that every six months or so in this industry you get a china headline that spooks the market without fail its like clockwork and so you know to some degree for those of us whove been around this industry for a while now we see this headline and we say ok again its just kind of another day in crypto well see how real this china fear isbut as you rightly point out i think over the long term it could be a real net positive it could drive a lot of the bitcoin mining power back into the united states back into other areas where there is more reliance on renewables and other sources of energy versus china where again a lot of it is as you pointed out coal and that could help assuage a lot of the fears that have come up around bitcoin thanks again to elon musks tweet earlier this week or late last week around tesla being concerned about bitcoins clean capacityakiko fujita is that a real sort of material concern though i mean when we talk about those who are holding bitcoin trading i mean are they really concerned about the environmental issues i mean how significant a risk is thatjill carlson look i mean i could sit here and i could give you all kinds of stats around  of bitcoin miners out there to rely to some degree on renewables so on and so forth in terms of whether investors actually care investors care about sentiment and so to the degree that sentiment has actually shifted around bitcoin and other proof of work coins that would be problematic for investors rightand tesla needs to maintain its status as an esg stock tesla needs to maintain its relationship with government and status as an environmental player for all kinds of grants there are other companies corporate treasuries and funds that go in that same category but again i think it comes back to sentiment fundamentally and one thing that ill be keeping an eye on is whether or not bitcoin trades in line with the broader crypto market with a lot of the proof of stake coins and other consensus mechanisms that are less energy intensive or whether bitcoin and the proof of work coins continue to trade more weakly than thosezack guzman yeah and jill lastly i liked one of your tweets here that kind of put in perspective as you say its like dog years and you can go back and look at maybe some big dips before granted weve seen you know   collapses in a bull market before when you go back to  or even before but when you look at where were at right now and this is kind of one of those things that i like stressing on the show bitcoin and cryptocurrencies maybe a bit unique there in terms of the benefits of holding through some of this volatility whats your advice to maybe newcomers out there who arent maybe used to that volatility and what you see in terms of the benefits relative to other asset classes when it comes to just holding it through all thisjill carlson yeah no i think the commentary that i provided earlier this week that youre referencing was im not even sure it appears on that graph thats on the screen right now but if you zoom all the way back to  and that was when i got into this market you know bought in the price skyrocketed up to  crashed bounced back crashed again you know its the nature of emerging technology its the nature of this form of investing its going to be volatileand you know i think that the principle i would have going into any position is dont buy more than you can afford to lose which a lot of people did last week and in the leadup to this when we look at the liquidations and the number of retail accounts that got liquidated that is problematic we dont want that much leverage in this market it exacerbates this volatility and so i think overall this cleanout is healthy and my advice would be if you can hold and if you cant you should really reevaluate your positions
