cooper turley first started investing in cryptocurrency four years ago bitcoin currently the largest crypto by market value was trading at over  at the time according to coinmarketcap ether which is powered by the ethereum blockchain and is the second largest crypto by market value was trading at a few hundred dollars turley bought both now turley tells cnbc make it those early investments have made him a millionaire growing to be worth seven figures with  of that generated in the last two years cnbc could not independently confirm documents detailing the transactions and current value of turleys crypto holdings i definitely dont feel like ive made it by any stretch — there are far more people who are far better off than me in crypto but i do feel really thankful says turley  though turley declined to disclose exactly how much he initially invested it was not a lot at all he says at that point i was still in college working some ad hoc jobs i was just putting a couple hundred dollars in here and therei fell down this rabbit holeturley says he first invested in ethereum while studying music business at the university of colorado denver in  he learned that the ethereum blockchain has the potential to change the music industry and help artists take more control over their own music — for instance smart contracts on the blockchain could do things like expedite royalty payments directly to creators from there i fell down this rabbit hole of being fascinated by how the technology works and how i could make a name for myself and become an expert on the industry as a whole he saysonce turley graduated in  he got more serious about his cryptocurrency portfolio he says even though both bitcoin and ether had recently plunged in value in  i saw my net worth basically come crashing down he says it was during the midst of two to three years when everyone kind of wrote it off that i was really heavily investing putting basically all of my income just into ether  around like  of course this was a very risky move — even today experts warn to only invest money into crypto that you can afford to lose cryptocurrencies are volatile speculative investments but turley stuck with it for me in  i saw this turning point where  was a shift away from speculation to actually building usable products he says by this turley is referring to the capabilities of the ethereum blockchain as it is used to power the creation of different decentralized applications like defi or decentralized finance and assets like nfts or nonfungible tokensdiving into defiturley felt that he had done enough research to understand what he was getting into he says im entirely selftaught — i started interacting with the ethereum network a lot more turley says i became fascinated with learning who the key players were and staying up on the latest trends one of those trends was defi defi apps aim to recreate traditional financial systems with cryptocurrency through defi lending for instance users can loan out cryptocurrency as a traditional bank does with fiat currency and earn interest as a lender except with defi its very risky still turley says he lent his ether and other digital coins and began to collect interest turley also made an even riskier play borrowing coins himself so that he could then lend even more all of this is known as yield farming and its extremely complex and risky for one theres not much protection if someone defaults on your loan in defi loan borrowers provide collateral with other cryptoassets as the process is nearly anonymous however unlike with a traditional bank borrowers using defi apps cannot be held accountable otherwise if unable to effectively pay back a loan indeed there are many risks associated with defi including its lack of regulation and user protections — between january and april for example  million was stolen from defi related hacks according to ciphertrace the old crypto saying dont put in more than you can afford to lose goes double for defi according to coin desk this stuff is ubercomplex and a lot can go wrong but turley says he has been experimenting with that sector for a long time so i felt very confident about making sure that i was checking in on how healthy my loan was he says in  turley experienced largely the most profitable few months of my career he says which was during whats known as defi summer at the time there was a surge of technology being created within the space and investor interest with billions of dollars locked in defi applications since then turley has continued to invest and generate returns from defi he says while also working a number of jobs within the crypto space its a running joke at this point that i have an infinite number of jobs in crypto turley says  just work on too many things now turley lives in los angeles and works in crypto strategy at ethereumbased streaming app audius he is also an angel investor in the space he says and acts as an advisor for variant fund a crypto venture firm  have contributed to  plus crypto projects he says and am an investor in   crypto projectspaying off debt
