as  although it rebounded to  bitcoins value remains more than a third lower than its alltime high of  notched in aprilthe downdraft has reduced bitcoins total value by roughly  billion according to coinmarketcapcom while ethereum and other cryptocurrencies have also slumped the sudden decline is undermining the case bitcoin bulls make for why even average investors should take a chance on cryptocurrenciescrypto doesnt replace the dollarone of the main arguments bitcoin proponents make is that digital currencies represent a cheaper more efficient way of doing business the problem only a very small number of people are using bitcoin to buy goods and servicesin  the average number of purchases made with bitcoin cracked  a day for the first time five years later that figure is only modestly higher there have been an average of  transactions a day in bitcoin in the past month according to blockchaincom and that likely includes many transactions in which one bitcoin investor is trading bitcoins with anotherits hard to say how that compares to the number of daily transactions conducted in dollars however there are nearly  million credit card transactions alone in the us per day that suggests the number of bitcoin transactions amount to a tiny fraction of overall consumer spendingearly on bitcoin supporters used to say transactions would rise as more businesses began accepting cryptocurrencies for payment and today a growing number of retailers do take bitcoin square venmo and paypal all support bitcoin as a payment method while mastercard has said it will soon allow crypto paymentsfor now however that hasnt moved the needle muchi am not seeing wide adoption of bitcoin as a currency dan dolev who covers the fintech industry and cryptocurrencies for mizuho securities told cbs moneywatch i think it is going to be an uphill battle to make it as something that people use to buy thingscrypto isnt a good store of value or inflation hedgeanother reason some boosters predicted the popularity of bitcoin and therefore its price would take off is because it was supposedly a safe place to put your money the logic was that the total number of available bitcoins which is finite and capped at  million is much smaller than the the supply of dollars that many crypto believers argued would cause the price of bitcoin to rise steadily over time but bitcoin has been anything but steady with its price prone to booms and busts although the value of bitcoin and other cryptos have risen the huge swings in price — rising and falling by thousands of dollars a day — highlights their risks as an investmentother people have said that bitcoin like gold is a good hedge against inflation but in the past few weeks as inflation fears have risen the price of bitcoin has droppedi am not a believer or a disbeliever dolev said today there are a lot of people who bought cryptos at a higher price and are underwater the question is are they willing to wait it out or are they going to cut their lossescrypto isnt really globalanother common refrain from bitcoin bulls cryptocurrencies are a global financial asset that in theory should make it easier and cheaper to transact business with anyone in the world in reality the cryptocurrency market has run into the same problems as other currencies — namely that different countries have different rules governing what transactions are allowed this week china banned domestic banks and other financial institutions from supporting bitcoin that means they are not allowed to process payments made in the cryptocurrency or allow bank customers to hold bitcoin in their accounts chinese banks are also barred from converting bitcoin into yuan or any other currency elsewhere banks are also barred from dealing in bitcoin in much of the middle east in the us regulators appear to be leaning toward more actively monitoring cryptocurrencies on thursday the treasury department said it would require businesses to report any bitcoin payment over  citing an effort to crack down on tax evasion gary gensler the new chairman if the securities and exchange commission recently told cnbc that while he understands why people want to invest in bitcoin the cryptocurrency market needs to be better regulated before that can happen more broadly i think that we need greater investor protection there he
