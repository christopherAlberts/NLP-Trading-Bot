a few weeks back i offered my two cents on bitcoin and other cryptocurrency and why i thought they would be lousy investments in a  plani own bitcoin and other crypto investments i buy and sell nba top shot nonfungible tokens nfts i’m creating a business with some friends and offering nft trading cards yet they are a terrible investment to offer in  plans i am a seasoned investor with a longterm buy and hold but the typical investor in a  plan isn’t seasoned doesn’t understands dollarcost averaging and will lock in losses when any investment goes down substantially in addition cryptocurrency lacks the regulations that mutual funds and stocks havecryptocurrency trading is very volatile and the last thing that any  sponsor needs are a participant that puts in all their money in crypto and panics when there is a selloff we can afford to be aggressive in our outside investments we can’t afford that aggressiveness in  plans
