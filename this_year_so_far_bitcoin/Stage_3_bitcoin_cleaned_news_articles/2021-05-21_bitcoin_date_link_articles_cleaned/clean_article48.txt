youll often hear that its important to save consistently for retirement because youll need the money to cover your living expenses and when we think about the costs seniors face from housing to healthcare its easy to see whynot only must you save well for retirement but you should also invest your savings in a manner that generates solid growth the reason inflation has the potential to erode your buying power over time but if your investments generate a highenough return you can outpace inflation and wind up with enough money to cover all of your senior living expenses and then somein fact you may be eager to buy bitcoin cryptobtc as part of your longterm retirement strategy  especially in light of rumors that social security may fizzle out by the time your senior years arrive but is bitcoin really a solid and safer betbitcoin vs social security who winsgiven the direction in which social security is headed and the potential to make money with bitcoin you may find yourself asking whether it pays to give up the former and focus on the latter but the reality is that you dont need to pit the two against each other because both bitcoin and social security have the potential to provide a large retirement payday and both also have the potential to let you downfirst lets talk bitcoin like other cryptocurrencies bitcoin can be very volatile and whether it can really grow in value steadily over the next number of decades is yet to be determinedremember bitcoin has only been around since  and while more merchants are coming to accept it as a means of payment for the most part thats not the norm as such its hard to predict whether bitcoin will gain enough value to provide a viable retirement income stream and if youre the riskaverse type you may not want too much of it in your portfolionow lets talk social security the program is facing its share of financial challenges and in the coming years it may need to cut benefits to compensate clearly that wouldnt be a good thing also social security has over the past couple of decades done a poor job of helping seniors maintain their buying power in the face of inflationbut the one good thing about social security is that its not at risk of disappearing completely even if benefits are reduced thats not the same thing as them going away in full on the other hand theres a chance that bitcoin could be worth next to nothing in   or  years timeshould you buy bitcoin if youre worried about social securityif youre concerned that social security wont pay you a highenough benefit to stay afloat in retirement then saving and investing on your own is crucial but is bitcoin the right investment to make up for it maybe but not necessarilybitcoin is extremely risky so if your goal is to set yourself up with an income stream outside of social security it may not be the thing you want to focus on rather a safer bet  safer being a relative term  may be to load up on stocks in your portfolio and shift toward bonds as retirement nears though stocks certainly have the potential to lose value over time if we look at the markets history its clear that generally doesnt happentake the sp  index for example despite the many hits its taken its still managed to deliver solid returns over time  and its also managed to recover from crashes bitcoin hasnt been around that long so its hard to say how well it will hold up through the yearstheres nothing wrong with putting some money into bitcoin in the hopes that it will do a better job than social security of helping you attain and maintain buying power as a senior but it shouldnt be your only longterm investment  whether youve lost faith in social security or not
