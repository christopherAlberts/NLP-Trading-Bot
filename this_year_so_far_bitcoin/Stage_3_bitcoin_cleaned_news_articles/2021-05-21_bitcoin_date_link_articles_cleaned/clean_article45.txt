climate change is becoming a major financial liability for bitcoin tesla ceo elon musk said on may  that the company will no longer accept the cryptocurrency as payment over concerns “about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions” other organizations may follow suit greenpeace became the latest on may  telling the financial times that it will stop accepting bitcoin for donations which it has done since bitcoin mining globally uses about as much electricity as the nation of argentina producing a similar volume of greenhouse gas emissions to the london metro area the reason for the big footprint is rooted in how bitcoins are “mined” fleets of computers compete to unlock coins by solving increasingly difficult math problems a computational methodology known as proofofwork in this method the only way to get an advantage over other miners is to run more computers more efficiently an approach that is energyintensive by design and can only become more so over time some bitcoin proponents like twitter cofounder jack dorsey have argued that the cryptocurrency can promote clean energy consumption by becoming a cornerstone customer for big solar and wind farms but for the moment most of the power for bitcoin mining is delivered by coalfired power plants in china and hydropower dams—and no matter where it comes from it’s an awful lot of energy to use on a service that benefits only a tiny niche group of speculatorsa better solution would be to scrap proofofwork altogether—which is exactly what ether a currency that runs on a network called ethereum bitcoin’s chief rival in the cryptocurrency scene is planning to domining an environmentfriendly cryptocurrencyin a blog post may  carl beekhuizen a researcher at the ethereum foundation a nonprofit that helps organize the currency’s community of miners programmers and investors asserted that the currency’s longplanned shift to a new computational method will shave  off its energy consumption which is already much lower than bitcoin because of the smaller size of its market in a colorful analogy beekhuizen writes that if the energy demand of bitcoin were represented as the height of the burj khalifa the world’s tallest building then ethereum’s new energy demand could be compared to a single screwthe new method already in use by some other cryptocurrencies is called proofofstake under this method access to new coins is restricted based on how many coins a miner already owns if a miner owns  of all coins they can access only  of new coins this system eliminates the need for energyintensive numbercrunching because a miner’s rate of coin access is a product of their “stake” not of their “work” as a result proofofstake mining software can essentially work on one normal computer rather than a warehouse of servers and there is no longer any strategic need to consume an increasing amount of energythe proofofstake transition is riskywhether ethereum can pull off this transition known among insiders as the merge remains uncertain beekhuizen is vague about when the merge will occur “the upcoming months” because no one individual or group can simply push a button and make it happen to work all ether miners beekhuizen estimates there are about  will need to update their systems at the same time said alex de vries a digital currency researcher if they don’t—because of miscommunication active resistance to the concept or any reason—the ethereum market could splinter this has happened before in august  a disagreement among bitcoin miners and developers over the maximum transaction rate precipitated a split with a minority going off to form a new currency called bitcoin cashwhile the technical details of such a split are complex the upshot is simple if it doesn’t work ether’s value could suffer and people who own ethereumbased nonfungibletokens could risk losing them de vries said“there’s reason for people to be afraid about doing it” he said “it’s going to create some interesting work for the lawyers”if the merge works it could increase pressure on bitcoin to follow suit with a much larger and more diverse global community the odds that bitcoin miners could come to consensus on a proofofstake transition are slim—but climate concern could tip the scales“if you are a bitcoiner today you’ve made tons of money over the past year the past few days have been bad but yeartodate you’re still in a lot of profit why would you change a winning thing” de vries said “but if bitcoin keeps going down in value because it’s attracting negative headlines or because elon musk is cracking down on it then people might change their mind about that especially if they see that ethereum succeeds”
