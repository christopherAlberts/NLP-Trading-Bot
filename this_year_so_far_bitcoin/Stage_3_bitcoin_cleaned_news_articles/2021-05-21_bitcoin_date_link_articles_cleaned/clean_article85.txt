again we witness emotions such as fear greed and uncertainty hovering over one crore indian investors that together hold approximately rs  crore worth of cryptocurrencies as of february  there are so many questions that need to be answered and this is my attempt to share some of the important ones to help understand what’s happening in this crypto spaceis bitcoin too good to ignore or a bubble waiting to burst some  years ago people used to assume our share market was a place for gambling who knows the crypto market could be the next internet and it is already becoming too big to ignore one should not ridicule it without understanding this first always remember that first come the innovations followed by the regulations you can start to learn and understand what the crypto market is all about and wait for the government to come up with regulations before you plan to invest in itshould we call it a currencyit is better to call it an asset like a commodity because to call it a currency it requires to be stable and possess value which is not the case at the moment however some corporations across the globe have started accepting bitcoins as a mode of paymentso is it an assetwell until it is recognised by the regulatory authorities we can treat it as a commodity like gold silver or stock its value comes from its scarcity like gold only  million bitcoins could ever be in circulation making it a scarce commodityas you know your stock or gold is not a legal tender meaning you cannot trade your gold or stocks in a store against your purchases your crypto asset is unlike

stock market globally that works for a specific time period during weekdays the second factor is that a global community is involved in trading or investing in it unlike stock markets which are more countryspecific imagine what would happen if bse and nse were allowed to open  and people across the world were interested in investing won’t you find similar volatility there as well stock markets are less volatile as compared to the crypto market which as suggested earlier would stabilise once it finds more takers and favoured regulationswhat you should know before you plan to invest in
