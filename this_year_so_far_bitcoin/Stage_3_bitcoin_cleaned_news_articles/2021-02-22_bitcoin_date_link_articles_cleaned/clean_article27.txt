on a hot day in december  i was sitting in a filledup keke ‚Äî commercial tricycle ‚Äî totally detesting what lay ahead of me it was thursday the  a day after the federal government ordered nigerians to link their national identification number nins to their sims or get blockedthough it did not make sense that i was heading for ikotun ‚Äî one of many busy and crowded locations in lagos nigeria ‚Äî after the country was hit by the second wave of  there i was without a choice overcome by regret for not seizing the opportunity to register in  i questioned the logic behind the directive as the keke weaved its way through trafficgiven the urgency of the situation i was not surprised to see a lot of people at the local council office making my way up the stairs of the unremarkable national identity management commission nimc building where the nin registration was taking place i harboured fears of a crowd and a long queuemy fears gave way to reality when i got to the office there was a long queue with people who clung to each other as if to close spaces that less patient people would exploit as they pushed throughadvertisementinterestingly the crowd was at a decent distance one metre is my best guess from the nimc office door very few people were wearing masks a surprisingly friendly staff stood at the entrance addressing questions from random people ironically a sign on the door boldly read ‚Äúno mask ‚Äì no entry‚Äùcalmly the staff explained that the following week‚Äôs list was filled on friday the week before‚Äúwhat when next should i come then‚Äù‚Äútomorrow‚Äù he said staring right into my saucerwide eyes‚Äúand make sure you come as early as  am‚Äù he concludedtheir goal ‚Äî crowd management at the centre ‚Äî was an exercise in futilityi got there just before eight the following morning and this time an unfriendly staff firmly told me to come back in january advertisementas i slowly made my way back home there were questions on my mind how did we get here why is the government doing this what will be the consequence of such a movesome context on ninafrica‚Äôs economy is growing increasingly digital and the pandemic already promises to bring longlasting changes access to widespread digital identity is a key component of digital change and the ability to identify a person has ripple effects on sectors like health banking and educationfor the past  years nigeria ‚Äî africa‚Äôs most populous country ‚Äî has struggled to have a central database with data either nonexistent or little and far between at least that‚Äôs the impression that dealing with any government agency will leave you withhowever titi akinsami a digital economy and policy expert begs to differ she insists that even without a driver‚Äôs licence a passport or voter‚Äôs card data exists albeit scattered across different places and often unaccounted for‚Äúone way or another you must have been captured by the government‚Äù she says ‚Äúit‚Äôs either in your schools your local governments or your health centres‚Äùwhen the government needed to distribute palliatives at the heart of the pandemic the lack of a central database was a clear stumbling block despite the issues behind the quest for digital identity nigeria‚Äôs ministry of communications and the digital economy decided to take drastic actionon december   the nigerian communications commission ncc ordered all mobile subscribers to link their national identification number nin to their subscriber identification module sim cards people without nins were to quickly register or risk being blocked by december  at the time of this order there were  million mobile subscribers and  million registered nins this seemingly sudden move was the outcome of months of ministerial orders and regulatory directivesthe warning signswhen dr isa pantami assumed office as the minister of communications he championed the ministry‚Äôs renaming to the ministry of communications and the digital economy he set targets for the ncc and the national information technology development agency nitda among other agencies under its supervisionin response the ncc blocked  million sim cards with the help of telecom companies and deactivated improperly registered simsthe ncc ordering millions of mtn subscribers to redo their sim registrations in september  should have been a major warning signdue to poor service high call and data charges and less than decent network coverage the average nigerian has at least three sim cards from various network providers others also patronise isps and sometimes have separate sims for calls and internet accessaccording to the ncc the average nigerian subscriber has at least  to  sims registered being one such average nigerian it‚Äôs disheartening to observe that quality internet remains a dream in most parts of nigeria despite having several optionsthe ncc planned to regularise data from subscribers holding multiple sims to provide a clear picture of nigeria‚Äôs unique mobile subscribers however nothing much has come of this as nigerians would later learnin february  the minister set a december   deadline for subscribers to link their sim cards with their nin he also stated that they could not hold more than three sims going forward my colleague oluwanifemi kolawole explained that meeting the new requirements would be challenging given nigeria‚Äôs peculiar circumstancesthe country struggled economically as the pandemic hit hard in march  a lockdown was initiated hundreds of people died thousands were hospitalised and nothing much was said of the ninsim linkage in light of the rampaging pandemicon august   the presidency approved the transfer of the nigerian identity management commission nimc previously a standalone agency to the ministry of communications and the digital economythe important but elusive nina central citizens‚Äô database comes with several benefits that can help the nigerian government improve healthcare security welfare policies and educationthis data is also important to innovators entrepreneurs and for research and developmentthe bank verification number bvn launched in  has been the focal point for most financial innovation in recent years a case in point is this hackathon where a team of developers worked to use soundwaves for lastmile paymentsknow your customer kyc and identity verification have long been a tough nut to crack for companies and governments at the time of launch the bvn seemed like a duplication of effort considering that the nin which the government kickstarted in  would serve the same purposeadedeji olowe trium networks ceo believes that if the nin exercise is successful it could replace the bvn as a critical piece for financial innovationthe ict ministry has all but confirmed that the nin would replace the bvn insisting that while the former is backed by law the latter is merely a banking policy i explored this more with an admittedly long piece on the february   edition of techpoint digestthe government has made the nin a prerequisite to retrieve lost sim cards shop on global ecommerce platforms like amazon and aliexpress and more importantly get your driver‚Äôs licence and international passportfurther perspective the disruptorthe nigeria centre for disease control ncdc confirmed subsaharan africa‚Äôs first  case on february   in lagos nigeria and wasted no time assuring nigerians that it had put emergency measures in place to contain the spread quicklyand this seemed to be the case in march and april  when the country was in lockdown nigeria had only  confirmed cases by the end of april  but this figure raised questions how much testing was being done in the country how many people have access to decent health facilities across the nationnonetheless everyone tuned in to the ncdc‚Äôs twitter account every evening to get live updates it became the subject of several jokes as people tried to cope with the reality of  if western juggernauts like the us could barely manage what hope did the largest black nation havewith necessity came innovation from startups like  helium health and flying doctors nigeria with interesting creations like testing booths and laboratory analysis of the strange viruscompanies went fully remote and events of all sizes went online as platforms like zoom google meet and microsoft team began to gain widespread popularityin lagos nigeria‚Äôs most populous state the lockdown had to be eased gradually as it recorded the most cases of  during this period as of april  lagos had  cases compared to  in kano ‚Äî the secondworst hit statethe geography of affected states has changed drastically since thenwhen the government eased the lockdown on may    cases rose by  to  by the end of the monthin the following months nigeria paid the price for easing the lockdown as  cases more than doubled once more to  in june by october  this number had reached despite this alarming increase the government seemingly weighed the impact on the country‚Äôs economy as i explored before msmes make up the bulk of nigeria‚Äôs businesses most of which are not captured by the corporate affairs commission caca few embraced tech solutions to keep running their businesses but for all the progress of recent years internet penetration leaves much to be desired with job losses salary cuts a difficult credit landscape and  hardship not many had the luxury to innovate nigerians had to survive by returning to their daily means of livelihood and nin registrationa chat with some nigerians living in different states revealed sordid tales of long queues stress bribery and corruption at nimc registration centresi have paid  remita to government sworn affidavit wrote a letter send all requested since december  nothing as been done yet only unknown officer asking  to get it donewhy  ‚Äî üò†  february  a month before the nin ultimatum the ncdc‚Äôs  stats had stopped attracting attention the infection numbers had thankfully dropped to record lows and economic activities were slowly resuming but in december the numbers skyrocketed the second wave was no longer a threat it was now a reality in nigeriathroughout november  nigeria recorded  cases but this number increased by  to  in december by the end of january  the country hit over  cases a  increase from the previous monththe numbers get even more disheartening when you consider the  cases in the days following the government‚Äôs nin ordera month before nigerians were asked to get their nins the nation recorded   cases but a month after that order it recorded a whopping  cases a worrying  increasethe west african giant has seen a scary  cases in the  days following the commencement of nin registration  days before this nigeria had just  cases in other words  cases have increased by  since the nin registrations commencednigeria averaged  daily cases before the nin scramble currently it averages  cases dailythe shocker since the first  case was reported nigeria has confirmed a saddening  more cases over  of which have come since the nin announcementas i write this possible logical flaws that might arise from concluding confront me when trying to escape the post hoc fallacy we have to note that event b happening after event a does not mean event a caused event bconsequently we have to consider what else could be responsible for the spike in december  did the disease control agency begin to test more did people become more careless did careless parties begin in earnestrecall how i squeezed myself into a tricycle on the way to the nimc office that has been going on for months you would also witness large crowds in lagos during trips to the ikeja computer village and any popular lagos marketon the days these markets are permitted to open people troop in to get business done before closing between  and  pmthe endsars protests held in october  and one could assume that not much testing was done during this time yet the cases did not skyrocket in october or the following monthit‚Äôs common knowledge that nigerians travel a lot during the festive season but there‚Äôs not much data to support this assertionthe national association of nigeria travel agencies nanta announced that it recorded a  loss in  as  limited the number of people who could travel various countries suspended flights and nigeria banned interstate travel for some monthsthe major outlier in december was the nin registration the sudden increase in crowds preceded a surge in the final days of december  and it has not stopped since january it‚Äôs not just the nimc registration centres though government offices that need the nin connection complain of network issues leaving people to wait in their numbers also people trying to retrieve their lost sim cards complain about crowds and a complete disregard for social distancingthe nin exercise might be a turning point in nigeria‚Äôs history but at what cost will the spike in  numbers be worth it or should nigerians maintain their government distrust and disregard whatever  numbers the ncdc publishes or maybe there‚Äôs a false cause and this was always bound to happen
