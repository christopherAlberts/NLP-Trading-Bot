the us government has discovered the identity of satoshi nakamoto they label him as a terrorist they capture him and they ask him to help them control bitcoin nakamoto refuses so he’s waterboarded until he relents but unbeknownst to the government satoshi is playing his own long con… and is he even the real satoshi nakamotosuch is the premise of decrypted a british dark comedy that just finished production it sounds like a conventional thriller until you learn that satoshi is a gay masochist who gets off on the torture his girlfriend is trans and they argue with who writer mick sands describes as a “raging racist” as sands admits that “i’m definitely being provocative”with the possible exception of documentaries films about blockchain have been at best “mixed” no one seems to be clamoring for the return of kurt russell in crypto  crypto  factor authentication but one is bound to succeed at some point right crypto’s raw material is gold there’s plenty of money and there’s a builtin audience maybe decrypted will be the breakout at the time of publication press screeners were unavailablerelated how coinbase is worth  billionthen there’s the larger industry question for years many have looked to blockchain technology as a way to revolutionize the film industry just as they have looked for blockchain to revolutionize every industry from porn to the catholic church decrypted producer phil harris says this is now actually starting to happen which can help disrupt the “outdated bloated and often dishonest status quo”i spoke with writer mick sands and producer harris to learn more about the torture of satoshi nakamoto what it’s like to fundraise in crypto and how exactly blockchain could revolutionize the film industrysee also jeff wilser – bitcoin bull run ogs on why this one’s differentstory continuesnote mick sands was refreshingly – almost charmingly – indifferent to sharing massive spoilers of the movie’s plot including what appear to be its biggest twists so if you’re spoilerphobic proceed with cautionrelated kraken ceo says ether flash crash down to trading not system glitchcoindesk mick you made a bold choice in using satoshi nakamoto as your main character why’d you go that routemick sands i just thought it was more interesting to have him as the main guy and the fact that nobody knows who he is gave me a license to do whatever i want with him because actually it’s not him and of course the nsa doesn’t know what he looks like so if he could answer the right questions then they were going to buy itwait did you just drop a big spoiler are you saying that the main character of your film – satoshi nakamoto – is not actually satoshi nakamotoms it’s a surprise it’s a spoiler the nsa is planning to talk to satoshi to get a backdoor into the blockchain so they can control it unbeknownst to them the guy who’s posing as satoshi is planning to work them over to fk the nsainteresting what are you trying to say with this moviems with every film or script that i write there are at least two ideas that come together here there were three the first is the rise of fake truths and cancel culture and how everybody is shouting about their rights but without any real discussion whatever it was – homophobia gender identity racism sexism all those things had sort of been made illegal so nobody is allowed to discuss them anymorethat was the first thing then the other big idea was bitcoin and i was thinking about the blockchain and the idea that in a way it’s based on honesty and then the third one was finding out that according to the american government satoshi nakamoto is a terrorist he’s designated as a terrorist so i started to research what the cia or the nsa had been up to with regards to crypto and the nsa has been trying to find a way to control crypto since see also author ben mezrich on capturing the winklevii and plans for a ‘bitcoin billionaires’ moviehow do these themes tie together especially with crypto and satoshims so one of the nsa guys is a homophobe and a sexist his partner a woman is a feminist and satoshi’s girlfriend is transgender so i thought that if satoshi is her boyfriend then he’s got to be at least gay so he’s gay and then also the other idea – which i thought was funny at the start because i knew he was going to get waterboarded – is that he’s a masochist as well so he gets a little bit turned on by the stuff the homophobe beating him up and waterboarding himyou’re definitely leaning into some hot button issues…ms oh yeah yeah so i’m definitely being provocative but what i was careful to do so i don’t get hanged is that i’ve argued and given reasons for every different person there’s a guy who’s openhearted and believes that we should take all the borders down and satoshi and his girlfriend are cryptoanarchists so they have a point of view everybody gets to air their view which is really my point we should all try and be a bit more honest and listen to other peoplewhat do you want the cryptocommunity to take away from this filmms the guy who’s pretending to be satoshi and his girlfriend – they’re representatives of the crypto world and really they winanother spoilerms and so i hope the crypto community will think it’s fun and a positive endorsement of crypto partly because it’s based on honestyphil you’ve referred to a “blockchain revolution” in the film industry what’s the advantage exactly of blockchain in filmphil harris  it’s disrupting the current bloated often dishonest status quo of the film industry there’s a lot of transparency and efficiency with blockchain which is missing at the moment essentially with the sales agents and distributors they give you reports and it’s very difficult to know how accurate the numbers arehow soph when you’re a producer a sales agent will represent your film say to various distributors globally and you get a quarterly report of where it’s being sold how much money has been made on videoondemand platforms and so on but you have to accept their numbers unless you can afford an auditas a small independent company making lowbudget films an audit is expensive so you have to rely on what people are saying but with the blockchain obviously it’s transparent and you can collect revenue automatically in real time every time someone downloads the film it goes to all the relevant parties directly straight away everyone can see what’s going on so that in itself is a breath of fresh airthere’s been a lot of hype but what platforms that actually exist – and are up and running – do you see have real meritph so you’ve got videoondemand platform cinezen and movieschain and you’ve got companies like vuulr – they launched an ico years ago that i was interested in they provide a service on the blockchain where you can present your film directly to the buyers which might be a tv channel or a videoondemand platform without having to go through sales agents or distributorsbeyond the accuracy of reports what’s the problem with the current sales agent systemph i mean these sales markets are very outdated people used to take wheels of films around the world to these big markets and people would watch them in cinemas now you can just send links to screeners so vuulr cuts out the middleman you go direct to the buyers and then you can do contracts online and actually make a deal within a few days and then you’ve got filmchain which collects revenue and automatically distributes payments to all the participants invested in the filmyou mentioned the “middleman” – who are you talking about exactlyph the fat cats that have been in the industry for a very long time it’s the old system where they’d all meet up four times a year around the world and sell films to each other which you had to do physically they’re hanging on to that old modelit’s the people in the middle that seem to make an awful lot of money but we’re the ones putting in all the hard work and we’re the creatives so the same old story our profit margins are squeezed for the luxury of someone jetting around the world selling our filmwe really don’t need to do that now if i had access to all the buyers of the world and they had access to me we wouldn’t need the sales agents and the distributors and that is basically what vuulr and filmchain are doing so everyone invested in my film knows that each time a payment is made they would automatically directly get divided up and allocated to everybody contractedsee also mark cuban on bitcoin nfts and what comes next ‘the upside is truly unlimited’in theory this is all very cool but obviously it’s not yet super mainstream what do you think has held it back from broader adoption and what needs to happen for it to get more mainstreamph it’s a good question well first of all i think the only people interested in it are people who are interested in cryptocurrency so that does narrow it down but i think the more people get involved with crypto the more that’ll open up to a wider market and also filmchain and vuulr use blockchain technology but they don’t particularly use cryptocurrencies so they’ve blown into the wider marketsome of these videoondemand platforms use crypto payments and for them it’s only really people who love films and love crypto it’s early days but if crypto blows then i think these services will blow as well because it’s just another way that you’re paying for stuff using cryptoand you financed the film in crypto right how’d that workph we raised about threequarters of the funds in bitcoin we thought about launching an ico to raise funds but luckily i know a successful crypto trader and he loved the film idea he went to his crypto chums and they invested the money in bitcoin for our film so we didn’t actually have to launch an icothese are good chums and then what’d you do with the btcph we had to convert it to fiat to pay for everything it would be lovely in a future where people can accept cryptocurrency for services and it’d be great if we can pay content creators dividends in cryptocurrency but this is all stuff for the future when it becomes a little bit more widely used and when cryptocurrency as a whole expandsto the future best of luck with the filminterviews have been condensed and lightly edited for clarityrelated stories
