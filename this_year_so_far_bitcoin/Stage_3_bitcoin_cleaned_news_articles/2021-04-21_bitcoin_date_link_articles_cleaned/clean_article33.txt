i’ve been collecting coins since i was a kid but not so much in the sense of looking for and assembling coins that are worth more than their face value my coin collection what my spouse refers to as a “collection of coins” is more what happens when one empties one’s pockets of change accumulated each day through the normal course of purchasing morning tea paying for lunch stopping after work to pick up groceries that sort of thingi’ve been returning quarters nickels and dimes to circulation and now i’m finally dealing with pennies of which i estimate i have some tens of thousands mind you i don’t want to give them back to circulation without some inspection and possibly finding a noteworthy or valuable coin in essence turning my collection of coins into a coin collection so i look at each one before putting it in rolls to take to the bankthis process stands in contrast to my reading about money in the news the news today is about bitcoin cryptocurrency and a company called coinbase that recently went public and instantly acquired an estimated value of  billion that’s a lot of pennies it is so new my spellcheck wants to separate bitcoin into bit coin and cryptocurrency into crypto currencyanyway as i pour over my pennies one by one i confess to a complete lack of understanding of what this new thing “digital currency” is and how it works i suppose long ago people felt similarly about the invention of checks “what you’re giving me a piece of paper as payment you’ve got to be kidding” or further following the evolution of money and transactions “here’s my credit card this piece of plastic is my promise to pay”which brings us to now seeking to make checks a thing of the past if they aren’t more or less already and to remove the role of banks in transactions involving credit cards along comes digital currency somewhat awkwardly labeled cryptocurrency awkward because “crypto” is defined by merriam webster’s dictionary as secret and sounds a bit nefariousanyway the point i’m getting to is that i don’t really understand digital currency this may be an evolution of money that in time becomes as familiar as checks and credit cards but as of now i’m pretty sure no one is using it to buy a cup of coffeewhat caught my notice was a few articles about how much energy is required to run this new digital currency estimates are all over the map and here are a couple of examples of that prepare yourself for a few words and terms that are very new at least to mea new york times article explains how it works “cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology which relies on specialized computers racing to solve complex equations making quintillions of attempts a second to verify transactions it’s that practice called cryptomining that makes the currencies so energyintensive”this process relies on a concept called “proof of work” a “computing method that’s intentionally designed to be inefficient to keep currencies transparent and decentralized” proof of work “forces miners to compete to solve cryptographic puzzles in an intense race of trial and error their computers together making more than  quintillion attempts a second to produce a new block this competition keeps immense numbers of computers working at top speed around the clock and all over the world”just to review a quintillion is a number followed by  zeroes it can also be expressed as “a million trillion” or a “billion billion”according to the new york times “researchers at cambridge university estimate that bitcoin the most popular blockchainbased currency uses more electricity than entire countries like argentina do” while this estimate has been challenged no one disagrees that the computers require enormous amounts of electricity the website digiconomist estimates that “each bitcoin transaction requires tens of thousands of times more electricity to process than each visa credit card transaction”the article also cites but does not identify a new study in which researchers “warned that if left unchecked bitcoin mining in china — where an estimated twothirds of the world’s blockchain mining takes place — could make it difficult for the world’s largest polluter to meet its climate goals” and that china’s inner mongolia region is moving to ban cryptomining “because it was hampering the province’s efforts to meet new carbonemission targets set by the national government”in all estimates the energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions are a lot but there’s another reason i’m not yet a bitcoin person there’s a guy in san francisco who bought  bitcoins back in  and wrote the password to his bitcoin wallet on a piece of paper he can no longer find he gets  tries and has used eight with no luck two more and the password is wiped away forever and he loses an estimated  millioni’ll bet my penny jar looks pretty good to him right about now and i’ll stick with my bank and their system of “did you lose or forget your password”— john mottsmith is a resident of davis this column appears the first and third wednesday of each month in the print edition of the davis enterprise please send comments to
