below is the definition of the consumer price index cpi by the us bureau of labor statistics“the cpi represents changes in prices of all goods and services purchased for consumption by urban households user fees such as water and sewer service and sales and excise taxes paid by the consumer are also included income taxes and investment items like stocks bonds and life insurance are not included”  us bureau of labor statisticshowever the definition was different  years ago shadowstats goes into more depth here current cpi is simply based on a basket of goods as defined by the bls it does not directly reflect inflation because there are many other assets that hold the money supply so the basket of goods on which the cpi is based seems to be a bit arbitrary to explore this we will examine the old ways in which cpi was calculated before shadowstats  inflationin  cnbc published an article on the shadowstats website and how its inflation calculation is much different than that of the current cpi postgreat recession according to shadowstats inflation is much closer to  based on the methods by which the bureau of labor statistics used to calculate it back in image via shadowstatscomthis is much higher than the – goal of the us federal reserve fed and it begs the question of whether the dollar although it has been the strongest currency for the past century or more may not be as strong as the fed leads us to believeasset inflation and the democratization of technologythe cpi doesnt include housing or other assets we use to store our wealth this is important because goods are not the only place people put their money instead many people use stocks real estate gold and other financial instruments as forms of savings sometimes because they have no choice and are forced into highergrowth assetsthe official inflation figure based on cpi was  in  but the average us housing price increased by  and stocks as measured by the sp  increased by  some of these assets have risen in price despite the economy being ravaged by shutdowns and economic restrictions in response to this the us government decided to mint checks and send them to people in need but the majority of americans received checks despite still being employed this excess money flooded into bitcoin stocks and real estatewhen people take their freshly minted dollars and throw them into stocks to maintain their wealth the stocks’ valuations do not grow because the stocks are good it simply expands the overall market by the amount of new dollars this is known as asset inflation if assets grew in value with no change in the money supply that would be a different story but that is not the casethe figure below shows how the prices of us consumer goods have changed over the years the dispersion of prices can be related to a number of different factors but we can simplify one of them by better understanding democratization the cantillon effect explains how monetary inflation affects certain baskets of itemsimage via httpswwwcommodityresearchgroupcomalookatinflationcarpediemthe reason why many items ie those that are below the inflation line have become more affordable is because technology is inherently deflationary this is otherwise known as democratization of technology the definition states that production of a technology gets cheaper as more of it is produced for example even though manufacturers are getting better at making televisions and cellphones the money supply is still inflating therefore the inflation of the money supply is offset dramatically by the deflationary nature of production and technological innovation this may even be one of the fundamental truths of capitalism competition drives innovation and the prices of goods fall over timemonetary

large portions of the economy you might ask a few questions to find out why this may be the case money is the output of energy saved into a transferable instrument and people are looking for the

bitcoin is that the supply of bitcoin can be easily and automatically audited historically the fed has refused to be audited bitcoin is not only extremely verifiable with a transparent blockchain but it is audited every  minutes with each block everyone has the same copy of the network and it is being audited every hour of every day  daysyear foreverbitcoin is the most scarce verifiable and
