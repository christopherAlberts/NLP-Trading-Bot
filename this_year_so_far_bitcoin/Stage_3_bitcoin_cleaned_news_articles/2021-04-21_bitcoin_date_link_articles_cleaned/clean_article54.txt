at around  on march   something extraordinary happened to the price of bitcoinafter tanking more than  per cent the previous day it rallied from below  to over  in less than an hour now over a year on from bitcoin’s flash corona crash its price is sitting above investors who were brave enough to buy the march  bitcoin dip have done rather well for themselves but for the rest of us that opportunity is long gone with bitcoin having already done a “ bagger” in just over a year the question remains is now a good time to get inyou could make the argument that bitcoin is a finite digital commodity—hence its price should continue to rise versus nonfinite fiat currencies over time then again bitcoin has already gone up by so much so it could be due a sizable correction before that happensin truth it is impossible to predict what bitcoin will do next it does what it likes when it likes this makes timing the market extremely difficult to do with that said there are a few simple techniques to potentially reduce the risk of buying bitcoin – or indeed other volatile cryptocurrencies that are potentially on one’s radardon’t put all your eggs in the bitcoin basketbitcoin’s average price appreciation has been about  per cent per year since  but during that time it has had six drawdowns that were greater than  per cent in other words holders who were all in on bitcoin would have seen their portfolios halve in value several times while on the path the crypto riches for these investors to recover from a  per cent drawdown bitcoin had to double in valuethis problem becomes exponentially worse as losses grow larger consider the bear market of  for example where bitcoin shed  per cent of its dollar value here bitcoin had to go up more than six times to recover from this loss – that took about three yearsvery few investors have the fortitude to patiently weather these types of price declines and many capitulate and sell at a loss right before the bottom it is human nature to let our emotions get the better of us when investing yet despite our best efforts it is almost impossible to overcome thema far easier way to not be driven by our emotions is to build investment portfolios that are less likely to take massive losses in the first place this is where diversification comes to our aid investors who had allocated between one and five per cent of their portfolios to bitcoin since  would have still achieved exceptional returnsrebalancing is keydiversification usually works wonders to offset risk but with an asset like bitcoin which has racked up astonishing gains in comparison to other investments portfolio rebalancing is also crucial for reducing volatilityconsider an investor who assigned just one per cent of a portfolio to bitcoin in  with the rest in the sp  us stocks index by the end of  that portfolio would have comprised more than  per cent in bitcoin and less than  per cent in the sp  as bitcoin’s price increased relative to us stocks the investor became overly exposed to bitcoin’s volatilityhowever by rebalancing once per quarter for example the investor would have reset the portfolio’s bitcoin exposure back to one per cent at regular intervals this would have resulted in the investor buying bitcoin when it underperformed us stocks and selling bitcoin when it outperformed us stocks put another way the investor would have been impelled to buy bitcoin low and sell it highoverall the rebalanced portfolio would have beaten the sp  without increasing the size of its largest drawdown this would also have been the case with an up to five per cent bitcoin allocationinvest small sums often rather than a large sum all at oncethe biggest fear most people have about buying bitcoin is that they buy it at the top – right before a major crash – and lose a substantial portion of their initial investment yet by investing small amounts each month the potential for this to happen quickly falls awaypound cost averaging is an everpopular strategy for gradually building up exposure to bitcoin by investing the same number of pounds each month investors can buy bitcoin over a range of prices when prices are low they buy more bitcoin with the same number of pounds when prices are high they buy relatively fewer bitcoin this can help them get in at good average prices over timevalue averaging is a more aggressive accumulation strategy than pound cost averaging here an investor would choose a “value path” that determines the gbp amount of bitcoin to hold at the end of each month the investor would then buy more or less bitcoin each month depending on how close the gbp value is to that value path this implies larger investments in months when bitcoin is cheap and smaller investments in months when it is more expensivein months where the gbp value of bitcoin is in surplus to the value path the investor would sell bitcoin to get back to it since there is planned selling involved value averaging offers a middle ground between shorterterm trading and longterm investing this strategy may suit those wishing to accumulate bitcoin over a certain time frame but also take profits along the way if prices get too highof course selling bitcoin in a strong bull run may lead to lower returns in the long run be that as it may nobody ever became poor by taking profits – especially if those proceeds are invested in other assets different investments go up over time but they don’t all go up at the same timeeach to their ownultimately each investor will have their own tolerance for taking risks higher risks can lead to higher returns over time but also more downside in the short term those who like and can afford to take more risk would be comfortable allocating more of their investable wealth to bitcoin and other digital assets but regardless of one’s proclivity for risk having a longterm view is usually best when it comes to bitcoindisclaimer nothing in this article should be considered investment
