coindesk director of research noelle acheson joined yahoo finsance live to break down the state of cryptovideo transcriptadam shapiro some people are investing their money in cryptocurrency especially bitcoin about  right now for a coin lets talk about whats going on in the broader crypto market and were going to help or at least get some help to do that from noelle acheson coin desk director of researchits good to have you here also the author of the crypto long and short newsletter and the reason we invited you into the stream is we get all of these predictions i mean the latest is get ready for a  pullback which seems a bit extreme but weve seen things like that before so what should we as perhaps crypto investors be paying attention tonoelle acheson hi adam thank you very much for having me its a pleasure to be here with you and yes we have seen moves like that before bitcoin is volatile and at some stage it will have a correction although id personally be very surprised to see that steep fall when sentiment is still bullish when institutions are still leaning into investment as well as growing out crypto services when mainstream interest is really mainstream investors are coming in by hordes and onramps are rolling out for them almost every month when we also have regulatory tailwinds at the industrys backhistorically bitcoin has moved in fouryear cycles this is an important detail to bear in mind and were two years into this one could it be cut short yes maybe but thats extremely unlikely and we also have to bear in mind that it has a lot to do with whats going on in the broader markets as wellwhile bitcoin is presented as sort of the antidote to traditional markets and traditional assets it is going to move inline we saw this last march when everything went south bitcoin went south as well and sentiment out there may be jittery but again we cant really say that it has turned bearish just yetstory continuesseana smith noelle you mentioned the fact that theres more institutional investors coming in and weve covered that time and time again here at yahoo finance but how do you see that affecting or do you see it affecting the volatility at all is it going to help stabilize thingsnoelle acheson volatility right now is a lot lower than it was at the beginning of the year its a lot lower than it was at the end of january almost half what it was volatility has been trending down over time as more liquidity comes into the industry as the capital markets infrastructure becomes more sophisticated as there are more derivatives with which to hedge positions as well as take some directionsand well it will always be a lot more volatile than some of the traditional assets that we know because of the lack of what traditional investors call fundamentals because it is very narrative driven as well and because it tends to move on sentiment it will always be a lot more volatile but that volatility is trending downadam shapiro when we read notes from different analysts that point out bitcoin up about  year to date it was over  but then they say if it doesnt break  again soon the momentum to go higher is gone those of us who arent crypto investors but want to get in on this how do we make heads or tails of itnoelle acheson adam im actually i confess im kind of with you on that the psychological barriers and directions that the technical analysts talk about i listen i understand that psychology is very important  a nice round number but the trends and the support and the tailwinds i confess i dont understand them either theres so many variables in play at the moment in the crypto industryit is not a market that is exclusively driven by technical analysis as much as that may work in other markets because it is so young it is changing it is not just a new type of asset its a new type of technology and this is something that many of us tend to overlook at timesseana smith noelle we saw bitcoin hit an alltime high earlier this week since then its pulled back just a bit its off another  right now when you take a look at dogecoin does it have a purpose do you thinknoelle acheson no it doesnt the fascinating thing about dogecoin is that it has done so well it has lasted so long and it has such a loyal following without a clear purpose and what it is doing and this is really fascinating is calling into question our understanding of valueit doesnt really have a purpose even its founders disavowed the project a very long time ago but there it is there are many that believe it has value therefore it has value calling into question our longstanding assumptions how markets should move is i think dogecoins use case reallyadam shapiro ok so we all know the childhood story goldilocks the three bears too hot too cold just right is ether i mean ether is what around  at this point does that make more sense for the investor who might want to start putting their toes i mean thats still a lot of money but its not  grand and its not dogecoin eithernoelle acheson thats very true one thing that many people misunderstand about bitcoin for instance is that you dont have to buy a whole bitcoin yes it may be well over  you dont have to spend a minimum of  to get involved you can spend a fraction of that ether is a very different investment propositionit is riskier its volatility is much higher its returns are much higher too as one would expect from a riskier asset if moving in the right direction but while bitcoin is seen largely by investors today as a store of value first ether is more the technology play ether is undergoing a very radical experimental transformation of its underlying consensus algorithm its very excitinghow often do we get to see this kind of transformation happening in real time in an asset that actually already has a very liquid market its something that weve never been able to witness before and the potential of ether to transform how finance works how value is shared and even how identity and many other aspects of our society function is interestingits really fascinating its risky because it is so new so is ether a better bet than bitcoin it entirely depends on whether youre going to choose a store value proposition or whether you are more interested in getting in early on a liquid technology play i should caveat that nothing i say is investment advice and my opinions are mine not those of my employeradam shapiro yeah i totally understand that and perhaps next time you come on we can talk about one way to minimize that risk perhaps using that newly launched ether etf but we have to say thank you right now noelle acheson coindesks director of research good to have you here we look forward to you returning
