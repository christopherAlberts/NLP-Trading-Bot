well yes of course an antimoney laundering and identity verification expert say proactive firms have been working on this for yearsthere’s spurious proof if any that last weekend’s bitcoin flash crash was linked to impending antimoney laundering action from federal regulatorsthe prevailing opinion explained by longtime onchain analyst willy woo is that a blackout in the xinjiang region of china triggered an unexpected dip in hash rates and spooked a lot of people into sellingeven so it seemed a good time to check in with antimoney laundering and identity verification experts after all it’s what blockchain association executive director kristin smith said she expects to be first up in dctheres already a federal case in motion in new york that could act as a bell weather for how regulation will be shaped in the usarthur hayes the former ceo of crypto exchange bitmex surrendered to authorities in hawaii last week he and three other former bitmex execs have been charged with failing to implement adequate antimoney laundering controlshe pleaded not guilty and was released on a  million bond pending federal court proceedings in new yorkthe grand jury indictment alleges that hayes had knowledge of hackers using bitmex to launder stolen cryptocurrency and permitted residents of iran the subject of us sanctions to create accountsbut any firm thats waited until now to start figuring out how guard against moneylaundering comply with sanctions and implement know your customer identity checks has left themselves open to unwelcome attentions from the fedscrypto investor spoke with pekka dare vice president of the international compliance association ica and yuelin li vice president of strategy at onfido they both said theres been an uptick in inbound requests for training solutions or insight into how regulators will proceeddare said crypto firms that have already done their compliance homework stand to benefit when seeking to partner with traditional banking institutions“if you can demonstrate youve got good aml controls and systems that will open up more commercial opportunities for you so it could be a win for the industry to be seen as having robust aml because we dont want to see it go too far and throw the baby out with the bathwater right and kill the whole business model of these crypto companies and put people off anyone from investing he said it’s about finding that sweet spot”the ica is the organization that trains compliance officers on how to train employees at financial institutions dare said theres been as much interest from officers at fiat firms as there has from ones that handle cryptoaml in particular has become much more of a focus globally in the last couple years weve seen these huge global scandals with just mindboggling amounts of money moving around the world linked to drug cartels dare saidhe advises keeping an eye on the financial action task force which recently published draft guidance on digital assetsmeanwhile li said the londonbased identity verification service provider counts bitex local bitcoins coindcx and bitpay among their clients she’s quick to point out that the firms she interacts with skew heavily towards being proactive about compliance concernsbroadly speaking there are two pieces that a firm needs to have in place to verify a customers identity a system to prompt users documents which varies from one jurisdiction to the next and a way to verify that those documents are legitimatethere are documents that dont have great quality pictures or places where you can acquire documents much more easily li said so there is a vulnerability to that seeing a number of fraudulent documents or impersonation attacksher advice to the crypto firms that aren’t thinking about aml yet is to learn from fintech“if the sec wants to go to them and say ‘i want to understand your process how you’re doing identity verification monitoring and antimoney laundering’ it’s in their best interest to run a really good business to already have that in place precrypto we saw this with fintech i remember five years ago it was ‘will fintech take over banking or is banking going to crush fintech li said and what we’ve wound up with on the whole is a lot more innovation than we would have otherwise seen in traditional banking so if crypto wants to participate in the economy and regulatory framework there’s lots of opportunity”
