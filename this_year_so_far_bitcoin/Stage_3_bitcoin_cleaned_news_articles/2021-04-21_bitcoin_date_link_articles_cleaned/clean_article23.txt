galaxy digital is also among the many organizations that has also applied for a bitcoin exchangetraded fund in the united statesin the leadup to the launch both ci global and evolve were the most aggressive by waiving all fees for their ethereum etfs in a bid to capture the majority of the market sharethough the us securities and exchange commission sec has rejected all attempts to launch a bitcoin etf in the united states since  the crypto community and mainstream investors looking for exposure in the nascent market are eagerly awaiting the regulator’s decision on the application from mutual fund manager vaneck which was filed in december  vaneck’s application has been under review for weeks and the sec is expected to make a decision on april in an interview with forkastnews elliot johnson cio and coo of evolve funds said that the progressive attitude and “practical approach” of the ontario securities commission osc to collaborate with fund issuers appear to be the main reasons why canada now has four operating bitcoin etfs and were able to launch the three new ethereum etfs so quickly while the us is still awaiting a decision on their own crypto etf proposalsthe osc takes the stance of “how can we make it safe for investors to use” rather than view the etf proposals as a threat they don’t understand johnson said “they don’t really feel threatened they think about providing a good progressive flexible regulatory scheme which allows them to maintain a stable financial system that’s relevant for the future as well”unlike the sec which often requires all communication through legal and formal correspondence johnson said “we were able to have discussions with the regulators about their concerns without having to do it through filings in the public domain that usually causes everything to look like an argument in the newspapers”instead johnson added “there is a process for being collaborative that exists for canadian issuers with the canadian regulators and that is an amazing thing to be able to put some context around what they  wanted in practical terms”in an interview with forkastnews alex tapscott managing director of digital asset group at ninepoint partners said the us regulatory climate toward bitcoin etfs could be changing with a crypto expert now in charge of the sec“gary gensler who was biden’s nominee for chairperson of the sec was confirmed by the senate” tapscott said “he has a pretty full plate of different kinds of priorities i’m not sure how highly a bitcoinetf approval ranks on his list of priorities but he is someone who knows the technology””frankly an etf approval in the us is an inevitability” tapscott said “it’s not a question of if it’s a question of when” is china warming to bitcoinpboc may be warming up to crypto image  cc bysa  via wikimedia commonsin surprise public statements a chinese central bank official — appearing to adopt a new softer stance toward cryptocurrency — said over the weekend that bitcoin and other crypto assets should be regulated as “alternative investments”“we believe bitcoin and stablecoins are crypto assets that should be regarded as investment vehicles not currencies” said li bo deputy governor of the people’s bank of china pboc in a panel discussion at boao forum the “asian davos” that takes place in boao in hainan province every yearli said pboc is still working on the regulations for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and mentioned if stablecoins want to be widely used payment tools they will be subject to even stronger regulations in chinali also mentioned china’s digital yuan saying dcep does not aim to replace the us dollar or any other international currency zhou xiaochuan the former president of pboc added that the initial purpose of dcep is to create a more convenient payment system for the domestic retailing marketforkastinsights  what does it meanthe comments made by li bo the deputy governor of people’s bank of china during the “digital payment and digital currency” panel discussion of the boao forum for asia annual conference  on sunday may indicate a realization by china’s officials that decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin can’t be stopped and regulation is a more appropriate response than an outright banwu blockchain a chinabased crypto blogger said that beijing may have some positive policy changes coming for cryptocurrency based on pboc’s words at the boao forum as “it was the first time pboc’s deputy governor has positively acknowledged the significance of bitcoin and other cryptoassets in a direct way as investment vehicles and emphasized compliance of regulation”in many parts of asia particularly india there appears to be a concerted effort by the government to legitimize cryptocurrencies as banning them has proved futile in the past in an interview with forkastnews jeremy britton cfo of bostoncoin said “india putting a crypto ban is not going to make people stop using crypto it’s just going to make people use crypto illegally that’s going to make people distrust the government and they know the entire world is using this  it’s not going to stop people doing it in fact it’ll have the opposite effect”due to crypto’s surging popularity both in india and asia britton said “the government is fighting a losing battle and they will look very very silly trying to ban crypto whereas other countries such as china tried to ban crypto in  they let it go then they banned it again and let it go and banned it again”as has been felt by investors in india regarding new cryptocurrency disclosure legislation china’s own crypto communities see the pboc’s comments on crypto regulation as an encouraging step by the government one netizen commented on weibo “it is better that pboc plans to regulate cryptocurrencies rather than ban it all” another netizen said “regulation on cryptocurrency means cryptocurrency is going to have legitimacy”encouraging as it may sound it should be noted that li bo’s comments are the only indication that crypto regulation could be coming soon and there has been no official announcement from the pboc although it is unlikely that the governor spoke out of turn particularly after the consequences felt by alibaba founder jack ma who “disappeared” for several months after he was openly critical of china’s regulatory regime and attitude towards innovation last october
