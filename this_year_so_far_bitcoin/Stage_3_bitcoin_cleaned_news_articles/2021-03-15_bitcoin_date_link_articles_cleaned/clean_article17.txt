btc miner stresses bitcoin is one of the most environmentfriendly financial networkswhile bitcoin has been gathering widespread attention with prices touching alltime highs mainstream pundits have tried to attack the leading crypto asset for its energy consumption it seems a new ‘bitcoin is bad for the environment’ editorial is published nearly every week by mainstream journalists tech authors and climate activists this week a representative from the crypto company and dedicated mining operation bixen explained that it is wrong to assume that bitcoin mining is unsustainable to the global environmentclimate activists love to attack bitcoin with washed up energy arguments from three years agoever since bitcoin btc and a number of other digital assets touched fresh new price highs the crypto assets have seen mainstream attention moreover a lot of journalists and popular pundits have focused on the energy consumption the bitcoin network leverages this has been happening every week since btc prices have grown hot and it happened a lot in  as wellfor instance on march  the climate activist clean tech author and analyst ketan joshi wrote an editorial that is no different than the slew of unresearched attacks against the bitcoin network’s electricity consumption“bitcoin has three problems energy hunger fossil industry partnerships and classic libertarian loathing of renewables and climate action” joshi tweeted to his  twitter followers “combined they mean bitcoin is a mouth hungry for fossil fuels” he added of course the editorial barely touched upon renewable energy resources used by a great number of bitcoin miners and attacked fossil fuel firms for something they already do anyway flare excess natural gaschinese bitcoin miner sets the record straight renewables are king in the bitcoin mining realmmustafa yilham a representative for bixen a cryptocurrency firm that participates in mining bitcoin has recently explained how many of these ‘bitcoin is bad for the environment’ pundits are wrongyilham can actually speak on the matter with expertise rather than critics like ketan joshi and the myriad of mainstream commentators who spend very little time researching this subject bixen’s mining operation commands roughly  of the entire btc hashrate which is around  exahash per second on monday march “we always hear  argument  bitcoin consumes more energy than xyz therefore it’s inefficient” yilham tweeted “you have to look at two things in this argument what type of energy does bitcoin consume where would that energy go without bitcoin” as a miner bixen’s primary goal is “to use cheapest electricity rate available”this happens to be renewable energy sources like hydropower and flare gas from excess waste yilham explained that in china where a large portion of the global btc hashrate resides “miners migrate to different regions based on season”“during summer mining operations are mostly based in sichuan  during winter it’s primarily based in xinjianginner mongolia” yilham stressed “during  rainy season sichuan produces excessive hydropower keywords excessive  hydro the problem is winter there is not enough rain so miners need to move to other regions such as xinjiang  inner mongolia and these regions are currently producing more than  of their electricity through thermal energy aka…burning coal” yilham addeddespite the move to a region that burns coal yilham highlights that things are changing rapidly“in   of the energy on xinjiang electricity grid was renewable and  expects to further increase  in coming years” yilham said “during winter miners purchase electricity through  grid like other industries and we don’t get to  what type of energy goes on  grid that’s a policy decision we try our best to  locations with more renewable energy and intentionally or not that is happening” he saidcan traditional finance networks migrate toward renewables seasonallythe bixen representative also emphasized that btc mining only accounts for around  of the electricity used in areas like xinjiang and inner mongolia during winter “xinjiang has a massive energy production and expects to further support over  other states in china” yilham said“since we are using  grid here is a really important question without bitcoin mining would it decrease  region’s energy production capacity the answer is most likely no the excessive energy would simply get transferred to other states or businesses we have that infrastructure” the bixen representative addedyilham continuedbitcoin is probably one of the most environmentallyfriendly financial ‘industries’ because we can migrate during seasons and maintain  renewable during summer and over  renewable during winter renewable rates will further increase soon can visa do thatyilham’s testament to what’s really happening in places like china where bitcoin mining is concentrated shows that btc mining is far more energyefficient than traditional payment rails moreover the crypto asset is voluntary by nature and pundits should really consider the cost of the military backing used to sustain the united states dollaryilham adds that his perspective stems from “situations in china” “other regions such as siberia iceland sweden are probably close to  renewable” he added “and i didn’t even mention how bitcoin mining is helping to resolve flare gas issues” climate activists and members of the ‘bitcoin is bad for the environment’ camp never explain what should be done with gas flaringbecause a number of miners leverage gas flare to mine it helps reduce the  of manmade atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions globally reducing is far better than adding to it in the eyes of many bitcoin proponents who understand that the energy complaints are full of hot airwhat do you
