cryptocurrency we thought you might like a bit of an overview like the offtherails gamestop stock hack the cryptocurrency dogecoin has been on a bit of an undeserved roll and because whats a fake currency without a bonkers billionaire much of dogecoins recent moment and that of bitcoin too can be attributed to elon musk and his fondness for tweetingin this article well take a quick look at the  cryptocurrencies we find most interesting if you havent heard of many of them youre not alone there are of course a whole lot more than twelve cryptocurrencies out there some of these are well lets just say that if you read the whole article youll find a currency based on the market value of weed need i say morewhat are cryptocurrencieszdnet recommends bitcoin mining  how to build a cryptomining rig interested in building a system for mining cryptocurrency heres all the hardware you need and what you need to know to get started read morewhen bitcoin and the blockchain concept exploded onto the internet in  it took the speculative world by storm it offered a way to transact money protect identity and move value across the world virtually instantaneously and free from government banking and central oversightthis freedom provided great value to many different types of individuals and organizations ranging from activists stuck in repressive countries to organized crime organizations hiding transactions to individuals and massive corporations interested in exploring a new data management paradigmtoday there are thousands of different cryptocurrencies some are mere forks of the original bitcoin concept while many others have been coded from the ground up most leverage the architectural benefits of the blockchain concept which allows transactions to be added to a central yet distributed data storebitcoins blockchain is particularly interesting because while the identity of each person conducting transactions can be hidden every single transaction ever conducted in bitcoin is available for anyone to review and analyzebitcoin also introduced the concept of coin mining the practice of using computer hardware to solve challenging problems as a way of creating new digital coins mining exploded over the past few years transforming from a program running on a spare pc to giant mining complexes built into the sides of mountains in frigid climates in order to control the heat generated by mining computersits important to note i am not recommending any of these cryptocurrencies investing in cryptocurrencies is speculative at best their values can fluctuate wildly their underlying management is often unknown and the question of how governments will react and regulate is always top of mindthat said cryptocurrencies are fascinating and its possible youll transact business using one or another at some point in the near future its almost guaranteed that youll transact business using blockchain technology whether because youre specifically using a cryptocurrency or because one of the businesses you encounter has adopted it as an underlying technologywith that we present a dozen fascinating cryptocurrencies starting with the one that started it all bitcoinbitcoin btcmarket capmax supply  btccirculating supply  btcmineable yesbitcoin is the famous cryptocurrency that set off the entire digital gold rush launched on the internet in  by a mysterious figure calling himself satoshi nakamoto the bitcoin code introduced blockchain technology and solved many challenging technical problems about transaction securitybitcoin kicked off a rush of investment jumping in value from  per bitcoin to more than  in midmarch you can even buy a tesla with bitcoinunfortunately bitcoin also set off a race for socalled mining of the digital coins the core bitcoin algorithm requires more and more resources for each coin mined as a way to add friction into the production of the currency the inevitable sideeffect of that design is an everincreasing energy footprintscientists estimate that worldwide bitcoin mining consumes somewhere between  megawatts and  gigawatts or more than enough to keep an entire coalpowered electrical plant busy a typical electrical plant generates about  megawatts some writers have even postulated that bitcoins mining operations will consume the worlds entire energy supply this is unrealistic for many reasons but theres no doubt bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are consuming energy at a disturbing paceall this is to say that the days of running bitcoin mining software on a spare pc are long gone todays bitcoin miners are so sophisticated theyre building mining operations in very cold countries like iceland where the cooling costs for all those computers can be offset by the naturally cold conditionsbecause bitcoin was the first major cryptocurrency some inherent limitations have become apparent over time including the cost and time of mining a single coin and the limits to its scalability to improve upon the original bitcoin there is a whole slew of alternative currenciesone such is bitcoin cash which is considered a hard fork from the original bitcoin code it uses a different verification mechanism and a larger block size there are also bitcoin gold bitcoin dark bitcoin plus bitcoinz bitcoin scrypt and bitcoin red if youre looking for the original bitcoin verify that it is the currency trading as btclitecoin ltcmarket capmax supply  ltccirculating supply  ltcmineable yeslitecoin is the lessfilling alt currency litecoin is one of the most popular bitcoinalternative currencies out there with a market capitalization well into the billions of dollarsits important to understand that at its core each cryptocurrency is essentially a software application therefore the underlying code of the application greatly impacts the behavior of transactions in the currencylitecoins primary claims to fame revolve around three key elements first it is apicompatible with bitcoin so all software that talks to bitcoin can theoretically talk to litecoin second blockchain updates the actual transaction processing itself are substantially faster leading to quicker transaction confirmations finally litecoin was founded by a former google engineer who now works at coinbase a leading currency exchange this means that access to litecoin through coinbase may be more efficientlitecoin can be mined but instead of using the  algorithm it uses scrypt this algorithm is far more memoryintensive than computeintensive so the custom asic chips that have been developed to mine bitcoin arent suited for litecoin the prevailing premise is that this reduces the socalled arms race in mining technology thats caused such a frenzy in the bitcoin worldethereum ethmarket capcirculating supply  ethmineable yesethereum which originated in russia takes the currencyassoftware concept even further ethereum is considered an application platform rather than merely a digital analog of money this will undoubtedly give you a headache but its worth paying some attentionthe underlying architecture of ethereum was designed to decentralize computing processes to take the storage resources of cloud apps out of a single entitys hands like google or aws and to distribute the storage resources across the entire internet if this seems to you to have the flavor of the old peertopeer music sharing services you arent wrongsince these resources even if theyre on individuals computers arent free theyre paid for by a currency called ether ether is the actual cryptocurrency while ethereum is the platform the idea is for web apps to be built on top of ethereum and for ether to pay for their useone very interesting aspect of this idea of currencyasplatform is that you can add intelligence to transactions this opens the door to smart contracts which are contracts built into the dna of software rather than negotiated by lawyers once a certain condition is met the currency itself can decide to spit out paymentsroyalties are a good example a smart contract can be built into a royalty currency app that decides that once a month a certain amount of ether would be distributed based on some preprogrammed criteriaether can be mined essentially by providing the resources for the ethereum platform there is no topend circulating supply of ethereum so inflation is definitely possibleit should be noted that you might run into something called etc which is ethereum classic this uses the socalled original ethereum blockchain but is subject to considerable controversy if youre trading in ethereum do so in eth not etc unless you are very very sure you know what youre doingripple xrpmarket capmax supply  xrpcirculating supply  xrpmineable noripple is another very popular cryptocurrency with an overall market value of over  billion at the time of this writingwhat makes ripple different from most of the other cryptocurrencies profiled in this directory is that ripple is built entirely around the centralized control of one company ripple labs inc the company which has deep ties to the banking industry controls nearly  percent of the overall supply of xrp the ripple currency xrp cant be minedthis means that the company can either keep or dump that supply which could result in possibly problematic companyinitiated selloffs and value fluctuations outside of the influence of the market as a wholewhat makes ripple interesting is that its a blockchain technology being adopted by some very bluechip banking companies including bank of america and ubs this technology is being used to fuelsecure international transactions with relatively high speed and low transaction fees making it interesting to those who are looking at new generations of banking and transaction technologyzcash zecmarket capcirculating supply  zecmineable yeswhile most cryptocurrencies support anonymous trading there are limits to the privacy afforded in bitcoins case for example while the owner of a given wallets identity can be kept private all the transactions associated with a given bitcoin wallet are actually a matter of very public record if you can be connected to a given bitcoin identifier all your transactions can be traced through your entire transaction historythis has been a concern for privacy advocates and has given rise to what is considered private currencies these are essentially blockchainbased currencies where the identity information of both the sender and recipients can be concealed through zeroknowledge cryptographic securityzcash implements zeroknowledge in its blockchain algorithm while it competes with other private currencies none other than the nsarecords fugitive edward snowden has declared zcashs privacy tech makes it the most interesting bitcoin alternative bitcoin is great but if its not private its not safezcash also protects transactions through a blockchain mechanism that is almost the polar opposite of bitcoins while bitcoins proof of security is the availability of every transaction in history for verification zcash does not link older transactions to currently trading coins it is a

was originally launched as xcoin xco its developers then changed its name to darkcoin and then finally they settled on dashdash is a fork of the litecoin code but provides nearly instantaneous transaction speeds and private money transfers unlike bitcoin and litecoin the blockchain of dash is tiered one tier the one used for block creation is utilized by currency miners the second tier the masternodes tier is used to perform transfer and governance functionsdash the organization behind the currency fashions itself to be a decentralized autonomous organization or dao what this means is that its governance is not conducted by a human board of directors but rather is encoded in a series of smart contracts embedded in its own software programmasternodes become masternodes when theyre loaded with  dash or  at todays trading rate  roughly  in other words if you didnt start with a pile of dash and want to be part of the daos governance youll need to have nearly a quartermillion bucks in dash equivalentdogecoin dogemarket capcirculating supply  dogemineable yesweve managed to go almost  words without coming back to elon musk youre welcome musk it seems has been tweeting about dogecoin it started with thisthe future currency of earth — elon musk elonmusk february  and hes gone on to tweet more about it apparently there was some discussion about an sec investigation of that tweet in which musk responded it would be awesome so theres that seriously you can not make this stuff up hes like what would happen if you merged the psyches of bruce wayne and the joker into one hightech executive and of course space karenbut i digress theres dogecoin which is itself quite the storywhen a currency is based on the image of a shiba inu dog derived from a reddit joke which in turn was based on strong bads nickname doge in the homestar runner animated cartoon series you might not be inclined to take it seriously but somehow despite its odd origins dogecoin has a market cap north of  billion with a b and therefore is worthy of attentionits a very odd currency with a very dedicated fan base although it experienced a serious hack in  resulting in the theft of coins members of the dogecoin community jumped in and covered the losses of those affecteddogecoin has been used over the years to collect donations for the olympics to sponsor a nascar driver and to build a well in kenya its also become very popular in certain online circles as a way to send tips to content producers and gamersmonero xmrmarket capcirculating supply  xmrmineable yesmonero takes the privacy concept promoted by zcash and ups it a notch zcash allows transactions to be triggered as anonymous but thats not the default behavior by contrast all of moneros transactions start anonymous by defaultthe currency uses a number of mechanisms to preserve the anonymity of the transacting parties as well as of individual coins themselves this is in strong contrast to bitcoin which allows individual coins to be identified as part of given transactions with bitcoin it is possible therefore to trace which coins were involved in criminal behavior possibly tainting those coins for future trading or subjecting those coins to blacklisting from vendors and exchangesby contrast monero mixes various keys and identities so its not possible to identify either the coins or the participants in any individual transactions unlike many of the other cryptocurrencies the original monero designers did not block off a set of coins for themselves instead the entire pool of digital coinage was released for public useunfortunately the deeply secure and anonymous nature of monero has found an appeal among criminals in late  europol the eus equivalent of the fbi released a report indicating that monero along with ether and zcash has been adopted by darknet operations monero in particular has proven popular with darknet operators even to the point that malware has been found to be mining monerobytecoin bcnmarket capmax supply  bcncirculating supply  bcnmineable yesbytecoin is in many ways functionally similar to monero both monero and bytecoin were derived from the opensource cryptonote application protocol like monero bytecoin has default transaction privacy like monero bytecoin has mixed coins making tracking individual coins theoretically impossible like monero bytecoin has full participant security providing anonymity to both parties in a transactionas with some other alt currencies there is some controversy about the nature and anonymity of bytecoin while the coin is mineable we do find it curious that the maximum supply at least according to coinmarketcapcom and the circulating supply are quite near each other indicating that all the available bytecoins may soon be mined and in circulationbytecoin provides an interesting lesson in cryptocurrency these alt currencies are essentially software and can be cloned like various opensource projects there are often unique features in an implementation forked from a single originating code source but like many open source projects some forks exist merely to be forks or to meet an agenda of the forking developer and may not provide a unique value to users of that technology compared to other available implementationsneo neomarket capmax supply  neocirculating supply  neomineable nountil  neo was known as antshares and originated in china at first glance neo shares many of the characteristics that defined ethereum as a currency platform most notably the idea of smart contractsbut while ethereum smart contracts can be coded in specialty languages like solidity serpent lll and mutan neo contracts can be coded in c java and python additionally while a focus of ethereum is on the creation of new coin types on top of the ethereum platform neo focuses on using the blockchain platform as a method of linking tangible assets to cryptocurrency and algorithmic operations an example of this is a domain name marketplace operated entirely based on the blockchain and smart contractsneo may well be worth watching as one of the few blockchains originating in china it has the potential to appeal to a giant growing market according to some reports neo has already established some level of support from the chinese government and partnerships with giants like the alibaba group the worlds most valuable retailer and microsoftwith a focus on accessible programming languages smart contracts aimed at realworld uses and a strong foothold in what will be the worlds largest market neo seems to have a great deal of potentialpotcoin potmarket capmax supply  potcirculating supply  potmineable nomedical use of cannabis with a doctors recommendation is legal in  states plus guam puerto rico and the district of columbia recreational use of cannabis is legal in eight states an additional  states have decriminalized use but because the federal government still classifies cannabis as a schedule i substance the business of legal weed remains in a sort of limbobanks generally wont accept or provide accounts to businesses in the legal cannabis industry the same is true of credit card processors as a result the cannabis industry which bloomberg estimates will be worth  billion by  has been an almost entirely cash businessas you might imagine the ability to send payments over a distance is difficult with cash thats where cryptocurrencies come in most cryptocurrencies dont abide by general banking regulations as a result there is definitely cannabis trade in bitcoin litecoin and other currencies where theres a need theres a currency and the weed business is no differentin  potcoin was launched as an opensource cannabisindustryoriented alt currency since then the currency has established relationships with some dispensaries and medical marijuana organizations and has reached a market cap of almost  billion at the time of this writing there are other cannabisoriented alt currencies as well including cannabiscoin cann dopecoin dope hempcoin thc and cannacoin ccnin case youre wondering why youve already heard of potcoin this is probably the answer basketball player dennis rodman was wearing a tshirt with the potcoin logo while he was visiting north korea yep north korea these things happenwaves wavesmarket capcirculating supply  wavesmineable nowaves is another currency platform on the par with ethereum and neo but this time initiated in russia what makes waves interesting beyond its basic feature set is the partnership its developed with deloitte cis in russia a unit of the bigfour financial services firm deloitteblockchain technologies are gaining ground already allowing startups investors and other stakeholders to quickly raise significant funds in cryptocurrencies however the cryptocurrency market is relatively young and not all the regulatory mechanisms are in place states artem tolkachev director of legal services for technology projects at deloitte cis he continues this is why we are glad to cooperate with waves platform and are confident that our joint effort will help create the necessary conditions for putting together the legal framework for blockchain projects both in russia and the ciswhether waves will make waves outside of russia and the commonwealth of independent states remains a question even so the partnership with deloitte makes waves worth watchingfinal thoughtsas i said way back at the beginning of this article weve looked at just twelve of the many cryptocurrencies out there investopedia estimates there are more than  but even though weve only scratched the surface this will hopefully have given you an idea of whats available and whats happening in this evergrowing tulpenmanielike marketwhat do you think
