bitcoin famously has an energy problem—by some measures it requires more energy than the entire country of argentina does environmental advocates have repeatedly warned against using this much energy on a virtual currency particularly when so much energy production still feeds global warmingyet there are companies and researchers who are employing bitcoin for sustainable goals they are using the same processes that make the virtual coin energyintensive to soak up overproduced renewable energy and to make agriculture more local and sustainable in doing so they balance out at least a small portion of bitcoin’s energy profligacybitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies use so much energy due to the process by which the coins are created or “mined” miners register complex mathematical transactions to make sure the bitcoin network stays online says alex de vries a dutch data scientist who runs the bitcoin energy consumption index which tracks the network’s energy use “registering these transactions is difficult its like a very big lottery” he says “for that they are rewarded with new bitcoins”unlike standard currencies like the dollar and the euro bitcoin is decentralized and digital no one party controls the coin like a central bank yet at the same time it’s entirely virtual which presents a problem how to prevent users from spending one bitcoin several times in a centralized system that would be easy one party would control the coin and simply register all the transactions in a central databasebut for a decentralized currency that’s not possible hence bitcoin’s elaborate mechanisms to register transactions and prevent double spending when one user transfers a coin to another it gets collected into a “block” together with a group of other transactions socalled miners then compete with each other to get the privilege of registering that block of transactions on the bitcoin network and they do so by having their computers try to solve a mathematical puzzle that requires a lot of processing power so miners have warehouses full of specialized computer chips that compete with those of other miners whoever successfully solves the puzzle first gets to register the block—and receives a reward in bitcoinin this way bitcoin remains decentralized but energyintensive “a lot of these calculations aren’t useful” says de vries “every calculation in the lottery that doesnt guess the solution is useless this is the core of the energy problem”yet bitcoin might have a role in combatting energy waste energy production—particularly in renewables—has an overproduction issue because we cannot control when the sun shines or the wind blows this makes it difficult to align renewable energy production with actual energy use battery technology is stepping into this gap but it’s just getting startedenter energyhungry bitcoin mining the us company  builds bitcoin mining installations with which renewableenergy producers can earn money from their overproduction at the same time bitcoin miners are flocking to areas with abundant renewables like texas where there’s a boom in wind energybitcoin mining might even reduce waste in oil production the startup crusoe energy systems based out of denver uses energy from gas flares to mine bitcoin “flaring occurs in oilfields when the company cannot transport the gas produced as a byproduct” says chase lochmiller crusoe’s ceo and cofounder “so they just burn it the gas is wasted and theres a large emissions footprint associated with the flaring” indeed the international energy agency estimated that in   metric tons of  were emitted because of gas flaring globallycrusoe built a system similar to an engine that combusts the gas and then feeds the resulting power into servers lochmiller claims to have prevented  billion cubic feet of natural gas emissions from entering the environment the energy produced by this process can be used for a variety of purposes like regular data center tasks or even training ai algorithms but one of the key applications is bitcoin mining“we offer regular data center services” says lochmiller “but they have high bandwidth requirements which is challenging when you work in remote locations like oil sites they also have stable power needs while flaring is a volatile fuel source bitcoin mining on the other hand requires limited networking capacities so its easier to do in remote locations and its interruptible”in luleå sweden at the northern edge of the baltic sea mattias vesterlund from the swedish state research center rise is experimenting with other useful pairings with bitcoin mining several data centers including several that mine bitcoin are located in the northern hub because low temperatures help with cooling computer processing produces a lot of heat vesterlund is coordinating several research projects on how to make them more efficient in one case they used hot air from a bitcoin mining data center in a facility that dries wood chips reducing the moisture content of the wood by  percent the sierra club for the record is biomassskepticalin another experiment they want to attach a greenhouse to a bitcoin data center using the heat to produce local food instead of importing it “we need to achieve a symbiosis around data centers” says vesterlund “we want to integrate all these processes into a circular system”but such projects hardly compensate for the wastefulness of bitcoin mining “its absurd that in times of climate change you build a system based on enormous energy waste” says de vries he notes that even though some bitcoin mining uses renewable energy or sources that would otherwise be lost that represents a minority of the energy used a cambridge study from  found that  percent of the energy used by cryptocurrency miners came from renewable sources bitcoin mining systems also work more efficiently if they can operate  according to de vries which makes using overproduced energy more difficult because of its volatilityfinally even if bitcoin energy were use fully renewable the hardware still causes issues the highend chips needed for bitcoin mining are ecologically damaging to produce and wear out in only a few yearsvesterlund remains optimistic “i never owned any bitcoin” he says “but it’s here to stay and we shouldnt neglect it the technology behind it is very clever but it needs to be harmonized with the environment”
