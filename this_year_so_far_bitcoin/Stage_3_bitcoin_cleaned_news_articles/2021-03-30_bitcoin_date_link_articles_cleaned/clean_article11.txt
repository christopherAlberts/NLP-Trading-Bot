when properly incentivized bitcoin is capable of an unfathomable amount of throughput and flexibility that can dwarf visa mastercard swift ach and all of the data management networks on earth yes that includes aws azure and whatever else you’re thinking the bitcoin protocol has no block size limit no chained transaction limit no script limit nor anything else—meaning that anything you can dream of can be built on bitcoinbitcoin “never really hits a scaling ceiling…”– satoshi nakamoto april but this view is extremely unpopular among the commune of blockchain intelligentsia for various reasons the key reason is that in every other blockchain community the coin is the product the community are the salespeople and the goal is the exit buy low shill hard sell highthis is the business model of btc bch ada xrp eos zec trx… even bananothey all exist simply to sell tokens enrich developers pay for suits in silicon valley in stark contrast bitcoin sv bsv is not so much a community as it is an economy where the value of the network is not the token itself but what can be created with the token this is why bsv is so heavily lambasted in the mainstream and the “crypto” media it is a threat to the old world the frothy blockchain community and the old silos of powerbitcoin sv is not the product it is a tool to create value in businesswhat are we up againstbtc – btc core is lauded as digital gold an unconfiscatable asset with impenetrable game theory and no weaknesses although slow expensive and unreliable advocates claim that it can be the new world settlement network in reality btc is poorly implemented has been arbitrarily rolled back twice doublespent censored and confiscated at  transactions per second enabling six megabytes of data per hour—globally—it is several orders of magnitude too inefficient for even periodic settlement of financial assets at scalein contrast bitcoin sv is capable of at least  transactions per second instant payments reliable settlement and flexible implementation everything fundamental about bitcoin is shared between btc and bsv the difference is that btc has deprecated most of bitcoin’s valuable features and it has added other features to limit scalability bsv is a complete implementation of bitcoin which is why it is fast reliable flexible and secureeth – ethereum is roughly three times the efficiency of btc which makes it good for  transactions per second across the network but it is a special purpose tool that operates as a giant computer which must cross all thresholds in unison this makes it easy to program applications from a software standpoint but they can only be as powerful as the weakest link in the network ethereum has a robust development toolset but the network has been bogged down for half a year as users try to figure out how anything with  fees could replace any valuable aspect of the centralized economyin contrast bitcoin sv is at least  times the efficiency of ethereum today this is because of the fundamental efficiency of parallelization innate to bitcoin since the genesis upgrade the explosion of use of the bitcoin stack has created a vast amount of proof that not only can bitcoin apps compete with ethereum apps but we beat them on every single metricapps smart contracts tokens and nfts are faster cheaper more secure and easier to deploy on bitcoin sv they can be built in javascript scrypt native bitcoin script or many other abstractions that are common to developersethereum clones – nearly every other blockchain asset is either a clone of ethereum with slightly different rules or a side chain of ethereum so they all bear the burden of the same fundamental problems cardano polkadot tezos binance coin and “smart chain” vechain tron eos… none can scale most of them are not even capable of  transactions per second and those that claim to be able are years away from the roadmap items to get there– nearly every other blockchain asset is either a clone of ethereum with

most of them are not even capable of  transactions per second and those that claim to be able are years away from the roadmap items to get there shardy dags – iota nano solana hedera hashgraph etc… these alleged solutions to distributed consensus rely on fundamentally different structures that intend to scale but cannot without a more stable base layer dags require a certain amount of existing scale in order to be secure this is why they use centralized authoritative nodes to establish the baseline of the network it’s also why all dag blockchains fall out of sync and have unexpected breakdowns they are fundamentally unreliable unnecessarily complex and don’t actually create any new efficiency hashgraph and iota are only capable of about  transactions per second which is nowhere near what bitcoin sv is capable of nano seems to be much fewer solana claims  transactions per second but the entire network has broken down more than once and it is accomplished by focusing on a very narrow set of parameters solana also uses a very dangerous experimental type of sharding which is a method that creates tons of tiny blockchains for each task – making it unreliable for anything except video gamingfurthermore the bitcoin sv metanet protocol is a dag structure too so the overlay network atop bitcoin sv was very thoughtfully designed to compete on these higher throughput and lower latency networks without compromising the stability that comes from a secure general purpose network built underneath it this makes metanet more efficient and more reliable than iota hashgraph or solana combinedeveryone else nope stellar lumens xrp and the other chains don’t scale eitherin short bitcoin sv does not have competitors blockchain developers continue to try to create specialpurpose networks that focus on narrow use cases while missing the most crucial point bitcoin was created with a perfect balance of security speed and ease of use that cannot be reengineered or broken apart without facing dire consequences and as satoshi said “…it never really hits a scaling ceiling”we have already won and anyone wasting their time trying to find efficiency elsewhere is just burning money that will eventually make its way to bsv anyways stability predictability speed efficiency easeofuse and the only network that allows data and money to scale up for use in the global economy today that’s bitcoin sv and while all of the other blockchain developers have been patting themselves on the back for their gains during the bull market and not working on ways to solve their fundamental problems bitcoin sv has been developing teranode xoken vega and an incredible amount of overlay network options and other scaling solutions that will be debuting just in time for the bear market to start sucking liquidity away from speculative assets while looking for utilitarian safe havenswhen globalscale businesses move to tools that need public transparency perfect ownership reduced payment friction and increased data integrity bsv will be the only optionare you ready for a million transactions per second because when business comes knocking we will benew to bitcoin check
