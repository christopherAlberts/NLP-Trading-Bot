las vegas march   globe newswire  marathon digital holdings inc nasdaqmara “marathon or company one of the largest enterprise bitcoin selfmining companies in north america today announced that the company will be launching the first bitcoin mining pool based in north america that is fully compliant with us regulations including antimoney laundering aml and the office of foreign asset control’s ofac’s standards“the geopolitical value of moving mining pools to north america cannot be understated bitcoin is now no different than any other strategic or rare earth commodity in fact given the number of businesses now leveraging the potential and promise of bitcoin both for distributed ledger benefits and as a reserve and hedge against inflation points to bitcoin being with few peers in how important it is for longterm us interest with the work of the future of digital currency initiative at stanford the team here believes this infrastructure will help further decentralize bitcoin and secure the fidelity of the network in both the short and longterm” stated atticus francken  cofounder and senior fellow future of digital currency initiative at stanford universityto set up its pool marathon has exclusively licensed technology from dmg blockchain that allows the company to filter transactions marathon intends to leverage this technology to ensure that its mining pool adheres to aml regulations and that all transactions are compliant with ofac’s standards as such the pool will refrain from processing transactions from those listed on the us department of treasury’s specially designated nationals and blocked persons list sdn by excluding these transactions all bitcoin marathon mines will be compliant with us regulatory standards“while institutional interest in bitcoin is accelerating many large funds and corporations have expressed concerns over purchasing bitcoin that may have been tainted by nefarious actors” said merrick okamoto marathon’s chairman and ceo “our pools’ initiatives are grounded on decentralization transparency legal compliance with us rules and regulations and independent auditability under us auditing standards while we appreciate some miners’ appetite for processing transactions indiscriminately it is our belief that as a publicly listed company based in the united states and as one focused on enabling more institutional adoption of bitcoin it is our responsibility to follow us regulations we believe that such regulatory compliant mining will allow us to produce ‘clean’ bitcoin which will enable a greater number of institutions to gain exposure to this new asset class ultimately benefiting our organization our shareholders and the broader network”on may   marathon will begin directing  of its hashrate to the new mining pool marathon expects all  of its miners to be deployed by the first quarter of  at which point the company will be directing  ehs to the mining pool on june   the pool will begin accepting other usbased bitcoin mining companiesokamoto continued “currently more than two thirds of bitcoin’s global hashrate is concentrated in pools with little transparency and most reside in one country it is our belief that this concentration of hashrate outside the united states where central authorities could interfere with mining operations without due process poses a risk to the network we believe shifting more mining power to the us could reduce these risks potentially strengthening the network and benefitting all who participate in it if all  ehs of our potential hashrate were pointed towards this pool today our mining pool would be the seventh largest bitcoin mining pool in the world putting north america on the map as a digitalasset mining hub”dan reitzik dmg blockchain’s ceo added
