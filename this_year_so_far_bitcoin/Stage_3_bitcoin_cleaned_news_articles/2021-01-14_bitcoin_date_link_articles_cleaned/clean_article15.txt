originally slated for dec   bitcoin core version  is now available for download and includes a handful of notable changes to bitcoin’s primary software implementation most notably bitcoin now supports tor’s latest address format taproot’s code is now live for testing and bitcoin core finally gets manual fee settingwith bitcoin’s price pumping these new features don’t grab headlines every day but the improvements they make to the bitcoin network’s privacy tooling and complex transaction logic are building a stronger foundation as the cryptocurrency sees a new wave of investor interesttaproot is one step closerthe consensus rules for the highly anticipated taproot upgrade which will allow for more complex smart contracts using schnorr signatures have been slightly tweaked since they were merged into bitcoin core in october taproot is also now fully live on bitcoin’s signet a sandbox network for developers to test new software and upgrades before pushing them to bitcoin’s mainnetrelated first mover bidens  plan shows blue wave bitcoiners saw comingwith the code now ready for testing developers can now test the feature before activation begins later this yearfees get a makeoveranother change some  years in the making bitcoin core now allows its users to set manual fees which are denominated in satoshis bitcoin’s smallest unit instead of in bitcoin before bitcoin core relied on a fee estimator for transactions and these fees were set by specifying a bitcoin amount say  btc instead of satoshis  satsprivacyadditionally the new version supports privacy browser tor’s  address before this update tor  addresses could not fit into the message data that bitcoin nodes share to connect with each other core now has a new method to transport these addresses so that nodes can establish peertopeer connections through them a necessary addition as tor  address will no longer be functional by next yearstory continuesthe release also introduces a new blockfiltering system for “light clients” wallets that do not keep a full history of bitcoin’s transaction ledger but queries data as needed from a full node instead of using socalled “bloom filters” to query whatever blocks these wallets need to make transactions now a process called “compact clientside block filtering” makes this possiblerelated bidens  relief package proposal fails to stir bitcoin marketthis new method is more privacypreserving for light clients because the nodes create the block filters ahead of time for the wallets and the wallet will request block data on a casebycase basis to retrieve the specific transaction data they need the old process had wallets requesting specific block data from their peer nodesbitcoin gets a new sandboxbitcoin is also getting a new testing network signet as it’s called is now operational and takes its place beside bitcoin’s other testonly blockchains regtest and testnetthe new signet is centrally controlled and so is more reliable than bitcoin’s other testing grounds there is currently one public signet available though developers can spin up their own as wellother notable changes to bitcoin corebitcoin core now supports descriptor wallets as well these wallets use scripts instead of keys to execute functions so this – among other things – will make it easier for bitcoin core wallets to partake in things like multisignature transactions it will also pave the way for hardware wallet integrationin addition to many other minor tweaks bitcoin core now supports the sqlite database as well as a feature that reduces the amount of rebroadcasting attempts a node makes when it fails to broadcast a transaction to its peers it also comes with a new dashboard for easily viewing network information and peer node datarelated stories
