social media users especially on chineselanguage platforms see parallels between the  bull market prices of bitcoin and eos the native cryptocurrency for the eosio blockchain platform they said polkadot a project started by ethereum cofounder gavin wood and considered to be one of the socalled “ethereum killers” shares similar features and goals of the eosio project which was also born with the ambition of replacing ethereuma screenshot of a jan  post on weibo china’s twitter that claims polkadot is one of the socalled “marketingoriented” tokens that could give retail investors a chance to make “quick money” right after the bitcoin’s bull run “if you miss the opportunity now there won’t be a chance for you to get rich fast after the bull market ends” it wrote in chinese weiboa screenshot of other posts on weibo show warnings from some crypto users in china about polkadot’s potential downfall citing its similarities to eos in ’s bull run weiboafter bitcoin’s price reached its peak in ’s bull run many investors and traders took their profits and moved them into tokens like eos a period of time now called “alt season” prices for eos reached an alltime high at the end of

that eos and bitcoin prices were related in  and  are contentious“correlation not causation” said terry wilkinson chief executive officer at the tokyoheadquartered investment firm anchor value eos “was the latest greatest pieinthesky protocol at that time and as such garnered a lot of hype during that cycle the bull run did not end because eos stopped pumping it was kind of the poster child for that run”blockone created eosio in september  the blockchain provides a platform for developers to create decentralized apps dapps with the promise of improved scalability compared with ethereum the project was also known for its initial coin offering ico which ran from summer  to june  arguably the longestrunning ico in historywith a large amount of its tokens being turned over to hedge funds to manage and make the majority of the investments in the building the eosio ecosystem traders and investors took eos’s price as an indicator of capital inflows to crypto at the time when eos’s price stopped pumping many took it as a sign to exit the marketeosio “failed to catch up to ethereum’s position and hype” jason kim chief investment officer at anchor value added “speed alone did not persuade enough people to buy into eos’ rosy projections”polkadot’s bull case in ’s bitcoin rallysimilar to eosio polkadot is touted as a promising blockchain that may replace ethereum’s dominance it particularly caught the attention of many savvy digital asset investors when decentralized finance defi exploded in the past summermost defi projects are built on the ethereum blockchain the secondlargest blockchain which is thought of as a “world computer” due to its versatility and programmability yet some projects have chosen ethereum alternatives for better scalability and enduser experience with polkadot being one of the more popular onesas a result just as many investors back in  were making bets on eosio for its promise to grab market share from ethereum at the time investors now have shown a “strong” appetite for polkadot’s dot as coindesk reported two months agowith that said many have expressed their doubts about dot’s possible correlation with bitcoin’s latest bull run the main drivers of this round are significantly different from  which were then stirred up by retail investors for the ico boomthese days the market has mostly agreed that large institutional investors and the explosive defi sub sector took off in the past summer are the primary power behind the latest bull marketthe logic behind the two bull runs are completely different according to simons chen executive director of investment and trading at hong kongbased crypto lender babel finance investors who bought bitcoin in this round have not been taking profits from many altcoins such as polkadot“ certainly fills the same slot as eos did last bull run” wilkinson said “there are parallels to draw since  probably has the highest expectations as the new chain on the block but my opinion is that this bull run is different than the last mainly because of the involvement of institutional money that was largely vacant during the  run”and unlike the ico boom many traders and analysts say the fastgrowing realm of defi – semiautonomous exchanges and lenders – has shown much more potential with an ambitious goal to replace the traditional financial world one dayindeed while the “summer of defi” cooled down the sector still remains quite active multiple defi tokens have seen doubledigit growth in the past few days brian brooks the outgoing acting head of the us office of the comptroller of the currency occ wrote in a financial times oped about a future of “selfdriving” banks backed by the defi sectorthus the rapid price growth in dot could just be a reflection of the defi’s continuing growth as well as new upgrades and improvements on the projectdenis vinokourov head of research at bequant said a recently released  roadmap by sushiswap a decentralized exchange which includes an integration with polkadot could be the reason why dot’s price has been up
