theres a recent mania taking over the investing world and its called cryptocurrency since the domain name bitcoincom was registered in  the world has seen bitcoin cryptobtc rise and fall hitting just under  per token on feb  while many people are bullish on bitcoins prospects many others feel its just too risky for an average investor to hold in their portfolio which side are you on we asked three motley fool contributors whether theyre planning to add it to their portfolios and why or why notthe best cryptocurrency to buyjon quast when building a portfolio investors should be more focused on stocks than cryptocurrencies stocks represent ownership stakes in real companies with intrinsic value by contrast cryptocurrencies are just zeros and ones  they dont own anything generate revenue or have visions for creating shareholder value some do have practical utility which is great but lack of intrinsic value makes cryptocurrencies risky investments its a key difference between them and stocksthat said i would invest in a cryptocurrency but bitcoin is the only one id buy right now cryptocurrency prices are determined by supply and demand the supply side of bitcoins equation is extremely simple new tokens are continuously unlocked and released into circulation through mining there are already  million in circulation according to blockchaincom and theres only a trickle of about  new tokens per day as bitcoin heads toward its ceiling its source code limits the total number of tokens to  millionother cryptocurrencies also have limited supplies however demand for bitcoin sets it apart  this is the one people want to own many other cryptocurrencies have launched addressing bitcoins various shortcomings nevertheless bitcoin remains the cryptocurrency with the most brand recognition so its still the one people consider buying first and i dont see that changing anytime soongrowing adoption creates a kind of network effect after all its not so scary to buy a little bitcoin once someone you know or trust has bought some i believe weve seen this trend with individual investors in recent years but in recent months i think weve started to see it from wall street as well tesla wasnt the first public company to buy bitcoin but its  billion purchase could be a watershed momentteslas management indicated it bought bitcoin as a small hedge against inflation what if more companies followed teslas lead taking just  of their asset value and putting it into bitcoin if just a fraction of public companies did this demand would easily outpace new supply for much of  leading to higher prices if adoption from institutions and companies grows like this i wouldnt be surprised to see bitcoin hit  per token this yearhowever to be clear im not personally buying bitcoin right now because i already bought some in  and its recent surge in price has elevated the cryptocurrency to a large position in my portfolio with a winning stock id be tempted to double up and add to my winner but i dont plan to do that with a cryptocurrency like bitcoin i want to entrust the majority of my investing dollars to the companies creating shareholder value in the real worldin short i believe theres a good case for owning some bitcoin  but not at the expense of holding ownership stakes in top companies that are changing our world for the betterbitcoin for a retirement portbarbara eisner bayer about seven or eight years ago a  friend introduced me to a new type of currency that in his opinion was going to take over the world it was bitcoin and he had purchased a bit of it even though he had no investing experience he wanted my opinion and as a buyandhold investor i felt that the cryptocurrency was too speculative and there was no way i would ever buy itfastforward to today and bitcoin has come a long way it made its tv debut on the good wife in  major companies like microsoft burger king and home depot started accepting it for payment and elon musks tesla recently purchased a whopping  billion worth of it even bill gates said that digital money is a good thingin other words bitcoin has gone mainstream in fact it recently traded for close to  per token and venture capitalist jeremy liew claims that it could be worth  per token by ive been equally impressed and dumbfounded by bitcoins growth in the real world and sometimes get a little upset that i didnt purchase some when my friend first mentioned it to me but only a little upset because my portfolio is on a focused path to funding my retirement and i dont believe bitcoin has a place therefirst of all its extremely volatile its reached huge highs yet once lost  of its value for a retirement portfolio that kind of fluctuation is too ulcerproducing  especially since as i get closer to living off my savings i want to preserve my assets with bitcoin the risks are just too highalso theres no guarantee that it will ultimately be successful as a means of currency even though more businesses are beginning to take it but you just never know at this point i see investing in bitcoin as akin to gambling and im not willing to take that chance right nowcall me chicken call me shortsighted call me oldfashioned im staying far away from cryptocurrencies as bill gates told bloomberg if you have less money than elon  you should probably watch out since my fortune is nowhere close to musks im going to take the microsoft founders advice and sit on the sidelinespassing up the hottest investment of the past decadesean williams i wont beat around the bush i have no intention of adding bitcoin to my portfolio while i believe theres a future for blockchain technology and understand that bitcoin is benefiting from its firstmover advantage in the crypto space there are a handful of reasons i choose not to invest in the worlds largest digital currencyperhaps the biggest issue with bitcoin is its utility although a greater number of businesses are willing to accept bitcoin as a form of payment or have even added it to their balance sheets research from fundera notes that only  businesses in the us accept bitcoin thats out of more than  million registered businesses in the us  million of which are large enough to have at least one employeeto build on this point roughly  of all accounts that own bitcoin hold more than  of the circulating supply according to flipside crypto even though tokens are divisible down to eight decimal places  of a bitcoin token is a satoshi there arent enough tokens to go around for bitcoin to offer gamechanging utilityim also concerned that bitcoin lacks staying power theres no question its the most popular cryptocurrency at the moment but among financial industryfocused blockchains its not even the best option for instance transactions on stellars cryptoxlm network with the lumen coin xlm can be validated and settled in mere seconds meanwhile the average bitcoin transaction takes closer to  minutes to validate and settlethats a vast improvement over traditional banking networks but nowhere near the best among financialindustryfocused blockchain projects in my view this makes bitcoin replaceable  especially considering the virtually nonexistent barrier to entry in the crypto spacehistory provides me with my final reason to stick to the sidelines ive seen many nextbigthing investments ascend to the heavens  the internet businesstobusiness commerce genomics  printing marijuana and blockchain  and the one constant is that all bubbles burst this isnt to say winners wont eventually emerge from these trends but investors almost always overestimate the speed of their uptake and their nearterm potentialinstead of adding bitcoin to my portfolio im perfectly content buying and holding ancillary cryptocurrency stocks thatll benefit no matter what happens to bitcoin for instance i purchased fintech stock square nysesq during the march  coronavirus crash and would consider adding more on sizable pullbacks squares peertopeer payment platform cash app has seen a major uptick in bitcoin exchange over the past year which is providing a big lift to revenue and cash app can remain a major growth driver no matter what happens to the price of bitcoin
