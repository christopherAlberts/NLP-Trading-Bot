btc hashpower swells bitcoin network touches  exahash hashrate climbs  since during the last week the bitcoin network’s hashrate has jumped to a record high of  exahash per second on march   the hashpower has relentlessly continued to rise climbing a whopping  in five years since january  bitcoin price jumps over  in a year hashrate climbs  in five yearsthe price of bitcoin btc touched an alltime high ath reaching  per btc on march   it happened pretty much one year after the crypto asset’s most recent market bottom on march   the price had risen over  since that day otherwise known as ‘black thursday’ which saw btc prices slide to  per unitbtc prices are down over  since the recent ath and the value of the leading crypto asset has driven mining profitability a touch after btc hit the ath in value btc miners ramped up the hashrate to  exahash per second ehs the day after on march  bitcoin mining is extremely competitive and with the hashrate so high the network’s mining difficulty is also at extreme heights as well currently it’s never been more difficult to mine the leading crypto asset than it is today with charts currently measuring  trillionthere are  mining pools directing hashrate at the btc blockchain and  was the number one miner for the last few months on end however ’s hashrate has slid some and poolin now captures the number one bitcoin miner in terms of hashrate distributionpoolin and  have close to the same speeds as poolin now commands  ehs with  of the hashrate and  captures  ehs and  of the overall hashrate the pool operated by crypto firm binance holds the thirdlargest position with  of the btc hashpower ehs is a phenomenal speed and other sites like forklol recorded upwards of  ehs on that day to compare this with speeds five years ago data shows btc’s hashrate has jumped  when it touched  ehs that yearsince  a single mining rig improved by  institutions purchase tens of thousands of next generation minersthe price of bitcoin btc has surely helped drive the hashrate to the number we are seeing today however other technological advances have fueled bitcoin’s hashpower as well at that time in  when the hashrate was  ehs machines like bitmain’s  series were the dominant miners in the industryyet at that time mining rigs did anywhere between  to  terahash per second ths today machines manufactured by bitmain and other competitors like microbt process hash at around  ths that’s an improvement of  efficiency per applicationspecific integrated circuit asic mining machine in five years’ timefrom  through  the  semiconductor was the standard chip at the time for asic mining rigs the company bitfury had released what was called one of the “fastest” mining chips that could reach around  gigahash per second while keeping the power efficiency around  joules per gigahashin december  bitfury’s mining pool captured over  of the overall btc hashrate but today bitfury’s mining pool has zero hash  asic mining chips have been replaced by far more efficient   and even  semiconductors moreover companies are preparing to build even faster models with better chipsets in the futurethere’s also been a massive surge in institutional interest in bitcoin mining as large orders of mining rigs have been ordered in  and into  for instance the company marathon group broke records when it purchased  nextgeneration bitcoin miners from bitmain the publicly listed canadian bitcoin mining operation bitfarms revealed the company purchased  microbt whatsminer mining rigseven with a high  per kilowatthour kwh the top mining rig the microbt whatsminer   captures over  per day the bitmain  pro  series machine gets  per day as well using current exchange rateswhat do you think about bitcoin’s hashrate reaching  ehs and mining rig improvements let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section belowimage credits shutterstock pixabay wiki commonsdisclaimer this article is for informational purposes only it is not a direct offer or solicitation of an offer to buy or sell or a recommendation or endorsement of any products services or companies bitcoincom does not provide investment tax legal or accounting advice neither the company nor the author is responsible directly or indirectly for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any content goods or services mentioned in this article
