in  milton friedman the world’s foremost monetary luminary foretold the rise of cryptocurrencies here’s what he had to sayi think that the internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government the one thing that’s missing but that will soon be developed is a reliable ecash method whereby on the internet you can transfer funds from a to b without a knowing b or b knowing a the way i can take a  bill hand it over to you and then there’s no record of where it came from you may get that without knowing who i am that kind of thing will develop on the internet and that will make it even easier for people using the internet of course it has its negative side it means the gangsters the people who are engaged in illegal transactions will also have an easier way to carry on their businessmore than  years after friedman’s prediction the speculative mania surrounding cryptocurrencies is breathtaking just consider that bitcoin’s price has skyrocketed  percent in the past twelve months and that its market capitalization has soared to  trillion which makes it the world’s sixthmost valuable assetwith elon musk’s announcement that tesla would purchase  billion worth of bitcoin in order to start “accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for  products in the near future” the frequency of bitcoin’s mentions on google and its trading volume have risen sharply and in lockstep in putting aside bitcoin’s meteoric ascent in price which has been punctuated by dramatic booms and busts it is important to note that its designation as a “cryptocurrency” is a misnomer a currency is characterized by four fundamental features to qualify it must be unit of account must be a standard for deferred payment must be a store of value and must serve as a medium of exchangejust how does bitcoin stack up when it comes to these currency criteria bitcoin’s volatility turns out to be its achilles’ heel in  bitcoin’s annualized daily volatility was an astonishing  percent if we look at the most important price in the world the usd–euro exchange rate and the world’s international currency the us dollar the dollar’s annualized daily volatility in  was only  percent since bitcoin’s source code predetermines that bitcoin’s supply will ultimately be fixed and totally inelastic all market adjustments can take place only via price changes not quantity changes as a result it is destined to be inherently subject to extreme price volatility this means that bitcoin will never serve as a reliable unit of account you will rarely see items with bitcoin price tags attached you will also never see deferred contracts contracts under which payment is made under a longterm credit arrangement written in bitcoin can you imagine someone writing a mortgage contract denominated in bitcoinstory continuesbitcoin’s volatility also renders it unattractive for most corporations to hold in lieu of cash reserves indeed bitcoin which is considered an intangible something incidentally that brings inconsistent and opaque accounting treatment in its wake throws considerable risk on to balance sheets in short it is not a reliable store of value it’s no surprise therefore that most corporations are unwilling to take on the risks associated with holding bitcoin on their balance sheets a recent survey found that roughly  percent of finance executives said that “they planned to hold bitcoin as a corporate asset in ” and “ percent of respondents said they did not plan to ever hold bitcoin as a corporate asset” citing volatility as their foremost concernfurthermore very few items are purchased with bitcoin items are not only not priced in bitcoin but the transaction costs associated with bitcoin are excessively high for both buyers and sellersbitcoin clearly falls short of meeting the four standard criteria to be designated as a currency accordingly it should not be viewed as a currency but as a speculative asset with a fundamental value of zero that being said bitcoin does have an objective market price that price is determined by speculators operating in a whirlpool in which they are purchasing an asset with very little or no utility in the hope of selling it later at a higher price greater fools and all thatif bitcoin’s failure to meet the currency criteria isn’t bad enough it even falls short of the aims of its architect or architects the pseudonymous satoshi nakamoto who envisioned that bitcoin would function as a currency nakamoto anticipated that bitcoin would address three problems with “government” money each of which bitcoin fails to solvefirst nakamoto asserted that bitcoin would overcome the lack of trust associated with fiat monies issued by central banks but bitcoin which is fiat has a history defined by fraud and breaches of trust illustrated by the mt gox scandal second nakamoto designed bitcoin to address privacy concerns however about  percent of all cryptocurrency trading occurs on centralized exchanges these exchanges often collect identifying information from their users and have a history of failing to protect such information finally nakamoto complained of the “massive overhead costs” of commercial bank transactions that “make micropayments impossible” yet due to technological limitations and fees charged by exchanges and cryptopayment providers bitcoin is impractical and too costly to facilitate most transactions for example popular cryptocurrency exchange coinbase charges a “base rate for all purchase and sale transactions in the us  ”beyond bitcoin there is ample potential for innovation in private money specifically a pricestable digital asset several attempts have been made such as the popular stablecoin tether and facebook’s libra but these efforts have been fraught with problems tether claims to be “ backed by our reserves” however in  an investigation by new york attorney general letitia james found that “tether’s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by us dollars at all times was a lie” additionally as reported by bloomberg jpmorgan chase  co strategists including josh younger and joyce chang wrote in a report that tether has “famously not produced an independent audit and has claimed in court filings that they need not maintain full backing” this is less than reassuring libra failed to establish itself in its original form and renamed and restructured is supposed to be relaunched in the near futurethanks to ease of entry and competition inferior cryptocurrency products will struggle in the end to survive just look at bitcoin although its market capitalization has skyrocketed bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market has fallen from  percent in april  to  percent today eventually bitcoin’s current limited use value will likely be eclipsed by the offerings of superior challengers so just what might an effective competitor look likeit would be in the form of a private cryptocurrency board a traditional currency board issues a currency that is freely convertible at an absolutely fixed exchange rate with a foreign anchor currency or gold therefore under a currencyboard arrangement there are no capital controls the currency issued by a currency board is backed  percent with anchorcurrency reserves so with a currency board its currency is simply a clone of its anchor currency currency boards have existed in about  countries and none have failed — including the north russian currency board installed on november   during the russian civil warwhat all currency boards — past and present — have in common is that they are public institutions but there is no requirement that currency boards be publicly owned a private cryptocurrency board would be the ideal institutional arrangement for the crypto world for example its home offices and reserves could be located in switzerland a safehaven financial center and it could be governed under swiss law it could be operated with a small staff as is the case with all traditional currency boards as for its anchor it could be a currency issued by a central bank or gold which is not issued by a sovereign furthermore given its digital nature the balancesheet information of a private cryptocurrency board including its reserves could be publicly available and audited by independent auditors on a regular basiswith such a system the crypto world would finally have a product that is more than just a speculative house of cardssteve h hanke is a professor of applied economics at the johns hopkins university in baltimore he is a senior fellow and the director
