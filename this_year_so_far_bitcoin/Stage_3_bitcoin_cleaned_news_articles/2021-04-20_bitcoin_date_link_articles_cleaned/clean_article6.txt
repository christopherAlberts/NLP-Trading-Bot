in many aspects of life we have a tendency to assume a zero–sum approach to decisionmaking what is good for one side is decidedly and proportionately disadvantageous for the other heads i win tails you lose you are either a dog or cat person a skier or a snowboarder prefer the aisle or window seatbut nothing is one dimensional in today’s complex and multifaceted investment universe the vast majority of decisions are actually nonzerosum especially if we consider the trillions upon trillions that comprise the global capital marketsrussell starr is president ceo and director of trillium gold mines inc a director of canada nickel company and a senior advisor to defi technologies he will be speaking at consensus by coindesk our virtual experience may  register herewhen it comes to cryptocurrencies and gold the popular narrative is that the former is stealing the latter’s thunder – crypto’s gains are gold’s losses again the impulse to distill it down to an eitheror scenario comes with a very costly lesson your money the prudent asset mix considers the maximum return for the lowest level of volatility as in the case of gold and crypto each fulfils a complementary function as a repository of value in a global context of uncertainty and looming inflationthe gold market is estimated at over  trillion which reflects a  head start as a globally recognized medium of exchange and value by contrast bitcoin has a market cap of about  trillion even the amount of physical gold held by central banks and investors equates to many times bitcoin’s current market in  gold’s average daily volume was  billion or roughly  times bitcoin’s daily spot volume of some  billion notwithstanding both assets have highly liquid markets meaning there is undeniably ample space for both crypto and gold to flourishso rather than view crypto and gold as competitors an acceptable analogy might be to consider crypto as the legitimate offspring or spinoff with certain common markers they both have low correlation to other families of assets and they are inflation–sensitive great diversifiers and alternatives to fiat issues gold is a reliable ageold secure store of value and the other a new generation that is growing and evolving quick to react but lacking the wisdom of longevitysubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policywhile investors in the us are jumping onto the crypto bandwagon – which might create the impression that gold is passé – elsewhere in the world people long accustomed to buying gold are only now open to considering cryptoinvestors should be cautious that investing in crypto at the wrong time can result in rapid and severe losses anything that can appreciate unimaginably quickly may be prone to severe corrections nothing is guaranteed while crypto is embraced in north america and some other countries it is practically banned in china and frowned upon in south koreaan acceptable analogy might be to consider crypto as the legitimate offspring or spinoff with certain common markersas a believer in both gold and crypto particularly defi i can envision gold’s reinstatement in north american portfolios at  highs that doesn’t preclude investors from diversifying into other asset classes such as crypto there are already signs of inflation much more so than the feds would have you believe and as governments continue to print money it will continue its upward trajectory that means the price of gold bitcoin ethereum and critically decentralized finance defi will all benefitthe view held by peter schiff a former chief economist and strategist of euro pacific capital that cryptocurrencies are not money and that investments in them are foolhardy is flawed in my opinion inarguably the value of anything lies in what one is willing to pay for it the fate of any currency digital or otherwise is in the hands of the financial institutions and credit card companies that actualize its relevanceas defi protocols grow built off the back of ethereum and bitcoin you simply can’t argue that these digital entities have no value crypto’s value driven by defi alone could make it worth the value of all the traditional financial marketsthe psychology of investing has shown that reasonable and rational behavior almost never coincide one might think that a bitcoin necklace is worthless when in reality it’s not there are very astute institutional investors and savvy legendary macro investors who believe that crypto is the future because it’s creating a cryptoeconomy that can run without government–based monopolies that exist nowthink of it as facebook  or email  – back in the  email and certainly facebook barely existed email was a burgeoning novelty appreciated by few no one expected to use email as legal tender or was convinced the internet was safe yet look at where we are today things change before we know it which lends credence to the notion that cryptocurrencies and destabilizing defi protocols are here to staythe benefits of crypto defi and blockchain technology are immense – whether it’s know your client kyc the elimination of terrorist financing or eliminating proceeds of crime – cannot be underestimated these protocols are significant advantages over gold which can be made untraceable some still think the nazi gold hordes reside in gold vaults all over the world – no one can argue these are not direct proceeds of terrorismif we foresee a place for gold and crypto in the future over time i expect they will couple and correlate that’s if the past is any indication if bitcoin can conceivably reach – and gold – in the near to medium term people will be likely to invest in both and the defi protocols that grow off the ethereumbitcoin and other blockchains may be worth hundreds of thousands of multiples more
