london icisgeorgian authorities should immediately scrap electricity subsidies to curb illegal cryptocurrency mining in abkhazia which threatens to deepen economic imbalances and the country’s dependence on russian imports a senior researcher at a tbilisibased think tank told icisgivi adeishvili head of economic and social policy direction at the institute for development of freedom of information idfi said percapita electricity consumption in the northwestern abkhaz region is now  times higher than in the rest of the countrywhile overall georgian electricity consumption was down  year on year in  it increased by  to  over the same period in the black sea provincemore specifically percapita consumption in georgia was  in  but the same figure for abkhazia was cheap electricity delivered to the province is used for cryptocurrency mining adeishvili said“even if we were to allow for economic growth and high energy inefficiency which would increase electricity consumption these would still not explain the levels we currently see in abkhazia” he saidhe warned that if the practice is not reined in georgia’s electricity deficit would increase deepening its dependence on russian or azerbaijani importslegal cryptocurrency mining has been widespread in the whole of georgia in recent years as the country can rely on relatively cheap hydropower production which has encouraged the practice cryptocurrency mining requires high electricity consumptionthis meant that when the first bitcoin bubble occurred in  and prices soared from  in march to just over  towards the end of that year legal cryptocurrency mining accounted for around  of georgia’s total consumptionas the bitcoin price fell in  overall electricity consumption from legal cryptocurrency farms in georgia shrank to  of that year’s total demand adeishvili said electricity prices in georgian provinces have also increased in the meantimeillegal cryptocurrency mininghowever illegal cryptocurrency mining continued underground particularly in the abkhaz region which receives electricity from the georgian enguri hydropower plant at prices that hover around us  compared to  paid by georgian consumersthe situation is compounded by abkhazia’s ambiguous political status although the region has been under de facto russian control following the russiangeorgian war of  it is still internationally recognised as being part of georgiaunder existing arrangements georgia supplies electricity to abkhazia as the  enguri power plant straddles the georgiancontrolled upper svaneti territory and the gali district of abkhazia the two initially agreed for electricity generated at the facility to be supplied in equal measure to bothhowever with the increase in electricity demand in abkhazia the province offtook  of the output in  according to a recent idfi report coauthored by adeishvilithe situation took a further twist in january when the enguri power plant went into planned maintenance it is expected to be offline until the end of mayrussian importsto plug the shortfall abkhazia ramped up russian electricity imports adeishvili said the official cost of russian offtake is not known but the researcher said the cost may be around the import bill is thought to be shouldered by georgia because devolving it to abkhazia would implicitly mean acknowledging its separatist statushowever georgia cannot recover its costs internally because abkhazia pays only subsidised electricity prices which are significantly cheaper than in the rest of the countryearlier this year the unrecognised abkhaz parliament passed a package of bills including steep fines for illegal use of electricity and extended by another year a ban on cryptocurrency mining until may however adeishvili doubted the ban could be enforced as there is a lack of transparency and electricity metering in abkhazia the province is also very poor and the value of bitcoin has now soared close to adeishvili said that as long as abkhazia pays electricity prices of  and cryptocurrency prices remain high the ban is impossible to enforce“as long as bitcoin prices are  even electricity prices at  are attractive” he explainedicis contacted both the georgian ministry of energy and the unrecognised abkhaz parliament for comment neither replied by publication time
