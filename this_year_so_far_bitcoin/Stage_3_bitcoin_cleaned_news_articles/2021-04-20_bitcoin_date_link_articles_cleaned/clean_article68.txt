too late to invest but history suggests this is not the casewhen looking at past performance data we see that each time cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum hit a new high they go through a period of consolidation before hitting yet a new high this has been the story of cryptocurrencies over the last decade says sean sanders ceo and founder of revixas value investor bill milner noted “ gets less risky the higher it goes” because it is still early in the adoption cycle that’s the opposite of what happens with most stocksadds sanders while there are always sceptics to new technology and an investment category that has produced eyewatering returns one thing has become ever clear over the years cryptocurrencies are here to stay in an increasingly digitised world“blockchain technology is one of the asset classes paving the way into the fourth industrial revolution  it has allowed people to build decentralised applications with a multitude of use cases such as peertopeer financial transfers without an intermediarythe source of returnsover the past  years the cryptocurrency market capitalisation has grown from  billion to over  trillion an   growth of this bitcoin makes up just over  trillion making it larger than the three biggest banks in the world combined including jp morgan chase bank of america and the industrial and commercial bank of chinasource revixcomalthough bitcoin grabs all the headlines it is the alternative coins or altcoins which are all cryptocurrencies that are not bitcoin that have been amassing even more impressive returnsif we exclude bitcoin the altcoin market has seen a growth of   over the past five years which amounts to compound annual growth of  a year this growth is partly due to the rise in decentralised finance defi defi is a subsector of the cryptocurrency industry where entrepreneurs are building semiautomated trading and lending systems atop of blockchain networksa closer lookthe chart below shows the remarkable returns of altcoins like cardano up more than   over  months binance coin   and chainlink   each of these has different use cases cardano is building a robust blockchain on which to host a new financial architecture to compete with ethereum while binance coin is a cryptocurrency that fuels the binance smart chain a centralised blockchain owned by crypto exchange binance that is competing with others to become the dominant player in this fastdeveloping spacesource revixcomwith this growth the total number of cryptocurrencies in existence has increased to over   to put that
