nvidia the maker of graphic cards has decided that they will deliberately lower the efficiency of their latest graphic cards by  when they are used to mine cryptocurrencies there has been a huge graphic card shortage because bitcoin and similar currency miners have been using them nvidia is intervening in this situation to make sure that their cards end up with gamers but they might also end up selling special versions for mining tooas of now the supply chain for graphic cards has been average at best while the demand for graphic cards has increased to record numbers john peddie research jpr has found that in just the first quarter of  around  million cards were sold if you look at previous years only around  million cards were shipped throughout the year this has resulted in the shortage of graphic cards like never seen before to get more information about the bitcoin trading you can visit bitcoin revolution appwhat’s the problemgraphic cards are really important for gaming computers since they can result in high frame rates and the resolutions that gamers want however there have already been manufacturing issues during the pandemic of  which created shortages anywaycryptocurrency investors also started buying them out to process transactions and generate bitcoins cryptocurrencies are becoming more and more popular since these digital coins are gaining more acceptance with big names like elon musk talking about them and even the significant investment that tesla made on bitcoin it is resulting in an even greater focus on mining the coins miners started to build rigs with several cards to create a machine that could handle mining to be costeffective it has to generate enough bitcoins than it costs for the electricity and hardwarejpr found that amd was only able to ship around  million cards by the end of  while they had managed to supply  million in  of  the pandemic slowed down the production of graphic cards in a major way impacting the supply chaingames have been waiting for highperforming graphic cards for years but cryptocurrency miners have also come to buy them because they present the possibility of virtual machines for cash this has also resulted in a hike in prices for graphic cardsthe nvidia geforce rtx  board alone costs around  right now which had a recommended price of  just some time ago the geforce rtx  costs  when it once fetched  even average cards like the geforce rtx  are sold for  now the radeon rx  series by amd has gone up in price with the cheapest going for what’s nvidia doingnvidia is now producing the geforce rtx  card which will slow down ethereum mining transactions by  this will make it less costeffective for crypto miners that need the card for mining it is currently focusing on ethereum and not bitcoin because it has the most global mining yields than other coins they maintain that this change in production won’t affect graphic card availabilityat the end of the day…critics of bitcoin suggest that while the new cards may use less energy crypto mining is still quite wasteful in terms of energy bitcoin mining and graphic card shortages are just outlining how more efficient hardware for mining doesn’t really help but rather just causes more problems david gerard the author of a book called ‘attack of the  foot blockchain’ suggests that bitcoin and other cryptos are antiefficiency the highenergy use by bitcoin and the  it produces continue to spiral to new heights he says “it’s very bad that all this energy is being literally wasted in a lottery”this article does not necessarily reflect the opinions of the editors or the management of econotimes
