the united states will adopt bitcoin as a reserve assetwhy because it is unequivocally in us strategic interests to do soalex treece is a cofounder at zabo a platform enabling fintechs and financial services companies to easily connect cryptocurrency accounts to their applicationsthe question is not if this will happen but when whether it happens within  months two years five years or  years will have major implications for us positioning for decades failure to embrace bitcoin sooner rather than later will damage us strategic interests and benefit rivals adopting it firstby examining how the us and other countries manage their reserve assets today we can already see the logic for this transition to occurgolden empiretoday the us holds  million troy ounces  metric tons of gold or about  billion worthsubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policythis makes the us the largest holder of gold in the world – by a wide margin – with over two times the amount of the next largest holder germanyhistorically there was a very good reason for the us to own gold the us dollar was pegged to its value yet the us broke with the gold standard in  ushering in the fiat currency age that has existed ever sinceso why exactly do the us and other countries continue to own all this goldhere are some of the reasons provided directly from central bankers themselvesgold is the de facto safehaven asset it is an insurance policy against any major economic monetary or geopolitical shifts given gold’s ample liquidity and universal appeal countries can easily liquidate it for other assets in turbulent timesgold is both independent of any given country’s economic or monetary policies while also having a fixed supply on earth with relatively stable supply growth making it an ideal hedge against both monetary inflation and fluctuations in other reserve assetsgold is viewed as “nobody’s liability” it cannot be frozen in a bank account or defaulted on when frictions between countries arisecombine these reasons with the cultural importance of gold and it’s uncontroversial to say that having more gold than everyone else is a very good thingfort knox bitcoin’s similarities to gold are well documented earning it the appropriate nickname of “digital gold”yet while bitcoin shares many similarities with gold including scarcity stable supply inflation fungibility and durability it also makes major improvements over gold in some key areaswhen gold is in high demand miners are incentivized to dig up more of it increasing its supply bitcoin’s supply does not change in the face of demand making it less inflationary and more predictableit’s far easier and cheaper to verify the authenticity of bitcoin than goldbitcoin is much easier to transfer than gold and costs much less to store securelybitcoin is easily divided whereas gold is notfor these reasons a rapidly increasing number of people companies and institutional investors agree that having more bitcoin than everyone else is a very good thingtoday this includes the world’s richest man highly conservative longterm thinking asset managers industry leading companies and the most prominent macro investors in the worldtomorrow it will include countries toosovereign technoeconomic gamesso far countries and their central banks have resisted publicly making or disclosing investments in bitcoinin fact they’ve done the opposite in some cases european central bank head christine lagarde was quoted saying it’s “very unlikely” central banks would make the move into bitcoin in the near future nigeria’s central bank recently reiterated its outright ban of cryptocurrency india’s parliament proposed its own crypto ban despite the country’s supreme court ruling it lawfulsee also garrick hileman – governments will start to hodl bitcoin in these negative actions have occurred in the name of protecting the existing fiat currency regime eg nigeria or limiting competition for planned central bank digital currencies eg indiabut there is near certainty that this dynamic will ultimately reverse potentially within the next  monthswhy simple economic incentivesin the near term there exists an irresistible arbitrage opportunity for a country silently to accumulate a bitcoin position and later announce its holdings bitcoin being adopted as a sovereign reserve asset is often considered the “final boss” of adoption milestones it finally happening would send an ultrabullish signal and vaporize doubts among traditional investor holdouts including other central banksthe resulting adoption acceleration would bestow huge windfalls for early adopter countries who managed to accumulate early in this transitionthe outcomes of these sovereign technoeconomic games determine the fate of empiresin the longer term bitcoin represents a sovereign wealthbuilding opportunity with asymmetric riskreward upsidelet’s assume a country agrees and decides to buy a relatively small hedge position in bitcoin  of its reserves the upsides are clear but what’s the downside for being wrong if it turns out that bitcoin never becomes a global reserve asset the nation is simply stuck with owning a rapidly growing highly liquid alternative asset that behaves a lot like goldbut what if it doesn’t buy any bitcoin and it does become a global reserve asset any late adopter country would see its sovereign wealth diminished relative to early adopters and would be forced to capitulate at higher prices lateryet for the us the downside of not being one of the winners of bitcoin is greater than just about anyone elseanother great racethe us is wellknown for using the global financial system – and the us dollar’s status as the global reserve currency – to project its power and punish its adversaries it’s no surprise then that rivals such russia and china have built their gold reserves to historical levels at the expense of usd and us treasurystheir overall goals are clear create alternatives to the current us monetary hegemonyas bitcoin continues to gain adoption and becomes a global reserve asset it will be thrust into this great competition between nationssee also alex treece – the intangible reasons ethereum and bitcoin leadif america’s rivals embrace bitcoin first and take advantage of the reserve asset arbitrage not only will they secure a onceinageneration economic windfall they will also be in position to damage us foreign policy and strategic interestsfortunately the us can avoid this outcome if it acts boldly and embraces bitcoin firstdespite a complete lack of leadership from executive and legislative branches of government so far corporate america and american investors are currently winning this competition for the usmuch of the world’s bitcoin is custodied in the united states many of the iconic companies in the cryptocurrency industry – firms like coinbase gemini bitgo nydig digital currency group coindesk’s parent company and others – are all usbased the vast majority of corporate treasury purchases have been made by us companieswhether to maintain its leading position of power and wealth or to prevent adversaries from gaining an economic and geopolitical edge the right strategic move is very clear the us should play to win with bitcoin this includes being one of the first to adopt bitcoin as a reserve asset and doing everything possible to ensure the us continues to be the home for many of the most innovative cryptocurrency companiesthe us has found itself at the crossroads of many consequential technology shifts before the space race the atom bomb the internet and more recently the race for general purpose artificial intelligence the outcomes of these sovereign technoeconomic games determine the fate of empires
