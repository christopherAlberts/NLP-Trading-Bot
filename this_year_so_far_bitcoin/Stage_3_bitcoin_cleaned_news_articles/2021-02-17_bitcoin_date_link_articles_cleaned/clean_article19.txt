in contrast to other assets like gold bitcoin is purely speculative its value is whatever markets say it is says willem h buiternew york city on feb  elon musk’s electric car firm tesla announced that it had invested  billion of its cash reserves in bitcoin back in january the news helped to boost the cryptocurrency’s already skyrocketing price by a further  per cent to a record high of more than but especially in bitcoin’s case what goes up can just as easily come crashing downadvertisementadvertisementbitcoin was invented in  and began trading in  in  the value of a single bitcoin rose from around eighthundredths of a cent to eight cents in april  it traded at  before subsequently climbing to  by november as recently as mar  last year bitcoin traded at about  but its price has since increased more than sevenfoldtoday bitcoin is a perfect  bubble i once described gold as “shiny bitcoin” and characterised the metal’s price as a  bubbleadvertisementadvertisementthat was a bit unfair to gold which used to have intrinsic value as an industrial commodity now largely redundant and still does as a consumer durable widely used in jewelrybitcoin by contrast has no intrinsic value it never did and never will it is a purely speculative asset – a private fiat currency – whose value is whatever the markets say it isa wasteful and speculative assetadvertisementbut bitcoin is also a socially wasteful speculative asset because it is expensive to producefile photo employees work on bitcoin mining computers at bitminer factory in florence italy april   picture taken april   reutersalessandro bianchithe cost of “mining” an additional bitcoin – solving computational puzzles using energyintensive digital equipment – increases at such a rate that the total stock of the cryptocurrency is capped at  million unitsof course even if bitcoin’s protocol is not changed to allow for a larger supply the whole exercise can be repeated through the issuance of bitcoin  bitcoin  and so on the real costs of mining will thus be replicated tooget cna’s evening brief newsletter invalid email address it looks like the email address you entered is not valid try again this service

wellestablished cryptocurrencies – for example ether – operating in parallel with bitcoinbut as the success of governmentissued fiat currencies shows the universe of speculative bubbles is by no means restricted to cryptocurrencies like bitcoinafter all in a world with flexible prices there is always an equilibrium where everyone believes the official fiat currency has no value – in which case it consequently has no valueand there are infinitely many “nonfundamental” equilibria where the general price level – the reciprocal of the fiat currency’s price – either explodes and goes to infinity or implodes and falls to zero even when the money stock remains fairly steady or does not change at allfinally there is the unique “fundamental” equilibrium at which the price level and the value of the currency is positive and neither explodes nor implodes most governmentissued fiat currencies appear to have stumbled into this fundamental equilibrium and stayed therekeynesians ignore these multiple equilibria viewing the price level and thus the price of money as uniquely determined by history and updated gradually through a mechanism like the phillips curve which posits a stable and inverse relationship between unexpected inflation and unemploymentrealworld hyperinflationsregardless of which perspective one adopts realworld hyperinflations – think of weimar germany or the recent cases of venezuela and zimbabwe – that effectively reduce the value of money to zero are examples not of nonfundamental equilibria but rather of fundamental equilibria gone badvenezuelas currency the bolivar photo afpleo ramirezin these cases money stocks exploded and the price level responded accordinglyprivate cryptocurrencies and public fiat currencies have the same infinite range of possible equilibria the zeroprice equilibrium is always a possibility as is the unique wellbehaved fundamental equilibriumbitcoin clearly is exhibiting neither of these equilibria at the moment what we have instead appears to be a variant of a nonfundamental explosive price equilibriumit is a variant because it must allow for bitcoin to make a possible if unexpected jump from its current explosive price trajectory to either the nice fundamental equilibrium or the notsonice zeroprice scenariothis multipleequilibrium perspective doubtless makes it appear risky to invest in intrinsically valueless assets like bitcoin and other private cryptocurrenciesthe real world is of course not constrained by the range of possible equilibria supported by the mainstream economic theory outlined here but that makes bitcoin even riskier as an investmentbitcoin a textbook example of excess volatilitytesla’s recent bitcoin buyin shows that a large additional buyer entering the market can boost the cryptocurrency’s price significantly both directly when markets are illiquid and indirectly through demonstration and emulation effectsbut an exit by a single important player would likely have a similar impact in the opposite direction positive or negative opinions voiced by market makers will have significant effects on bitcoin’s pricefile photo a gamestop store is pictured in the manhattan

drove gamestop’s share price to unprecedented highs in january followed by a significant correction should serve as a reminder that lacking any obvious fundamental value anchor bitcoin is likely to remain a textbook example of excess volatilitythis will not change with time bitcoin will continue to be an asset without intrinsic value whose market value can be anything or nothing only those with
