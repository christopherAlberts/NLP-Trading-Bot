shareholders were allowed to convert  in pfizer shares to  in zoetis stockin cryptocurrencies instead of spinoffs there are forks bitcoin cash bch also referred to as bcash was created in august  when it forked off from bitcoin btc and anyone who owned a bitcoin received an equal number of bitcoin cashbitcoin cash is a cryptocurrency that started as a fork or copy of bitcoin says jamison sites senior manager and financial services senior analyst at rsm an audit tax and consulting company serving middlemarket businesses in  groups of bitcoin developers put forward competing changes for improvements to the bitcoin protocol the network operators were split on which protocol to adopt because there was no agreement on which proposal to support bitcoin split into two sites saysthe spinoff was due to a philosophical difference within the bitcoin community some developers saw bitcoin as more a store of value while others wanted to encourage its use as a medium of exchangebitcoin cash was created for the latter campbitcoin cash is a hard fork of bitcoin caused by the desire to increase the block size thereby allowing more transactions to process at a time says sean van der wal managing partner at drawing capital group the number of transactions per second was growing so bcash was supposed to allow the cryptocurrency to grow more seamlessly and scale up as a currencybitcoin cash debuted with an initial value of around  at the time bitcoin was trading for around  anyone who owned bitcoin before the fork now had the rights to an equal number of bcash which they were free to transact as they pleased anyone who bought bitcoin after the fork had no rights to bitcoin cashbitcointhe origins of bitcoin are far more mysterious the concept was first outlined in a nowfamous

disintermediate financial institutions it eliminated the need for a trusted third party to verify transactions and mediate disputes instead of spreading the job of verifying transactions across the network where many different parties could use their computing power to verify that bitcoins were sent from one digital wallet to anotheranother novel idea was the hard limits imposed on the total number of bitcoins that could ever exist –  million – as well as a welldefined system for how new bitcoin would be created the pace of bitcoin creation halves roughly every four years currently more than  million or more than  of the final circulation existits scarcity is one of the strongest bullish theses for bitcoin especially concerning the dollar which can be printed ad infinitum by the

currency than bitcoin itselfwhatever limitations bitcoin has as a currency havent stopped companies like paypal pypl zynga znga and overstockcom ostk from accepting it as a form of payment even mastercard ma is bringing cryptocurrency to its network this yearinstitutional buyers are generally more accepting of bitcoin than its bitcoin cash spinoff teslas tsla recent decision to diversify its balance sheet purchasing  billion of bitcoin is indicative of its growing acceptance in the investment communitybitcoin became an investment vehicle and the reserve currency of the cryptouniverse which renders it a prime asset class for diversifying institutional portfolios says van der wal
