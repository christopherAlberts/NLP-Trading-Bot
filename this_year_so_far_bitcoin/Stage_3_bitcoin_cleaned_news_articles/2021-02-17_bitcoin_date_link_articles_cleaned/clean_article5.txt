the price of bitcoin has reached  £ – another alltime high it’s hard to believe that  bitcoin would only buy a couple of pizzas ten years ago it’s even stranger to think that bitcoins are completely virtual you can’t hold one except on a hard drive and there’s no underlying asset to them a bitcoin is simply a digital representation of the computer power needed to make one what’s called its “proofofwork”this isn’t actually a new idea though rai stones were one of the first forms of money used on the micronesian islands of yap to get hold of a rai you had to row a canoe for  or so to palau and chisel away at some local limestone then you needed to take the  lump of rock back to yap without sinking in the pacific no one is quite sure when it started but the practice is at least several centuries old yapese money had no inherent value for everyone to respect the proofofwork the process was deliberately inefficient and incredibly resourceintensive just like bitcoininstead of relying on intrepid voyagers bitcoin uses a global network of competing computers like safe crackers at a safecracking contest these bitcoin mining machines guess the combination to a digital lock a long string of digits with the correct combination winning a few new bitcoins the combination changes every ten minutes and the contest continuesthis might all sound like a harmless game of digital bingo but with more and more people enticed by the heady rewards bitcoin mining on some days uses as much energy as poland and generates  million tonnes of co  each yearnew institutional investors like the carmaker tesla are driving the asset’s price skywards while ignoring bitcoin’s climatechanging appetite and to keep the bull market charging supporters are working hard to argue for bitcoin’s green credentialsfor the sake of a stable climate these myths need debunkingmyth one bitcoin mining is becoming more efficientbitcoin’s carbon emissions are not the network’s only dirty secret in  competing miners could win the bitcoin bingo with an average laptop today viable operations require investing in warehouses filled with specialised hardware known as application specific integrated circuits asic as the majority of mining costs come from energy to run these units bitcoin miners are always careful to use the cheapest to avoid wasting energy the global arms race for bitcoin requires asics to be replaced for newer and more efficient models every yearasics can’t be easily repurposed for general computing redundant units create around  tonnes of hazardous electronic waste each year much of which is dumped on cities in the global southmyth two bitcoin encourages investment in clean energychinese hydroelectric power plants are popular spots for bitcoin mining while china cracks down on the industry  of bitcoin mining is powered by fossil fuelscheap coal in australia has found new buyers through bitcoin as formerly redundant coal mines are reopened to power mining miners are willing to move anywhere for residual energy increasing the profitability of natural gas in siberia and supporting oil drilling in texasin virunga national park in the democratic republic of congo bitcoin miners are getting special access to cheap clean energy produced by an eufunded hydroelectric plant the plant was designed to help locals find livelihoods beyond poaching and stop them resorting to scouring parkland for wood fuel bitcoin miners employ armies of computer servers not the excombatants the plant could helpmyth three bitcoin replaces the need for gold mininggold mining is one of the world’s most destructive industries bitcoin was originally intended as a digital replacement for gold that was also a deflationary means of exchange capable of rendering wasteful banks and regulators redundantbut for many institutional investors gold is being bought to hedge against bitcoin’s volatility tesla poured  billion into bitcoin but also declared an interest in gold while bitcoin is currently experiencing alltime price highs gold hit one of its own in read more gold mining leaves deforested amazon land barren for years find scientistsnor has bitcoin displaced traditional finance institutions major banks are vying to get very rich indeed on the back of itmyth four corporate players will boost market for ‘green bitcoin’some argue that institutional investors can turn bitcoin green yves bennaim the founder of swiss cryptocurrency think tank  claims that as investors like tesla push prices up “there will be more incentive to make investments in renewable sources of energy” for bitcoin mining but miners will always use the cheapest option to maximise returns it’s not possible to allocate additional rewards to miners using renewables because it’s difficult to know exactly which bitcoin miners use renewablesunfortunately there is currently no such thing as a “green bitcoin”not all cryptocurrencies are as energyintensive as bitcoin though there are alternatives to proofofwork the second biggest blockchain project ethereum is switching to proofofstake a new system which is supposed to remove the need for data miners and perpetual hardware updates bitcoins are dirty things but pointing this out to wouldbe investors should not mean throwing the blockchain baby out with bitcoin’s bath water
