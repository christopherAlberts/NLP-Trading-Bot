“property” for tax purposes which means your virtual currency is taxed in the same way as any other assets you own like stocks or goldfor most people who buy and trade crypto within online exchanges accounting for it in your tax return is relatively easy but like most things related to digital currency things can get a lot more complicated the more active you arehere’s what you need to know about which activity you might need to report to the irs and how you can begin planning ahead for your  taxesreporting cryptocurrency trades on your tax returnpurchasing crypto with dollarssimply buying virtual currency with us dollars and keeping it within the exchange where you made the purchase or transferring it to your personal wallet does not mean you’ll owe taxes on it at the end of the yearif your only cryptorelated activity this year was purchasing a virtual currency with us dollars you don’t have to report that to the irs based on guidance listed on your form  tax returntrading cryptocurrencythings start becoming taxable when you use crypto as a method of exchange this includes selling your crypto for us dollars exchanging one cryptocurrency for another — buying ethereum with bitcoin for example — or paying for goods and services with crypto“whenever you sell the investment or exchange the investment for another investment that is when a taxable transaction happens” says daniel johnson a financial advisor and founder of refocus financial planning in asheville north carolina “you’ve got to be careful if you’re doing a lot of trading if you’re going in and out of different types of cryptocurrency every single time you place that trade it is a taxable event”when you’ll owe taxes on cryptocurrencybecause the irs considers virtual currencies property their taxable value is based on capital gains or losses — basically how much value your holdings gained or lost in a given period“when you trade cryptocurrencies or when you spend cryptocurrency to buy something those transactions are subject to capital gains taxes because you’re spending a capital asset to get something or get another asset” says shehan chandrasekera cpa head of tax strategy at cointrackerio a crypto tax software companythe difference between the amount you spent when you bought or received the crypto its cost basis and the amount you earn for its sale is the capital gain or capital loss — what you’ll report on your tax return broadly speaking if you bought  worth of bitcoin and sold it for  you’d see a capital gain of  if your bitcoin lost value in that time you’d instead face a capital loss if your losses exceed your gains you can deduct up to  from your taxable income for individual filersthe amount of time you owned the crypto plays a part too if you held onto a unit of bitcoin for more than a year it would generally qualify as a longterm capital gain but if you bought and sold it within a year it’s a shortterm gain these differences can affect which tax rate is applied the tax rate also varies based on your overall taxable income and there are limits to how much you may deduct in capital losses if your crypto asset loses valueyou can use form  to reconcile your capital gains and losses and then report them on your form  tax return using schedule d the irs’ website has additional information and tools to help you determine your cryptorelated tax liability and how to report it on its websitereporting crypto incomesome people receive virtual currency as payment for services this might mean receiving crypto as income instead of cash earning bitcoin by mining new coins or receiving coins or tokens as reward for certain activities coinbase’s earn rewards program for example regardless of how it’s earned you’ll need to record the value of the crypto in us dollars when it’s received and report that income on your tax return“if i get paid one bitcoin for services i have to grab the fair market value for that bitcoin at the moment i receive it” says pat white cofounder and ceo of bitwave a company that helps businesses with crypto tax reporting “right now if bitcoin is at  i have to record  of revenue as personal income”the irs puts it this way “a taxpayer who receives virtual currency as payment for goods or services must in computing gross income include the fair market value of the virtual currency measured in us dollars as of the date that the virtual currency was received”that fair market value you capture sticks to that coin as the cost basis which is your responsibility to track so if you go and buy something with crypto you’ve earned you’ll need to reconcile its cost basis with its value when you use it for goods or servicesthis irs webpage has additional information on reporting virtual currency income in more specific casestrack your activityone of the most important things to remember as you start dealing in cryptocurrency is that it’s your responsibility to keep track of all your potentially taxable activities as well as the fair market value of your crypto throughout those activitiesthe irs offers only general guidance about the records you’ll need to keep for tax reporting purposes they should be sufficient “to establish the positions taken on tax returns” some examples the agency gives include records of any time you receive sell or exchange virtual currency as well as the fair market value of your virtual currency“that is the big scary thing” white says getting into the crypto space can be incredibly simple “but actually tracking the cost basis and making sure you’re doing it correctly that’s where it gets really tricky”some exchanges may issue a form  to help you determine gains and losses but that’s uncommon ultimately you’re responsible for tracking your taxable activities and your currency’s fair market valueif you leave your virtual currency within your account on the exchange you buy it it’s generally easy to track or generate reports about your transactions but if you move your currency between private wallets or you have crypto in multiple places you’ll need to be more diligent in your trackingthere are cryptofocused tax software programs you can use to simplify the process as long as you input data on all your crypto trades or earnings across all exchanges you’ve used the software will generate the cost basis for your trades and help you determine your capital gains and losses some of these programs — cointracker tokentax cryptotradertax and more — are compatible with regular tax programs like turbotax or taxact so you can easily import the gains and losses they report to your tax returnhow to prepare for tax season when you have cryptothe best thing you can do to simplify your cryptorelated  tax filing is start planning ahead now don’t wait until april   to begin gathering your reports and figuring out what you owe even if that’s how you typically approach tax season“you do not want to be in the situation on april  where you’re trying to catch up with one year’s worth of crypto activity” white says “you really want to treat it more like a business where on a monthly basis you are making sure that all of your taxes are up to date making sure you are tracking things correctly being more proactive about it”if you’re just dipping your toes into trading bitcoin or another cryptocurrency and only have a few transactions with accurate cost basis reporting you may be able to easily report your crypto earnings yourself using your typical tax software“most people are pretty simple they have a  they have a couple  interest forms and they may have some crypto” chandrasekera says “so those people don’t really need a cpa but if you’re somebody dealing with large amounts of money you’re making defi transactions staking or mining operations those people will want to have a cpa to sit down and do tax planning and taxsaving strategies”consider working with a professionaleven if you aren’t conducting complex crypto activities and just have questions about your specific tax obligation or you’re unsure if you’re reporting correctly consider working with a tax professional who has experience interpreting tax code related to virtual currenciesthe irs and other regulators cannot issue guidance on every situation a taxpayer may run into and there are plenty of gaps in current guidance that’s why it’s important to look for a tax professional familiar with current irs guidance and has experience reporting cryptocurrency gains and losses chandrasekera says ask potential tax pros if they own any virtual currency themselves and make sure they acknowledge the uncertainties in the tax code“there are some gray areas and that’s where cpas need to come in and say ‘ok we don’t have direct guidance from the irs but when they set up the guidance this was the intention’” chandrasekera says “as cpas we should be able to use our experience and our overall knowledge about the tax code and apply those rules to the unique cases that we see”irs guidance for virtual currencieshere’s the guidance the irs has issued so far related to virtual currencies and tax reporting
