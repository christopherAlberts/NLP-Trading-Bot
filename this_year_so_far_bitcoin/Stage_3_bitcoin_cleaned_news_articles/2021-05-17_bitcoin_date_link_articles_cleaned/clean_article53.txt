each of the  bitcoin mining pools by hash rate have signaled at least one block for the bitcoin network’s taproot soft fork activationafter bitcoin mining pool btctop recently mined a “green” block the  bitcoin mining pools by hash rate have now all signaled at least one block for taproot activation according to data from taprootwatchbtctop is the tenthlargest bitcoin mining pool by hash rate representing  percent of the entire bitcoin network’s hash power although btccom and binance pool have signaled at least one block taprootwatch considers the most recent block when accounting for a pool so these pools may be presented as not signaling on taprootwatchat the time of writing  percent of the bitcoin network’s hash rate and  percent of blocks are currently signaling support for the activation of the protocol upgrade however there are still  blocks remaining in the current taproot speedy trial signaling epochspeedy trial a variation of  versionbits described in  is a soft fork deployment method in which miners help coordinate the upgrade by signaling support in their mined blocks the method’s signaling period is the bitcoin difficulty adjustment window of  blocks roughly two weekstaproot gets locked in as a bitcoin protocol upgrade for november if  of blocks mined signal readiness during one such period between may and augustwith essential improvements to the bitcoin base layer taproot is highly anticipated it will include privacy and cost benefits and pave the way for further improvements to be implemented in multisignature wallets the lightning network and other smart contracts deployed on the bitcoin blockchain
