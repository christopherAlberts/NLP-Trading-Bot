josef tětek is a satoshilabs and trezor brand ambassadorit’s a tulip mania a ponzi scheme a bubble about to burst you’ve heard it all before and not just from your nocoiner friends this narrative has been pushed for years by many famous economists with a nobel on their shelf why do renowned economists fail to see the value in bitcoin it’s not a failure of understanding it’s a difference of worldviewthe influence of mainstream economics cannot be underestimated as john maynard keynes said “practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences are usually the slaves of some defunct economist madmen in authority who hear voices in the air are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back” this fits current economic policy perfectly so let’s see how the madmen and scribblers view the current economy — and therefore society itselfso what is mainstream economics anywaymainstream economics is mostly a mixture of two dominant schools of economic thoughtkeynesianism in its various forms ie postkeynesianism new keynesianism is heavily focused on the economic aggregates gdp unemployment rate consumer spending inflation measured through consumer price index cpi and such market forces are viewed as chronically inadequate due to various alleged market failures society is in constant need of public goods supplied by the government public spending is a panacea in the eyes of keynesian economists and should be done even at the cost of heavy budget deficits if need be interestingly keynes himself prescribed public deficits only in the downturns but the us budget has been in a deficit in  out of the past  years even in the times of strong economic growthmonetarism also focuses on the economic aggregates but its prescriptions are well monetarist in nature instead of fiscal measures the economy should be aided by the central bank’s actions inflating the money supply manipulating shortterm interest rates stepping in as a lender of last resort buying up mortgages bonds or even equities — all these measures steer the economy from the inevitable crash deflation and unemployment in the eyes of the monetaristtoday’s economic pundits advisors and government officials usually hold these two views of the economy combined thus the economic policy should be liberal with the taxpayers’ money and with their purchasing power as well it’s important to point out that monetarism started to play a role in mainstream economics in the  after the us dollar was decoupled from gold and the whole world found itself under a pure fiat money standard without any link to gold whatsoever in a sense monetarism came to keynesianism’s rescue with everrising debt levels an argument for everlower interest rates needed to be found chronic deficits drive the need to inflate the debt away through easy money policy and easy money policy is in turn a strong incentive to go into more debt — for the government and the economy as a wholewhile an economic policy based on mainstream economics seemed to work over the past decades it is doomed in the long run snowballing debt fueled by easy money policy simply isn’t sustainable and something has to give either the debt will be defaulted upon or the purchasing power of fiat money will evaporate as dylan leclair succinctly puts it “there is mathematically no way out of the current economic environment”the fiat mindsetinstead of money created by the click of a mouse we have money that must be mined — created through resourceintensive computations  in other words cryptocurrency enthusiasts are effectively celebrating the use of cuttingedge technology to set the monetary system back  years why would you want to do that what problem does it solve — paul krugmannow let’s tackle the initial question why do mainstream economists hate on bitcointhe above quote from the renowned nobelist helps us answer the question it’s noteworthy that what a sound money advocate views as the main advantage of bitcoin the mainstream economist understands as its downside for paul krugman an epitome of mainstream economics today bitcoin is a monetary setback because you can’t create sats at the click of a buttonthats a fiat mindset the worldview that the state and its experts should be able to create and inject money at will because they supposedly know better we can call this by its true name monetary socialism the state defines what money is via legal tender laws and sets the monetary policy ie rate of money creation the state decides whom the new money will reach first the state sets the interest rates the state nudges people away from savings and toward debt though the state pays lip service to the market via tools like “open market operations” there really isn’t much room for true market forces in the era of fiat moneyone of the basic functions of money is or should be its role as a store of value but there isn’t a place for that when establishment economists get to work since money can be created from thin air there really isn’t a point to holding it over long term investments you say but why we have credit with everlower interest rates for that what about the safety net welfare programs that’s why you’ll never see a mainstream economist conceding that bitcoin has the store of value quality going for it it’s like asking a colorblind person to enjoy the rainbow they just don’t have the capability to see itand it makes sense from the viewpoint of mainstream economics the only way out of the keynesian debt hole besides outright default is via inflation the idea that money should act as a store of value is preposterous if you have the mainstream worldview money should serve as the medium of exchange it’s enough if it doesn’t hyperinflate in the short term but losing most of its value in the long run is desirablethe austrian alternativeall rational action is in the first place individual action only the individual thinks only the individual reasons only the individual acts — ludwig von misesthe key problem with the mainstream approach is its focus on the aggregate and little consideration is given for the individual actions and relative forces that play out in the economy while it’s true the government or the central bank can stimulate the economy into a growth trajectory the structure of the economy can end up being unstable as a result just consider the  financial crisis the us economy has been seemingly growing strong for years but this growth was later found to be pretty toxic and the whole financial system almost collapsed as a result and the solution was more of the same per the mainstream prescription more deficit spending lower interest rates and unprecedented monetary policies such as quantitative easingthe austrian school of economics focuses precisely on what the mainstream ignores relative price changes capital heterogeneity incentives in the private vs public sector the shifts in time preference via monetary policies if you’re struggling to understand what that means it can be simplified to one key idea individual human action everything that happens in the economy stems from the fact that individuals act the individual is motivated by subjective preferences and the incentives that people face economic policy can be viewed as an attempt to manipulate the incentive structure lower interest rates and people will be incentivized to go into debt and prefer consumption over investmentcontrary to mainstream economics the austrian school isn’t technocratic in nature the adherents of austrian economics understand that the economy is fundamentally unmanageable but the absence of conscious management doesn’t mean chaos ensues as hayek explains in one of the greatest economic articles of all time individual actions are coordinated via the price mechanism economy is a complex system in constant flux and the relevant data points about supply demand resource scarcity and individual preferences and neverending changes of these factors are dispersed among millions of minds to communicate each data point in its full form is impossible — instead the smallest viable information is communicated through price price is all the information that manufacturers merchants investors and consumers need to know to adjust their actions to better reflect realitybut when money itself is subject to central planning the price mechanism is polluted by a lot of noise for the price mechanism to broadcast pure economic signals and the economy to work properly money should be separated from the stateit’s important to underscore what money is money in the most fundamental sense is a societal institution — a set of rules and habits that ease the cooperation among people as nick szabo points out in shelling out the institution of money emerges everywhere we look over the course of history because it simply makes sense when the society reaches a sufficient division of labor money emerged from the need to store the value of one’s labor for later use and exchange the value with others both the store of value and means of exchange roles are crucial for money to fulfill its role in society and it’s no coincidence that bitcoin emerged and took off at the peak of a worldwide financial crisis when the store of value function in today’s money was sacrificed to keep the system togetherconclusioneverybody has a bias the author of these lines is biased toward nonstate solutions of society’s problems and this bias is only partially based on valuefree economic arguments political philosophy as well as selfinterest is natural for humans and we shouldn’t be afraid to admit that fiat mindset is a bias held by those facing lifelong incentives to uphold the status quothe idea of stripping human discretion from monetary policy is completely opposite to the way money operates today thats a major problem for mainstream economics which focuses on money as a shortterm enabler one which cant be saved only spent inevitably in favor of those who print itthat’s why mainstream economists will fight bitcoin until the bitter end of hyperbitcoinization bitcoin as an emergent money phenomenon is a slap in their face it has the potential to completely shatter the illusion of technocratic management when the state loses the ability to manage money the formula that has worked in the past decades falls apart no monetary inflation no cantillon effect no chronic public deficits no bailouts the house of cards falls down but don’t blame bitcoin for that the fiat system would crumble even if bitcoin never emerged because central planning always fails bitcoin can act as a lifeboat before the fiat collapse and as an instrument of recovery afterwardthis is a guest post by josef tětek opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of btc inc or bitcoin magazine
