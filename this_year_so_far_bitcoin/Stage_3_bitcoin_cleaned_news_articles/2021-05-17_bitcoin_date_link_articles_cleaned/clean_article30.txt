the spectacular surge in bitcoins price and the growing adoption by the mainstream financial industry including legacy establishments such as visa mastercard and bny mellon has had investors rushing to crypto exchanges to grab a piece of the digital currency actionwhile the stratospheric rise in bitcoin prices and wild media headlines have whipped up a fomo frenzy the fundamentals of investing haven’t changed the same investing rules and due diligence apply to bitcoin as any other asset classif anything a slew of factors makes bitcoin a far riskier investment than the traditional alternatives investors would do well to become familiar with some of the most significant issues in the wild and woolly world of cryptocurrencieshere are some key bitcoin risks to weigh whether you’re considering wading in for the first time or have already placed your bitcoin betsprice volatility riskthe price of bitcoin is prone to wild swings the market is extremely sensitive to news and new developments which causes frequent and volatile upswings and downdrafts in the digital currencys price “bitcoin is likely to remain very sensitive to shifts in global interest rates especially us interest rates as well as to the broader dollar exchange rate” arnab das global market strategist at invesco saysfurthermore bitcoin sees little use as its stated purpose – a transactional currency “the price volatility makes it harder to be used to buy and sell goods” kristoffer inton an equity analyst at morningstar says mr inton uses the example of the man who bought a couple of pizzas with  bitcoins in  “at today’s prices those pizzas cost him millions of dollars” he saysloss of demand riskas a relatively new product and technology bitcoin may be some way from widespread acceptance the demand and usage of bitcoin are beholden to the underlying technology that technology needs to first get to a place where it can be trusted by large riskaverse retail investors and other institutions new yorkbased financial analyst mitchell yousem says“right now real time technology and infrastructure is a bit lagging and there have been issues not even associated with crypto or btc” he says referring to instances when digital banks and trading platforms couldn’t handle incremental increases in transaction volumesthe lack of a major use other than investment further adds to the coin’s volatility “gold is an investment asset but it also has strong underlying demand in jewellery” mr inton says“if you invest in gold you know there’s going to be a buyer at some price  it’s hard to say the same thing about bitcoin since it’s not being used for anything else other than maybe nfts”on the other hand bitcoin is far too volatile to serve as a medium of exchange or a store of value to any meaningful degree thus it’s not used widely enough in exchanges mr das points outcyber security riskattacks from hackers have caused millions of dollars worth of losses in stolen digital tokens including bitcoin as events like mt gox revealed cyber security is a real risk associated with bitcointhe tokyobased bitcoin exchange was the target of a multimilliondollar theft that exposed the risk inherent in the unprotected digital wilderness “lots of coins were lost or stolen and there isn’t much an investor can do to rectify it” mr inton says “an asset built around anonymity like bitcoin makes it particularly attractive for cyber attacks”established payments systems and accounts benefit from extensive experience in avoiding attacks and fraud unlike these institutions “cyber warfare or cyber terrorism on the bitcoin network or other private cryptocurrency networks are a major risk” mr das saysregulatory riskincreased regulation of bitcoin could have implications for the future use of the digital currency “indeed some countries have already outlawed bitcoin notably china” mr das says india is in the process of restricting its use with some outright bans“restrictions in two of the world’s largest money systems in emerging markets along with restrictions in the world’s deepest financial systems in highincome economies is likely to prevent mainstream use of bitcoin to replace conventional moneys” mr das cautionsfrom mining to transfers and transactions cryptocurrencies are heavily reliant on internet connectivity reuterswestern economies are feeling their way to regulating bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as commodities or assets rather than money at present regulators in the us and canada treat bitcoin as a commodity while the european union russia and japan regard it as a currencyin fact some countries – namely russia and iran – are circumventing usimposed dollar financial sanctions by turning to bitcoin to avoid the dollar payments system the same goes for individuals seeking to avoid regulatory and tax nets of governments “these risks of bitcoin usage are probably a major reason why  subject to ‘knowyourclient’ or ‘antimoneylaundering’ rules are unlikely to accept bitcoin as freely as they do other forms of electronic funds transfer or payments” mr das saystransaction fees riskall bitcoin transactions must be verified by bitcoin miners who collect fees for each confirmation if miners can manage to collude and demand higher transaction fees they could dampen the attractiveness of the bitcoin network for users“the risk of untransparent pricing or other techniques is a risk in many types of asset markets and has also figured in transaction costs for many types of exchanges of money – for example retail crossborder transfers affecting remittances by migrant workers or simple touristretail foreign exchange transactions” mr das saysright now real time technology and infrastructure is a bit lagging and there have been issues not even associated with crypto or btc mitchell yousem financial analysta lack of competition lax or no regulation and a captive client base can conspire to be a real challenge “bitcoin users need to factor in these risks which have been realities for generations in other nonpoliced corners of the global financial system” he notesthe internet riskfrom mining to transfers and transactions cryptocurrencies are heavily reliant on internet connectivity both buyers and sellers of goods and services that trade using bitcoin access the digital currency blockchain via the internet the entire cryptocurrency system therefore is exclusively reliant on seamless internet connectivity“bitcoin shares the risk of exposure to the internet with virtually every other financial or payments system these days” mr das says however he stresses that while traditional systems can – and do – have an analogue backup bitcoin almost by definition cannot offer that securitythat users opt into that uncertainty armed with full or sufficient knowledge of the consequences of cyber terrorism is “presumably because they want other perceived benefits such as anonymity and a veil with the tax or other official authorities” mr das saysownership concentration riskapproximately  per cent of bitcoin is currently being held by  bitcoin wallets a large holder can have an outsized impact on the coin’s price this renders small investors vulnerable to wild price movements should one of these top holders decide to liquidate their position“this is a huge unknown” says mr yousem who works at a  billion longshort equity hedge fund in new york city “if a couple of those guys fully liquidated it would crash and fast – this is definitely a risk to consider”there’s also risk of general market manipulation in the absence of regulatory oversight there is no mechanism in place to “limit the activities of these big holders like there is in stocks or assets traded on regulated exchanged” mr inton saysto compound the issue it could all be owned by one person who has the ability to pull the trigger since one wallet does not necessarily mean one unique holder mr yousem says “this adds another layer of risk on btc but does not apply to all crypto currencies current and future” he saystransfer error riskbitcoin transfers are irreversible an erroneous transfer – whether accidental or resulting from a foul play – can cause a significant and irreversible loss there have been instances where a user accidentally transferred incorrect amounts or to an unintended recipient and was unable to recover the lost bitcointhe price volatility makes it harder to be used to buy and sell goods kristoffer inton equity analyst at morningstar“there are limitations and downsides to retail consumers” mr yousem says “if you wanted to scare those people away it’s definitely with the loss of private keys or unintentional transactions since there is no central authority”while there is transaction fee and execution risk associated with most securities mr yousem says it’s certainly a different beast with bitcoinloss of private keys riska user requires certain numerical codes known as private keys to access bitcoin the loss or destruction of these codes could prevent the owner from accessing their bitcoin many bitcoin owners were horrified to find the loss of these private keys could be irreversible and carry a substantial financial cost“bitcoin users are subject to a variety of specific risks that are more immediate and potentially with much greater downside including loss of private keys than conventional moneys” mr das saysarguably some bitcoin worshippers are aware of these risks but accept them in exchange for anonymity or avoidance of authorities “that said this aspect of bitcoin risk should be distinguished from the price volatility risk or potential for capital gains when used as a speculative investment vehicle as opposed to a transaction or payment vehicle” mr das adds
