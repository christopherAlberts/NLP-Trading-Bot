eye when someone hacked their coinbase accountcoinbase claims on its website to have  million customers and describes itself as the “world’s most trusted crypto exchange”but the vidovics say the

something called a “sim swap“i noticed that all of the sudden my phone stopped working the internet stopped working” tanja saidsomeone contacted tanja’s cell provider cricket wireless pretended to be her and had her sim card — containing her pictures contacts and apps — electronically transferred to a new phone“when they did the sim swap they switched over email addresses to make their email to be the backup and my phone number is now their phone number” tanja saidthat allowed the crooks to use twofactor verification to access her coinbase account“they were able to make these changes and transfer all of our money via this app over to their wallet in an instant” tanja said“and then eight hours later after you noticed it you notified coinbase and their response was none of the

cybercrimes“there is no fdic for the crypto world you’re on your own it’s still the wild wild west” dimitrelos said “this year i’ve done more cryptocurrency fraud investigations than all other years combined it’s because that’s where the money is today”dimitrelos says unlike banks and credit card companies cryptocurrency exchanges don’t yet have adequate policies to address fraudulent transactions“someone can steal your money without any recourse and if you can get law enforcement to help you all they can do is trace back these transactions to most likely foreign countries” dimitrelos saidhis client joe blumetti learned that the hard way“this is by far not only the most unsuspected thing that’s ever happened to me that i didn’t see coming but the worst” blumetti saidblumetti invested proceeds from the sale of his family’s beverage distribution business into cryptocurrency which was stolen last month“i’m still not back in my account so i cannot tell how bad the damage is but it’s in the hundreds of thousands” he saiddimitrelos says thieves used a hacked username and password from a security breach to enter blumetti’s email account and identify him as a crypto trader“they knew he had the account they knew what the username was they were able to log in but they still needed that challenge token in this case the pin” dimitrelos saidso they set up a fake website that looked like it was from coinbase and contacted him“what they told joe was hey we saw you had an error in a transaction you had about a month ago and they used that knowledge because they were in his email” dimitrelos said“the gentleman reached out to me through text and he called and he sent me a screen that showed the coinbase signin” blumetti saidthat’s what tricked him into sending him his verification code“when i finally opened my computer and used my twofactor on my computer all i saw was my account draining from its toplevel straight down” blumetti saidthe first transaction transferred more than  worth of bitcoin out of his accountblumetti immediately tried contacting coinbase“there is no person in their support team that will talk to you” blumetti saidadam walserhe eventually reached them by email and instructed the company to disable his accountover the past month joe says he sent coinbase multiple emails trying to get help and received only generic responses“no name no identification gus thinks we’re speaking to a robot” he saidhe’s also contacted his internet provider the police the us secret service and the fbi but has not been able to unwind the fraudulent transactionsyou can steal a million dollars instantaneouslyattorney david silver of coral springs florida represents  victims of crypto theft“one of the reasons hackers like cryptocurrency is you can steal a million dollars instantaneously” silver saidhe says phone companies and cryptocurrency exchanges rarely make victims whole“the phone company’s gonna say there’s an intervening third party criminal who’s responsible” silver saidthe vidavics and blumetti received messages from coinbase saying the company wasn’t responsible for their losses“unfortunately as you may already be aware all cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible once theyve been confirmed on their respective blockchain and the funds are not able to be recovered by coinbase” one email said“it’s time for regulation they are a trillion dollar market and they need regulation” silver said“you steal someone’s gold and diamonds and if it’s found they go to jail and you go home with your stuff why is it that cryptocurrency today’s number one growing asset can be stolen found and cannot be recouped” blumetti said“how are they getting away with this tanja vidovic said hundreds of thousands of
