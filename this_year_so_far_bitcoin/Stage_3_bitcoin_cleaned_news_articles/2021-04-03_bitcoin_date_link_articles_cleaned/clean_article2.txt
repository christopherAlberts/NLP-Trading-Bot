 is a crucial year for bitcoin and by extension for the larger cryptocurrency market while bitcoin has come a long way in terms of adoption the bull run of  has seen two very crucial events affect bitcoin’s investor basethe first was a hike in institutional investments with the surge in interest coming from traditional and institutional circles following the same bitcoin’s price was quick to respond too the year also saw another interesting development which included the traditional market and btc’s relationship with the sp  with gold seeming to have undergone its very own evolution over the past few monthswith the first quarter of  coming to a close bitcoin’s price and its performances as a store of value asset are extremely positive and continue to fuel a spike in institutional and retail investors this despite the high valuation bitcoin currently enjoys with the crypto trading close to  at the time of writingin fact according to market data this is the best  in the last  years from a price valuation standpoint and the same has allowed the coin to register  gains according to data provided by arcane research over the same timeframe two developments spurred the price of btc – the first was tesla’s investment in btc and the second involved bny mellon announcing integrated services for btc and other cryptoassetsinterestingly over the same timeframe bitcoin has also seen its futures open interest levels hit alltime highs this according to data provided by coinmetrics has been a doubleedged sword that in turn enabled longterm growth for the asset the report pointed out“with new money pouring into the market btc futures open interest levels hit alltime highs preceding both major selloffs although painful in the shortterm these selloffs helped close out some overleveraged positions clearing the path for further growth”in addition to this the cryptocurrency has been able to maintain a positive price trend over the past three months in fact bitcoin’s close competitors in the traditional finance market seemed to have tweaked their relationship with the king coinwhile  was not the norm thanks to the unprecedented macroeconomic conditions bitcoin maintained a high correlation with asset classes like the sp however  saw the trend reverse itself and btc now enjoys a lot more independence thanks to the low correlation with the sp – taking correlation levels back to what is considered the normal rangethis change in the relationship was also evident if one were to take a look at the btcgold correlation as a store of value and a longterm asset btc’s closest competitors continue to be monetary metals like gold and coinmetrics’s data seemed to suggest that the change in btc’s correlation with gold has had ‘an even steeper decline although it rebounded a bit in march’this has led to btc eating into gold’s market share with the “bitcoin is digital gold” narrative gaining momentumin the coming months and remaining threequarters of  one could see bitcoin’s correlation fall even further when it comes to traditional assets this is likely to push institutional investor confidence primarily because of the autonomy the btc market has enjoyed in comparison to other assets further price prediction models’ projected values may soon materialize as the coin finds adequate momentum to break past its established ath of around
