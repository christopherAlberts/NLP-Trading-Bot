yahoo finance’s myles udland and brian sozzi breakdown bitcoin’s decline and the extended ark etf slump as stock futures are down ahead of fed chair jerome powell’s testimony to congressvideo transcriptmyles udland big story in the market yesterday is whats happening over with cathie woods ark invest they have a suite of etfs five etfs trading with various arkk is the main fund but theyve got arkw arkf arkg and arkq as well all those funds losing about  and  during yesterdays trading session there is a bitcoin position within the ark portfolio they also have a lot of the major tech names that have been such big winnersand the story of cathie woods success over the last couple of years destroying the market on a returns basis seeing aum go from about  billion to about  billion in just a handful of years just a major player within the market brian sozzi but i think its just interesting to see the action yesterday and well see how much follow through there is into a number of those ark names that people are now associating those funds with getting specific pressure and i think the most the clearest reason perhaps to say what was hurting tech stocks yesterdaybrian sozzi yeah myles let me pick up on that point ark because im looking at right now a chart out of jefferies and they noted last week the six ark etfs that they track pulled in a cool  billion and those six etfs jefferies tracks year to date before this rout they saw inflows of  billion year to date so ark invest cathie wood weve covered her extensively really before anyone even knew who she was has really gained a lot of attention on wall street with individual investors for her performance mainly around tesla and a lot of these next generation investmentsbut myles to the selloff today it really is interesting and you have i think the establishment now coming out here and trying to pop the bubble in bitcoin and sure i know elon musk came out over the weekend he said quote bitcoin prices seem too high but you had janet yellen come out yesterday at an event questioned the efficiency of using bitcoin you have bill gates questioning the very existence of bitcoin unsurprisingstory continuesbut again these are the types of comments when you have a lot of momentum trades and you have a momentum type investment like a bitcoin these are type of comments that could actually pop the bubble and thats what were seeing i think here this morning and its not just tesla getting under pressure or bitcoin under pressure its a lot of these other plays nvidia under pressure their technology gets used to mine bitcoin microstrategy under pressure myles how is their new convertible debt raise looking given the rout right now looks absolutely absurdmyles udland yeah and i think its interesting sozzi because were talking about bitcoin at  it was a month ago that bitcoin had just broken  we came into   its not  anymore we came into  with bitcoin closer to  we got above those record levels from  that was the big event so we have seen the price move considerably just in a couple of weeks hereand as we have discussed many times the story with bitcoin is the price i know that bill gates can say whatever and janet yellen can say whatever and no one in the coin community likes those comments much and i dont blame them because the story with all of these assets is that the price goes up a lot and that brings more interest into the space it creates situations like whats happening over at microstrategy it gets someone like elon musk interested in putting a billion and a half dollars into bitcoin and the interest is driven by how expensive one bitcoin isobviously at  theres a lot of people who have made a ton of money and they dont really care that its off  today and theyre not going to care for another  if even then they get interested in being worried about their holdings and so i think it is an interesting situation soz when you compare it to lets say apple goes down  in one day everyone was freaking out theres got to be a reason why that happens its more difficult with the establishment to talk about bitcoin because there doesnt have to be a reason necessarily that it goes up or down as much as it tends to and it creates a very odd asset to discussbrian sozzi no youre right on myles and i do want to leave folks with maybe some positive news this morning because really theyre seeing a route in nasdaq shares youve seen the market under pressure i would say for seven straight days this comes at a evercore isi this morning dennis debusschere notes quote market internals are consistent with our view that market return skew is deteriorating as real rates increase but the average stock will be fine and cyclicals leadhe notes that the sp  yes on a multiday losing streak but cyclicals have outperformed defensives by  over the past five days so while youre seeing this concentrated pressure in nasdaq and bitcoin and some of these hot money assets at least for right now youre perhaps not seeing something that would suggest a bigger selloff or correction might be in the cards soonmyles udland yeah and it goes back to a theme i know well discuss as we get through the balance of this year which is really can the economy and can a lot of stocks within the market do quite well even as the sp and the tech stocks those high flying names are under pressure i think the old thing is whats bad for the fang names is probably good for you and i hoping to get back to real life so interesting comments dennis there and well see how that theme plays out through the rest of the year
