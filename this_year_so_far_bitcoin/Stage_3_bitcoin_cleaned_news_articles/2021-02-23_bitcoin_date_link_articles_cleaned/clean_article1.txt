over the past  hours meeting the commonly used definition for a bear marketto be sure bitcoin’s wobbles aren’t unusual but the crypto’s reputation for volatility is one reason naysayers contend it isn’t suited to serve as a medium of exchangewhy is bitcoin’s price downindeed that was a point raised by treasury secretary janet yellen on monday during a new york times dealbook conference“to the extent it is used i fear it’s often for illicit finance it’s an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions and the amount of energy that’s consumed in processing those transactions is staggering” the former fed chairwoman saidyellen’s comments have been cited as a reason for bitcoin’s recent losses however yellen’s assessment of bitcoin as a inefficient medium of exchange is an important point and one that has already been raised in the past by bitcoin bullsusing a volatile asset in exchange for goods and services makes little sense if the asset can tumble  in a day or surge  over the course of a two months as bitcoin has done in  critics argueto put a finer point on it over the past  months bitcoin has registered  corrections defined as a decline from a recent peak of at least  but not more than  and two bear markets which are defined as falls of  or more according to dow jones market databy comparison the sp  index spx  and the dow jones industrial average djia  have had one correction that then fell further into a bear market over the past year and gold    considered one of bitcoin’s rivals as a store of value has had two corrections including its current one but has avoided slipping into a bear market over the past yearsome have also attributed bitcoin’s recent retrenchment to comments from newfound crypto enthusiast elon musk the chief executive of

cryptos are purely speculative assets that could be regulated out of existence knocking their price to zeroit is just not clear what the future holds for cryptos or if bitcoin specifically will emerge as the dominant virtual asset to rule them allalthough yellen’s comments were credited with bringing down the price of bitcoin and its rivals the treasury secretary’s remarks could be ultimately viewed as constructive for digital assets in generalshe also said during her interview with the times that digital payments which the fed and other central banks across the globe have explored could lead to “faster safer and cheaper payments” which she described as important goalsthat is hardly a knock on bitcoin but it isn’t a fullthroated endorsement of the cryptocurrency or other cryptos since

characterized the bitcoin pullback as a bit of hiccup and said he wouldn’t surprised to see it retake  at some point but notes that it had been overbought and was vulnerable to a downturnread bitcoin drops further below key  level after yellen calls it ‘extremely inefficient’“bitcoin fever hasn’t gone away all of a sudden because musk has questioned the price but his twitter feed has certainly become a primary catalyst for the market” erlam wrote “that probably won’t stop it surging back above  in the very near future and probably hitting new highs shortly after”he speculated that bitcoin could hit  or  before it stabilizesin any case it is worth recalling that bitcoin enjoyed a parabolic surge back in december  nearing  before it crashed early in the following year to a low of that
