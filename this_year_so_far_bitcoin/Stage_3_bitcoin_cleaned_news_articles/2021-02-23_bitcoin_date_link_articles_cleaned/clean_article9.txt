the price of bitcoinever since i started writing articles about bitcoin for cityam the price of bitcoin has gone up over  exactly as expected however over the past  hours the price of bitcoin has retraced  there are a few reasons for this and i will detail them in this article i will also detail what i expect is the net result of all of this recent news and let you know what i think is coming next for bitcoin and cryptocurrenciesso kicking things off we have a  drop in  hours on the surface not a good thing at all in normal markets you would put this down to a sudden loss of confidence but in crypto things are a little different there are people that bought bitcoin for  and they are still holding there are people that have huge mining farms that have to sell large quantities to fund operations a combination of these  things is what makes bitcoin insanely volatileas the world slowly adopts bitcoin the amount of individuals holding large amounts of bitcoin reduces as they sell to take perceived profit into fiat currency or perhaps they realise their profit in a different cryptocurrency when these large holding individuals sell bitcoin it can trigger a loss of confidence among the community so you end up with a cascading selloff however that is not what happened here pool sells outin the case of why bitcoin fell  this can be put down to two primary reasons  bitcoin mining pool sent  bitcoin in a single transaction out of their bitcoin mining wallet and right onto the exchanges they then proceeded to dump all of this bitcoin in a very short period of time it is unknown if  were also shorting bitcoin to capitalise on the price falling as the price of bitcoin fell there are so many new people in the market and new money is easily panicked so they then start selling for a loss and so you end up with huge amounts of bitcoin flooding towards exchanges this then snowballs into a catastrophic market move triggered by just one bitcoin minerso if bitcoin cant cope with one small group of individuals selling is it any good well the simple answer is bitcoin is small it is not very liquid compared to institutional markets because bitcoin is not a share in an asset bitcoin is the asset it’s kind of like if a property developer listed  properties for sale you would expect prices to come down until demand reaches supply and because a lot of bitcoins are in the hands of people not institutions the markets tend to be rather irrational it is not a problem at all because in the long term as bitcoin grows these large holders redistribute their wealth or become more professional in their operation and over the span of  years the market will even out bitcoin will stabilise much like gold has after it rallied for  years barely pausing to take a breaththe theorythe story of  dumping might not be one however of unsophisticated investors selling bitcoin to pay their bills i believe it is more likely that  have been dumping bitcoin in order to stop the price of bitcoin going euphoric and ending the bullrun every time bitcoin has turned euphoric on the nupl net unrealised profit  loss indicator a bear market has followed shortly after so this is something to consider the recent drop in bitcoin price may actually be intended to delay market euphoria and extend the bullrunthis theory actually lines up very well with what is going on in the market because on the cards at the moment michael saylor is about to buy  billion of bitcoin over the next few days of course if he were to buy when bitcoin was peaking at  then he would send the bull market into a euphoria but with  crushing the spirit of crypto investors his buy order will be easy to fill and when he sends out confirmation of its completion investors in crypto have historically reacted very positively to such newstether and the new york attorney generalthe final thing worth mentioning today would be the news coming from the new york attorney general nyag the nyag has suspended any further proceedings on tether and forced tether to pay an  fine while banning them from new york the reputation of tether is something that has been called into question many times and yet again under scrutiny they passed and did not get found guilty of anything this is amazing news for bitcoin because it means that all tether in circulation at the moment can be considered equal to the dollar and thus by extension it solidifies bitcoin’s price meaning there will be no rush to exit all crypto should tether collapsea combination of all of these factors i believe is occurring and i believe the next move for bitcoin will be a small period of consolidation followed by micheal saylor triggering the next round of institutional investment into bitcoin i expect bitcoin to hit  in  i don’t expect it to get there in a straight line but i expect it will get there and all of the things happening at the moment seem to be lining up to create the perfect stormtmg ‘that martini guy’ is a
