kitco news the financial market has enough demand to sustain both gold and bitcoin as safehaven assets according to digix cofounder and coo shaun djiegold and bitcoin will outperform a lot of asset classes this year djie told kitco news noting surging demand for inflationhedge assets amid massive money printing and currency debasement fearsand even though the gold space has been quiet this past few months especially when compared to bitcoin djie sees the precious metal climbing back up to  an ounce by the end of the year i wont be surprised to see bitcoin trading at  by the end of the year for gold i wouldnt be surprised to see it close to  level again he saidthe reason for his optimism is uncertainty which is still very much in the air djie warned that the pandemic would not be over this yearwe are unlikely to see everyone in the world vaccinated and borders reopen for tourism this year this means that more uncertainty is still ahead he said i would not be surprised to see a severe market correction toward the end of the year complete economic recovery will take longer than four yearsthis is at a time when the stock market is already overvalued and has a new wave of retail investors piling money into equities in search of better profit than their savings accountall the excess liquidity out there has been flowing to highly speculative assets the stock market is overvalued today we are seeing new alltime highs almost every other week he added people are finding the idea of investing a much less daunting one than two years ago in light of the social media and all the commentary out therebitcoin will not displace goldgold and bitcoin can both rise as investors seek better stores of value i dont think one is meant to displace the other gold has been around for a lot longer and the physical aspect of it would still be key and attractive to investors out there djie saidbitcoin attracts a different kind of investor than gold — the new digital crowd looking for safety he describedthe crypto world appeals to the people who have accelerated digital learning over the past  months since the covid pandemic started more people started to get involved in the stock market via their mobile phones the whole wave of selfeducation has proliferated the understanding of bitcoin and people are buying bitcoin on their own as a store of value djie explainedthis does not impact gold which will continue to provide an attraction the market is sufficient enough to contain both asset classes one would appeal to more to the digital crowd and the other more to the physical crowd he saidone more thing to consider in the gold versus bitcoin debate is all the regulation hints coming from us officials djie added gold will see a lot more action as regulators and different investors chime in on the narrative bitcoin gold will likely resume its old status as being safehaven and a riskfree asset he saidthe most recent comment was made by us treasury secretary janet yellen saying that bitcoin is an extremely inefficient way to conduct monetary transactionsi dont think that bitcoin … is widely used as a transaction mechanism yellen told cnbc to the extent it is used i fear its often for illicit finance its an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions and the amount of energy thats consumed in processing those transactions is staggeringdjie partly agreed with yellen stating that bitcoin is not very efficient when it comes to transactions but noted that the cryptos transaction efficiency is not why people have jumped aboard the crypto trainit is inefficient in normal transactions but the narrative of bitcoin today is more as a store of value and not so much as a means of payment or transactions that happen on a peertopeer basis he saidcompanies like tesla microstrategy and square have all been buying bitcoin citing its potential as a store of value djie noted i dont think anyone out there will like to use it on a daytoday basis for transactions it is slow volatile and expensive to usegolds resurgenceas it becomes clear that the economy is bound to face more problems in  including inflation gold will begin to trade higher and regain its status as the safehaven asset according to djiesince the start of the year the buying in gold has not been impressive as people were looking for better yields in other types of assets such as equities and the crypto market gold has always been seen as a riskoff asset but the market has been trading in a riskon mood this year he said going forward when the market realizes that investors should be picking gold over other assets youll see prices trending upwardsinvestors will not be able to ignore the warning signs for too long — inflation moneyprinting a lower dollar low interest rates and overvalued stock marketthere is a lot of commentaries rightly pointing out that the stock markets performance does not rightly mirror the health of the economy the stock market is near an alltime high and yet we do not see the corresponding economic recovery djie noted plus the us dollar will likely trade much lower against its peers while iinterest rates remain very lowinflation usually shows up a lot slower than other economic indicators but once it arrives investors should brace for an inflationary period over the next  monthsinflation is bound to happen because every country out there is funding its own stimulus programs and given the likelihood of more us dollars being printed i would not be surprised to see much higher inflation towards the end of the year he said bitcoin will perform in tandem with goldone more risk to watch in the longerterm is us president joe bidens stance on chinawe are likely see a pivotal power shift in the next four years when it comes to the trade war tensions between china and the us and it will cause gold to trade upwards djie stated
