yesterday i highlighted the broad market cycles and what technical analysts call the “excess phase top” process which usually takes place after the markets peak and setup a downward price trend there are a number of technical setups that take place throughout this process today i will be exploring the charts of tesla tsla apple aapl and bitcoin btc to see where they are in the processthe suggestion i am making by highlighting these market trends and setups is that a cash position is a viable allocation of capital away from risks and losses many traders don’t view a cash position as a properly allocated use of capital we believe taking a cash position at the right times can and does provide very clear benefits includingeliminating risks of further lossesdrawdowns setting up a process of protecting cash and waiting for a confirmed reentry trigger avoiding the failure of buying into a declining market – which is one of the biggest faults of active traders using the cash position as a hedge against shifting currencymarket valuationsremember in many cases broad market downtrends are often associated with bigger trends in currencies and global market sectors chasing these trends can lead to further risks if you are not careful and skilled in your trading decisions keeping your capital in a cash allocationposition is often the easiest and safest way for you to ride out volatile downside price trends and allows you to redeploy your cash into new trades when the time is rightunderstanding broad market cycles  trendsbefore we get started we are going to share the broader market cycles chart with you to refresh your memory or if you missed the first part of this research articlebefore looking at the charts please bear in mind that these patterns often take place over many months usually the initial topping  phase and flagging formation  take place over a  to  day span of time yes sometimes these setups can take place over shorter spans of time but usually they last over  daysstory continuesadditionally the breakdown of the flag formation  which leads to the setup of intermediate support  can often take many months to complete as well my research team and i have seen the flagging setup last well over  days at times and after the immediate support level is reached markets sometimes attempt to move sideways for many weeksmonths before attempting to break below that support levelappl continues to flag out – watch for potential breakdown below the weekly aapl chart below highlights the rally from  to over  over the past  years notice the price split that happened in  this rally reached a peak near january    and has fallen nearly  from the peak levels before starting a sideways flag formation  this type of setup completes the first two processes of the excess phase top setup and aligns with the broader market cycles to suggest we may have entered the “complacency” phase of price trendingthe sideways flagging pattern  on this chart suggests aapl may continue to move within this price channel before attempting to either recover by moving to new highs or to break below the  level  which would confirm the next phase of the excess phase top patternif we see any continued breakdown in price traders need to prepare for the markets to attempt to move downward targeting historical support levels where we expect price to consolidate for many weeksmonths i have drawn a yellow line near a very clear support level for aapl near  as a potential downside price target if this excess phase top pattern fails we will likely see aapl rally back above  and attempt to break into a new bullish trending phasetesla breaks below flag channels – what’s nextthe following weekly tsla chart highlights the rally from  to over  over the past year note the price split that happened in  this rally also reached a peak near january    and has fallen nearly  from the peak levels before starting a sideways flag formation  at this phase of price action we can see tsla has recently broken below the lower flag price channel and may be attempting to start a downward price trend where price will seek out intermediate supporti have drawn a yellow line near a very clear support level for tsla near  as a potential downside price target for this next phase of the excess phase top pattern  from a technical standpoint if the support level near recent lows near  holds and price is unable to move below this level then we may see a technical failure of the excess phase top patternthe move to the intermediate support level which must be lower than the lows of the flag formation is critical in confirming the move into “complacency” and the transition into “anxiety” on the broad market cycle example without this subsequent breakdown in price happening we would consider the excess phase top pattern potentially invalid or failed and start to watch for any new upside price trending – eventually targeting recent highs near  at this point the  lows have become the new critical price level for tsla and we are expecting price to continue to move lower possibly breaching the  levelbitcoin gaps lower after peak  breaks flag lows – what’s nextthis last chart for daily btc futures highlights the rally from  to over  over the past  months this rally reached a peak near april    and gapped lower on april   the recent downside price move from that peak totaled nearly  before starting a sideways flag formation  in order to confirm the next phase of this excess phase top pattern we would watch for price to break lower breaking the flag formation channels and attempt to break below the recent support level near  if we see a strong breakdown in price where closing price levels break below  i would expect price to move quickly below  and attempt to seek out critical supporti have drawn a yellow line near a very clear support level for btc near  as a potential downside price target for this next phase of the excess phase top pattern recently bitcoin broke below the flag formation lower channel and briefly traded below support near  if we continue to see downward price trending where price closes below this level i would consider this technical confirmation of the excess phase top pattern suggesting price will attempt to continue moving lower while trying to seek out intermediate support near the yellow line possiblyat this point bitcoin is showing moderate weakness and has already attempted to break recent support any confirmation of further downward trending could push us out of the complacency phase and into the anxiety phase of the broad market cycles are you ready for what’s nextthe question of “should you be in cash” right now is a very valid concern for many tradersinvestors learning how to
