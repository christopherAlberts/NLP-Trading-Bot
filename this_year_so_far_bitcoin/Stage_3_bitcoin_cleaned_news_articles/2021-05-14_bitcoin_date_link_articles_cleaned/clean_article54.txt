its  bitcoin investment on  february it sparked an eyepopping  gain that day to close right above  though elon noted that tesla will not be selling any bitcoin this development does not bode well for the narrative of increasing private sector adoption not to mention after more criticism from sec chair gary gensler during a congressional testimony who said the “odds we’ll see a bitcoin etf approved

policy sooner than rather than later invalidating technical resistance posed by the  level could be telling though this may weigh negatively on speculative assets like stocks and crypto it would likely coincide with a stronger us dollar as highlighted by the generally positive correlation between the dxy index and tenyear treasury yieldsconversely softer treasury yields would likely suggest that the fed is doing its job keeping long term inflation expectations anchored and markets buying into the transitory narrative this is why fintwit traders might want to consider keeping the direction of treasury yields and the us dollar toward the top of their radars for potential bellwethers to where markets might head next written by rich dvorak analyst for dailyfxcomconnect with
