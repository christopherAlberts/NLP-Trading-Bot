ross gerber gerber kawasaki wealth  investment management ceo joins yahoo finance live to break down coinbase’s first earnings report as a public company assess what’s next for crypto and discuss the future of automaker teslavideo transcriptzack guzman coinbase reporting earnings during what has possibly been if not ever the most interesting week for crypto this year at least the very least in  after elon musk opened pandoras box by highlighting bitcoins sustainability concerns and pulling a  on tesla accepting the crypto for transactions that obviously didnt impact coinbases first quarter results which are mostly prereported as it moved forward with its direct listing earlier in the yearbut yesterday made the numbers official the largest exchange here final numbers came in mostly in line with expectations this weeks volatility prompted a reminder even from coinbase that this business is inherently volatile and on the earnings call ceo brian armstrong also said that it will be listing dogecoin in six to eight weeks and elon musk also tweeted hes in touch with dogecoin devs to work on efficiencies when it comes to that blockchain a very interesting time for coinbase reportingbut here for more on that want to welcome back into the show ross gerber gerber kawasaki wealth investment management ceo with us again and ross i know youve gotten pretty active in the crypto space obviously you rode tesla for years you rode that wave higher but does it feel like you got your two kids turning on each other when youre looking at elon taking on bitcoin here talking about your take here as it looks like the kids are fightingross gerber well i think elon is wading into an area thats maybe not the best set of statements to make because the fact of the matter is bitcoin is the future of digital currencies its the root of it and i think theres a reason to address the energy use and its certainly to teslas benefit for bitcoin miners to use solar power for example but many bitcoin miners already are using renewable energystory continuesfrom the beginning they knew that this was going to be a big expense for them so theyve been very smart in building their networks around areas with very low costs and mostly renewable energyso i think this whole dogecoin thing is a big distraction for tesla and elon and i dont really get it other than its a byproduct of teslas success elon starts doing stuff to piss people off and thats what he does but i ignore all that noise im an investor and if you want to play that game you can but whateverakiko fujita ross what do you think that announcement really was about when were talking about tesla saying theyre no longer going to accept bitcoin i mean im not sure anybody really believes that this is a sudden revelation about the climate impactross gerber rightakiko fujita is there a larger issue you think behind the scenes about maybe there wasnt as widespread adoption as he had anticipated or the volatility thats attached to bitcoin what do you think this was really aboutross gerber well i think the truth is nobodys using bitcoin to buy anything because it keeps going up i mean you dont use a bitcoin to buy something because it keeps going up so like you would use a dollar to buy a car thats a depreciating asset in theoryso i think its just marketing to say that you take bitcoin i dont think people are buying stuff with bitcoin obviously if i bought a lot of dogecoin at like a half a cent and now its at  i would probably buy a tesla immediately with dogecoinso theres no value in dogecoin so if you can get value out of it today i think that thats a great thing but i think its a very dangerous area for elon to get in when hes causing people losses like he did the other day and it turns people against him and ultimately tesla and i think thats what kind of hit teslas stock a little bit the other daybut that being said cryptocurrencies are here to stay he is an innovator he created paypal he was one of the creators and so this is an area he actually does have an expertise in and i personally wish he would focus on making evs because im still waiting for my tesla model s plaid and thats all that i care about to be honestzack guzman interestingly as weve been talking on the show there are more guzmans now the extended family here in my own lineage dipping a toe into tesla here with some purchases so intriguing but ross when we dig into the dogecoin thing i think that that one i called coinbase adding it to the platform that one it seems like really elon musk on twitter is positioning tesla to be accepting that i dont know if thats whats going to come from this but it seems like that way as you point out kind of a depreciating assetwhen we look at some of the other earnings updates we got though of course i have to ask you about disney since you won our stock madness tournament with the pick on disney we got the update there and earnings mostly coming in line but investors focusing on the miss when it comes to disney subscriber numbers  million versus the  million expectedtalk about the thesis around disney now as it kind of pulls back today and what you made of the earningsross gerber well its a buying opportunity for longterm investors i mean anybody whos focused on disney instead of whats actually happening to disney the company is missing the whole boat i mean disney is at  millionplus subscribers this is way ahead of anybodys expectation because of the pandemicand now were getting the benefit of the parks opening and masks are now being mask requirements are being removed weve already seen this in vegas mask requirements are already removed i think were going to see this in the theme parkstheres no reason i was at a live event this week theres no reason that these places cant be  full or greater its perfectly safe californias being overly protective of our success which im all for but its time to accept that weve been successful with it and open up disneyland fullyso disney is about to embark on a very very profitable future over the next several years for a longterm investor this is a great opportunity for a stock like disneyakiko fujita does the base case for disney shift now that youve got the parks back in play if you think about how far disney has gone over the last year its all been trading on the streaming side how do you think investors should be thinking about the stock nowross gerber well youve got lets say  million subscribers and if you look at netflix theyve got  million so if you just do a  times multiple of their revenue its  billion on the streaming annualized so youve got a  billion valuation in disney based off what i consider reasonable metricsand then youve got this wonderful business thats been shut down called theaters cruises hotels the plays the theme parks these are cash cows for disney and theyve been completely shutnow imagine whats going to happen over the next two years as all this reopens and really by summer  all of this hitting full stride so if youre once again a longterm investor and you see a pullback like this in disney its a great opportunity to buy because theyre going to have the streaming business on the other end which is obviously going to slow now but theyre going to have all these other really cash flowpositive businesses coming online now and earnings were above expectations on top of thatzack guzman no thats a fair point earnings were the standout there in that report top line less so ross gerber gerber kawasaki wealth and investment management ceo always love having you back on be well have a great weekend
