low energy proofofwork bitcoin improvement proposal wants to change networks algorithmthe most topical conversation in the world of cryptocurrencies right now is the effects of bitcoin mining on the global environment after elon musk heated up the conversation following the recent tesla announcement the cofounder of siphox and powx michael dubrovsky revealed the nonprofit powx has recently submitted a bitcoin improvement proposal bip that aims to produce a “durable low energy” bitcoin proofofwork pow systema low energy pow proposal submitted to the bitcoin developer’s mailing listthis week tesla’s elon musk ignited the conversation surrounding bitcoin mining and the effects on the global environment musk’s company also said that it was choosing not to accept bitcoin btc for electric car purchases following the statements from tesla the fintech payments firm square told the public it would not purchase bitcoin going forward and also cited environmental concernsthen musk tweeted that he truly cared about the crypto ecosystem and said “to be clear i strongly believe in crypto but it can’t drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use especially coal” although this tweet was followed by responses showing a tesla car being charged by electricity which obtained power from coal in north dakotameanwhile a great number of developers from alternative blockchains that utilize little to no energy to secure and confirm transactions shilled their projects programmers behind proofofstake pos projects and other types of blockchains that are less energyintensivebut after musk tweeted about his concerns about coal he also said he was working with the developers behind the dogecoin network “working with doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency potentially promising” he said on fridayon the same day michael dubrovsky cofounder of the nonprofit powx tweeted that his team submitted a lowenergy pow proposal to the bitcoin developer’s mailing list“we at powxorg have had a draft of a bitcoin improvement proposal— durable low energy bitcoin pow—for a while now” dubrovsky remarked on twitter “looks like the energy issue is finally getting some attention bitcoin can be made compatible  lowenergy optical compute” the powx cofounder addedheavyhash bitcoin mining and photonicsbitcoincom news has reported on the powx project before back when michael dubrovsky marshall ball and bogdan penkovsky published a paper that described a “novel pow algorithm” the researcher’s paper details how the algorithm dubbed “optical proofofwork opow” could annihilate energy dependency by leveraging photonics the project’s website says powx is a nonprofit “dedicated to developing pow cryptography compatible with ultraenergyefficient optical computing” in powx’s bip summary the developers’ notefrom a practical perspective bitcoin adoption by companies like tesla which recently rescinded its acceptance of bitcoin as payment has been hampered by its massive energy consumption and perceived environmental impactthe team has developed a cryptographic algorithm called “heavyhash” which would take the place of bitcoin’s  algorithm the bip summary written by powx further says that the algorithm heavyhash is compatible with “ultraenergyefficient photonic coprocessors” the products are specifically developed for machine learning powx’s proposal details“heavyhash uses a proven digital hash  packaged with a large amount of mac multiplyandaccumulate computation into a proofofwork puzzle” the proposal adds “although heavyhash can be computed on any standard digital hardware it becomes hardware efficient only when a small digital core is combined with a lowpower photonic coprocessor for performing mac operations” likewise the opow mining rigs would be equipped with a “small digital core flipchipped onto a large lowpower photonic chip”the solution dubrovsky and the powx team created has been discussed in the past and so far it hasn’t gained much traction further not everyone agreed with dubrovsky’s recent tweet and one individual said “wasting chips is also bad for the environment” however bogdan penkovsky a “researcher in braininspiredneuromorphic computing” disagreed with the individual’s wasting chips response“accelerating development of lowenergy computing can be hardly called a waste” penkovsky replied “this technology has potential to drastically reduce data centers energy use in the future” the researcher who coauthored the “optical proofofwork” paper addedwhat do you think about the powx project and
