by the ershares teamershares’s proprietary methodology the entrepreneur factor has embedded esg factors since its inception esg is an integral part of the ershares investment philosophy and therefore the firm rarely faces a tradeoff between investment opportunities and esg policy compliance along the investment processthe firm positions itself as a thought leader and has taken measurable actions to encourage companies they invest in to consider esg angles they realize that beyond the encouragement of particular esg initiatives to the preceding companies it is far more critical and impactful to bring awareness of the esg issues at handbitcoin’s energy consumption and environmental impact now have extremely significant unintended consequences than mainstream stories suggest therefore the ershares team has worked to frame the issue and stand against bitcoin as it uses a considerable amount of energy the proportion of renewable energy utilized remains unclear and regulations regarding cryptocurrency overall remain nebulousbitcoin mining electricity usage emissions too highblockchain technology although an incredible technological advancement has astonishing and evident environmental footprintsthe energy consumption is rooted in the “crypto mining” that makes digital currencies energyintensive as they are researchers estimate that “mining bitcoin the most popular blockchainbased currency uses more electricity than entire countries like argentina” ny timesalthough it makes up a small portion of the world’s total transactions the carbon footprint involved compares to entire nations’ carbon footprints bitcoin energy emissions alone can further exacerbate global warming well beyond levels that can potentially lead to even more detrimental effects of climate changegradually the cryptocurrencies’ environmental impact is starting to vex climate policy “if left unchecked bitcoin mining in china— where an estimated twothirds of the world’s blockchain mining takes place—could make it difficult for the world’s largest polluter to meet its climate goals china’s inner mongolia region said recently that it was moving to ban the practice because it was hampering the province’s efforts to meet the new carbonemissions goals set by the national government” ny times hence governments worldwide are beginning to crack down on crypto mining and lock in new climate change policiesershares’s stance on bitcoinershares has set its own standards by upholding a clear policy not to invest in bitcoin for this very reason in extension to this most of their employees have adopted this policy in their personal portfolios for the same reasonthe ershares team also spreads awareness to the public through their media streams for instance coinbase coin made history as the first major cryptocurrency company to list its shares on a stock exchange in the united states pushing its valuation close to  billion ny times although this was hailed as a landmark moment for global digital currencies the firm has also addressed the stock’s negative impact on the environmental and regulatory issues on the rise since its recent debutwithin the financial industry digital currency’s energy consumption can be overlooked as trivial compared to the implications of traditional banking therefore ershares works to ensure that investors are more conscious of the bitcoin system and its indirect effect on esgthere are efforts to make cryptocurrency technology more environmentally sustainable still until they are enacted ershares will continue to oppose bitcoin and bring awareness as a thought leader within the global financial industryentrepreneurs “conscious of longterm consequences”behind the companies ershares invests in are entrepreneurs who work as thought leaders much aligned to the investment manager’s own team culture these companies are created by entrepreneurs who identified pain points in their personal lives and continue to develop new solutions ershares’s academic research also goes back twenty years and demonstrates the consistent outperformance of competition due to entrepreneurs creating a unique culture overall they are conscious of longterm consequences and harness their resources in a productive and allocative mannerbeyond the fundamental issue of bitcoin entrepreneurs think about innovation differently and consider the potential negative implications of the innovation disruption thus ershares firmly believes that the companies they invest in and present to their investors as opportunities work to incorporate the same level of awareness within their organizations as the team does internally at ersharesershares is an investment management firm that focuses on entrepreneurial stocks their
