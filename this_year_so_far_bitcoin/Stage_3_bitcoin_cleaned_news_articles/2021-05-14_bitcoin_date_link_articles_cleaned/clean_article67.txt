if you bought bitcoin or another cryptocurrency in the last few months chances are your portfolio has seen both pain and joy in equal measure we saw that yesterday when bitcoin tanked after tesla’s elon musk said the company would no longer allow its cars to be bought with bitcoinbut crypto portfolios could face a much bigger threat in coming weeks the capital gains taxes announced in us president joe biden’s  “american families plan” last month what has he proposed and why does this spell trouble for crypto hodlers – even those who aren’t liable for the tax themselves biden’s big capital gains tax hike biden wants to raise the highest longterm capital gains tax cgt rate in the us from  to  for people earning more than  a year in the us there are shortterm less than  months and longterm over a year capital gains tax rates shortterm gains are taxed at between  and  while longterm gains attract a tax rate of   or  depending on the individual’s incomebitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies have risen exponentially in the past year as a result longerterm holders now face the spectre of higher capital gains taxes –assuming that they keep holding those earning over  could end up paying  on any profits that includes the existing  surcharge on higher income investors and those in areas such as california or new york with other taxes to add on top could face handing over more than  of the profits on their crypto assets that’s quite the increase and while republicans strongly oppose biden’s tax plans which are partly to fund his twostage infrastructure package the “build back better” plan in reality he can push the package without bipartisan support if it turns out to be necessary so there’s a decent chance of it actually getting onto the statute books the tax measures may trigger a selloff in crypto markets clearly if you’re going to see profits taxed more highly in the future then some investors might like to take their profits now to be taxed at the lower rate so it’s no surprise that news of the measures proposed late last month triggered a slide in the value of many crypto currencies and if the measures are pushed through then the crypto market should brace itself for a sharp selloff according to several tax experts moneyweek spoke to “it’s a fair assumption that if the proposals become reality that it could generate some significant turbulence in the crypto markets as us investors seek to crystallise gains before any tax increase takes place” says chris etherington a private client tax partner at rsm uk
