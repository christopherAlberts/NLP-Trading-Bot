be careful of those commodities including copper that have gone straight up warns investment guru jim rogers in this interview edited excerptsi am bullish on agriculture commodities have been very strong copper and iron ore are making alltime highs a lot of other commodities are also going up i suspect they need to correct for a while but i am not very good at tradingi expect a correction in most commodities the fundamentals are probably sound but they have all been going straight up when things go straight up they usually correct for a while even if the bull market continues silver is up a lot but it is still down  per cent from its alltime high be careful of those commodities including copper that have gone straight upthe world is going to have electric vehicles in the future electric cars use several time more copper than a regular car so if we are going to have electric vehicles we will use more copper and lithium as the production of copper is not going up much the fundamentals are there to support metalsif us president joe biden spends huge amounts of money on infrastructure it will certainly replace some of the chinese demand which might slow down the whole world wants to spend money on infrastructure now so i would not give up on the infrastructure spending yeti have never bought nor sold bitcoin so i am probably not the right person to ask just looking at the markets it seems that bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies have peaked there were thousands of them and hundreds of them have already disappeared if you are very good at trading it seems to be a nice trading vehicle i am not a trader and i am not good at it but if you are good at trading why not try until they make it illegali would not be trading them now as there has been too much of a bubble bubbles have always popped i have no idea when this will pop it does not look sound at the moment from a trading point of view but then i am a bad tradersilver has gone up a lot in the last couple of years it has more than doubled but it is still  per cent below its alltime high i own silver and i expect it to make a new alltime high sometime in the next few years and gold tooi am long on nearly all commodities i suspect that commodities will go up for several years now oil is down  per cent from its alltime high so there is a lot of upside left in commodities i have no idea how long it will take when stocks will go in a bear market sometime in  years then probably commodities will also join them for a while however commodities can do very well during a bear phase in stocks because it is seen as an inflation hedge
