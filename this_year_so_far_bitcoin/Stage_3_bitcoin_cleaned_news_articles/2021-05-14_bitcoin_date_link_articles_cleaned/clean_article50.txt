michael barbarofrom the new york times i’m michael barbaro this is the daily what started out as a kind of inside joke in the world of cryptocurrency has quickly become for some a very serious path to wealth today kevin roose on the latest frenzy around a digital currency and what it tells us about the flaws in the old economy and the risks and rewards of the new oneit’s friday may  so kevin the last time we spoke with you you had quite improbably made  by selling a picture of your column in the form of a nonfungible token so what have you been up to since thenkevin roosewell quick update the value of cryptocurrency has skyrocketed in the time since that episode so the nft that i sold is actually now worth about  millionmichael barbaroshow offkevin rooseagain i don’t get to keep it i am a fake cryptocurrency millionaire but there you go so i’ve moved on from nfts but i’ve stayed very interested in the world of cryptocurrency and for the last few weeks there’s been one giant story in the world of cryptocurrency and that is the story of dogecoinarchived recording  we’re going to take dogecoin to the moon archived recording  a positively dogged rise it says here in the price of dogecoinkevin roosedogecoin has been everywherearchived recording its total value stands at  billion more than fedexmichael barbaroevery time i open my tiktok feed there’s a video about dogecoinarchived recording music hold it hold it hold it never sell much rich buy more buy more buy more it’s doing well such highkevin rooseevery time i go on twitter there are people talking about it i have friends that i haven’t talked to in years texting me about whether or not they should invest in itarchived recording music shut up and take my money archived recording every day the internet has a main character and today reddit and twitter have decided that main character is dogecoin archived recording music dogecoin to the moon and beyondmichael barbaroso unlock that word and that concept for us as only you can dogecoinkevin roosesure so dogecoin is something like bitcoin or ethereum or any of these other cryptocurrencies it’s a way to send and receive money on the internet and it was created in  during the first real speculative mania around bitcoin and it was literally meant as a joke these two programmers created it to poke fun at how seriously all these investors and speculators were taking cryptocurrency and basically they decided we should make fun of the people trading cryptocurrencies by making our own joke cryptocurrency so they take this meme this shiba inu dog who was called doge that was popular in the  internet — who would talk in comic sans and would say things like “much wow” “so scare” so they decided we’re going to combine bitcoin with doge and make dogecoinmichael barbarook and just how clear is it to everyone that this is a parody a jokekevin rooseoh it’s completely clear to everyone because not only is the whole idea of dogecoin just on its face absurd and ridiculous but the technology itself — the coin itself — is actually broken in this way that makes it unusable as a cryptocurrency bitcoin and all these other cryptocurrencies they have this capped supply the code actually limits the number of coins that can be created but at the beginning dogecoin doesn’t have that cap there just wasn’t a limit on the number of coins that could be produced and recently they’ve gone back and fixed that they’ve added a cap but it shows you how absurd this whole project wasmichael barbarook so given that context who would bother to trade this parody of a currency dogecoinkevin rooseso for most of its life dogecoin is basically worthless one dogecoin is worth a tiny fraction of cent and it periodically gets popular people talk about it for a minute the price goes up a little bit and then it comes back down and it basically just fades into the background as all of these other cryptocurrencies are becoming real and legitimate and are seeing their values go up so this year as bitcoin and ethereum and these other cryptocurrencies are having another massive run dogecoin made this very strange comeback it totally exploded and so i’m watching all this happen i’m hanging out on the dogecoin subreddit — for work i promise and i kept hearing about these big time dogecoin traders there was one in particular people on the dogecoin subreddit that were calling him like the dogefather or slumdoge millionairekevin roose would you mind just introducing yourself and explaining a little bit about who you are glauber contessoto yeah surekevin rooseand his name is glauber contessotoglauber contessoto so i go by jason or pro but my birth name is glauber contessotokevin roosewe get on a video call he’s a big guy big beard he’s got a picture of jay z behind himglauber contessoto and i work here in la i work at a music company a hip hop music companykevin rooseso glauber is  years old he was born in brazil he came to the us when he was six years old and his family landed in the washington dc areaglauber contessoto we basically grew up very poor so i remember growing up we were in a little apartment basement kind of area i shared a room with my sister until i was kevin roosehis mom and dad didn’t even have their own roomglauber contessoto they had like a back end of the apartment that we had to put a divider up so they had some privacy i remember always wondering why we were on a budget or why we were so poor there were certain instances where i would go to my room and go through the toy box and the closet and find old toys and stuff and pile them in my backpack and i’d take them to school and then on the way to school on the school bus i would sell them to kids and they’d give me their lunch money like   here and there and i used to come home with  and my mom was like how the hell did you get  and i was like i was just selling some old toys i hadkevin rooseso he graduates from high school goes to college but ends up dropping out and then stays in the dc area for a while and he meets this aspiring rapper and decides to manage him and he really wants to work in the music industryglauber contessoto so i’m like all right what do we have to do we need to get the hell out of here ok we need to get out of maryland maryland is not the place for music so i’m like either i’m moving to new york or la i had some friends out here already so i was like la it iskevin rooseand like a lot of people who moved to la hoping to have a career in the entertainment industry glauber has a dream he wants to buy a houseglauber contessoto that’s what i’ve always wanted to do my family has never owned a house so i was like i want to buy a house and the reason for me buying a house is i wanted to get a bunch of rooms so my artists could come live with me like i’d get lambo to come out here and live there and work on music he doesn’t have to worry about rent doesn’t have to worry about food or anythingkevin roosebut when he gets to la he does not have anywhere near the amount of money he’s going to need to do thatglauber contessoto so i’m sleeping on couches i have a friend of mine in van nuys i’m sleeping on his couch and then i sleep on a couch in west hills so i actually have screenshots of all of  of my bank account because to motivate myself i changed the name of my bank account to “pro is broke as ” and then i had the little part there and it’d be like  or  or  or something like that in my account it was crazy so — kevin roose i didn’t change the name of your bank account glauber contessoto yeah you can it’s so funnykevin rooseand he starts picking up some freelance video editing gigs he’s making like  a month and he eventually gets this break he gets a job at a startup in la they’re having him do entrylevel video editingglauber contessoto they offer me  and i’m blown away i’m like  a year that’s crazy i’m telling my friends about it i’m like i just got a job it’s  a year my friends are like that’s not a lot you should ask for more so i ask for  they’re like  and i’m like all right  please and they’re like all right so they give me  first year i get kevin rooseand as he starts getting more experienced and taking on more responsibilities he eventually starts making a little more moneykevin roose  glauber contessoto i’m running the entire department i’m overseeing all these things i’m getting the youtube channel so many more views and more revenue so i go from  to  all i do is work right kevin roose so you’re making a little bit more money at that point did you change the name of your bank account glauber contessoto yes i did i just went back to what it was beforekevin rooseso at that point he’s not sleeping on couches anymore he’s renting a place with his brother but as he’s continuing to save up he really develops tunnel vision on this goal of buying a houseglauber contessoto i do everything in my power to do that i’m saving every bit of money that i can my money every month is literally going to bills my car is a piece of shit i’m not going out shopping i’m not going on vacation i’m not going to concertskevin rooseso at the beginning of  he finally has enough money saved up that he thinks he can start looking for a house but that turns out not to be easyglauber contessoto i can’t get a loan for the life of me no mortgage company is loaning me because i need to put down at least  percentkevin roosehe just can’t find any place that’s within his budgetglauber contessoto so i’m like all right i have to make my house choices lower right so i tried about two or three different houses nothing happened i’m like this is my last shot at this right i’m gonna find a house that’s  because i could do  percent of thatkevin rooseso he starts working with a realtor and eventually —glauber contessoto i find this house in the woods past pasadena up by the mountains and it’s  it’s a little cottage place i’m like i mean i could blast music we can do a studio in there that’s fine at least i’ll have a house right that’s all i ever wantedkevin rooseso he gets really excited he can actually afford a down payment on this placeglauber contessoto so the realtor calls the house calls me back the next day and says oh they’re cash only you got to pay for the whole thingkevin rooseand so his dream is dashed againmichael barbaroright because he doesn’t have  he just has enough for a down paymentkevin rooserightglauber contessoto i’m like that’s it i can’t get a house god doesn’t want me to get a housekevin rooseand he ultimately decides maybe this just isn’t in the cards for me right nowmichael barbaroso this is a pretty depressingly familiar version of the american dream a guy who comes from not very much works really hard tries to save up does save up and still feels stuck because in a city like los angeles given the economics of trying to buy a home he is actually stuck the system is just not working for himkevin rooseexactly this whole classic sense of you work hard you climb the ladder you buy a house you settle down that version of the economy is just not really working for him but then he figures out that he actually has another optionmichael barbarowe’ll be right backkevin rooseso  the pandemic hits go into lockdown and over the course of that year glauber stops thinking about buying a house and starts just focusing on work but then this year —glauber contessoto  gamestop happens rightkevin roosethis weird thing happens with gamestop this video game storemichael barbaroright this weird thing being a social media frenzy around gamestop that leads the stock to soar creates enormous wealth for the people who got in early but more than that it also sent a message to establishment players and finance that regular investors were now in chargekevin rooserightglauber contessoto i first learned about gamestop on — about the reddit group right wallstreetbets i’m like oh let me go look this up i didn’t know anything about reddit i had heard about it never checked it outkevin rooseso basically a bunch of people on this reddit forum called wallstreetbets were teaming up to pump up the stock price of gamestop basically to try to screw these hedge funds that had bet against gamestopglauber contessoto wallstreetbets i’m all over there and i’m like oh gamestop looks like a good idea we’re going to stick it to the man let’s go little guys versus the big guys the big hedge funds let’s bleed them drykevin rooseand this all went up spectacularly and then came crashing down spectacularly and there was this whole drama with robinhood this smartphone app that people are using to buy and sell gamestop stock which temporarily shuts down it becomes this basically this huge nationwide financial frenzyglauber contessoto so what do i do i buy a bunch of gamestop when it’s kevin rooseand glauber actually participatesglauber contessoto the very next day robinhood shuts it down you can’t buy anything and it goes down and i’m seeing myself losing money losing moneykevin rooseand proceeds to lose most of his money the next day when it crashes but despite the fact that he lost money trading gamestop he also saw that some people who got in and out at the right time had actually made millions of dollars trading gamestop and that gets glauber thinking if i could figure out the next gamestop before it happens maybe that’s my ticketglauber contessoto while i go through the reddit somebody posts has dogecoin ever gone to  and then i’m like what the hell is dogecoinkevin rooseand that’s when he hears about dogecoinglauber contessoto so i start researching dogecoin and i’m like oh you can buy this on robinhood this is coolkevin roosethis thing that is really taking off on the internet that is exciting people that’s getting people interested in investing and that the people who get in on the ground floor of this might actually be able to make some money off of itglauber contessoto so i’m on robinhood and dogecoin — i search it and i’m like oh shit i could just buy it here i have an extra  somehow my buying power or whatever right so i take those  i put it in dogecoin i’m like this is fun let’s see what happens put it on dogecoinkevin rooseso he starts smallglauber contessoto and the very next day dogecoin goes from a penny to  i’m staring at my phone watching it go from  to  to  to    kevin roosethe price of dogecoin goes up like  percentmichael barbarowowglauber contessoto i’m like i don’t know what the hell this is but i’m not missing the next time this happens i have to get in on this no stock i’ve ever purchased before has ever done thiskevin rooseand he’s realizing oh this might be actually happening i might have bet rightglauber contessoto so that’s when i’m like what’s dogecoin i go through the entire history i learn everything i could possibly learn about it i research it for hours on end i even have screenshots of my phone and how my screen time was  hours a day on the phone researching this stuffkevin roosehe gets very very excited about it starts spending a lot more time in the dogecoin subreddit and he becomes even more optimistic about what dogecoin is going to domichael barbaroso what’s drawing him to doge is not the intrinsic value of a dogecoin but the fact that lots of other people are excited about and being drawn into dogekevin rooseright in a way it’s purely speculative he’s just betting that this thing that is going up will continue to go up but he also starts developing this bigger idea about dogecoin and cryptocurrency and what kind of has value in today’s economymichael barbaroand why in his mind does dogecoin have value in this economy what does he tell youkevin roosehe basically sees that the world of the attention economy of memes and funny videos and shares and retweets it’s merging with the stock market and so you have these companies like gamestop or tesla or something that people on the internet just decide is a meme like a meme stock and so their goal is just to have fun with it to push it as high as they can get it and then hopefully get out before it all comes crashing down and he sees the cycle happening and so he sees that if something is capturing people’s attention it’s probably a good idea to invest in it earlymichael barbaroright i mean warren buffett would scoff at this the fundamentals of this don’t make any sense there aren’t sales there aren’t profits but the wisdom of crowds says that this is worth more and more and more and glauber subscribes to that beliefkevin rooseright and i think it goes without saying this is not what a typical financial adviser would recommend doing but glauber has this new millennial gen z way of looking at the stock market which is that it doesn’t really matter what the underlying value of something is it’s more about attention and momentum and figuring out where the culture is going than it is about the actual soundness of the investmentglauber contessoto wake up — go to sleep for a few hours wake up next day bam up at   goes back down to  i’m like this isn’t going down to  ever again this isn’t going down to  ever again this is going to go upkevin rooseand then there’s this tipping pointmichael barbaroand when is thatkevin roosein february of this year elon musk ceo of tesla one of the richest men in the world and selfappointed king of the meme internet starts tweeting about dogecoin he calls it the people’s crypto and he says that he’s actually buying dogecoin for his songlauber contessoto elon does a blast of eight or nine or ten tweets back to back to back to back and it shoots up from  to  to  to  i’m like this is it this is the blast off i’m missing it right nowkevin rooseand glauber starts thinking about this as the point of no return like dogecoin is popular it’s getting more popular elon musk is tweeting about it this thing is going to the moon as they say on redditglauber contessoto so now i was like i’m going all in this last thing was it for mekevin rooseand so he makes up his mind and he decides to put everything he has into dogecoinmichael barbarocan you quantify that what do you meankevin roosei mean everything like his entire life savingskevin roose how much money did you decide to invest glauber contessoto total it was  at  centskevin roosehe put in about michael barbarowow that’s a lot of moneykevin roosea lot of money and actually —glauber contessoto i say total because i took money out in margin kevin roose meaning you borrowed money — glauber contessoto i borrowed money from robinhood correctkevin roosehe went into debt so that he could buy more dogecoinmichael barbaroso how does this quarter million dollar bet end up playing out for glauberkevin rooseso he goes all in in february and for the first couple of months it doesn’t really make him much money the price of dogecoin is just flat it’s like  or  and he’s watching it go up a little bit down a little bit it’s not moving much but then april  rolls aroundmichael barbarowhat happens thenkevin rooseso that day it’s a thursday elon musk — he’s been tweeting about dogecoin off and on for a long time — posts this image on twitter it’s actually a painting of a dog barking at the moon and he captions it “doge barking at the moon” and people on reddit get super excited because the moon in reddit speak is what happens when something goes viral right on cue the price of dogecoin starts to skyrocketmichael barbaroand what does this mean for glauberglauber contessoto man it was the craziest day because like i said i knew in my heart it was going to go upkevin rooseso he’s just watching all this happen in real time he’s looking at his phone at the value of his investmentglauber contessoto when this starts climbing and i start seeing more money in my account than i’ve ever seen in my entire life —kevin rooseit’s just going up and up and upglauber contessoto      kevin rooseit’s adding just hundreds of thousands of dollars in minutesglauber contessoto i’m waiting for a dip at any point a crash i’m like it’s going to go back to  or whatever any time but it keeps goingkevin rooseand eventually the price of dogecoin ends up going up hundreds of percentage points that day like more than triple the value at the start of the dayglauber contessoto so i know the exact time it happened it was april  at  pm i’m staring at my phone like i usually do and i’m looking at it and it’s going up going up going upkevin rooseand the value of glauber’s dogecoin investment —glauber contessoto and then it crosses over the million markkevin roosecrosses  millionglauber contessoto and i’m like it’s today today now right now i’m a millionaire i’m  years old i just became a millionairemichael barbarowowkevin rooseyeah it’s wildglauber contessoto i texted my mom i was like mom your son’s a millionaire she was like you’re lying no you’re not blah blah blah i sent her a screenshot — i have a screenshot of all that i sent it to her and i was like your son’s finally a millionaire i was like everything’s going to be all right i was like you can start looking at houses and she writes me back she’s like all i want is you and your sister’s happiness and i’m good that shit it was crazy man this thing changed my lifekevin rooseand it doesn’t even stop thereglauber contessoto  hours later  am the next day it hits  millionkevin roosethe price of dogecoin just keeps going up and up and up and by the time i talked to him —glauber contessoto i could show you guys on the screen right now if you want to seekevin roosewhat is it can you just read that to meglauber contessoto yeahkevin roosehe had turned his original investment of about  into —glauber contessoto at this very second it’s at kevin roosealmost  millionmichael barbarowowkevin roose yeah that’s a big number glauber contessoto that’s a huge number oh it just went upmichael barbarothat is truly astonishing and basically an overnight fortunekevin rooseyeah this is awkward i’m blushing as i’m explaining this to you michael but he is very proud because to go from his initial investment to  million took exactly  days and  is the sex number which he thinks is funny because  in dogecoin world is a very funny number for reasons that i’m not going to explain to listeners of this podcastmichael barbarobut of course this wealth is paper wealth he has to sell dogecoin in order to get it and i’m nervous just hearing you tell this story on glauber’s behalf because i think it might be time for him to sell so does he sellkevin roosenoglauber contessoto no it didn’t cross my mind not once to sell itmichael barbaroand why notkevin roosebecause he sees this as a longterm investmentkevin roose i guess a lot of people in your situation would say ok i made this bet it paid off now i’m gonna just take some money off the table i’m going to make sure i have enough money to buy a house and i’ll keep some money in maybe but i’m going to just make sure i have a little bit of security in case it does crash in case it does turn out to be a bubble but you didn’t do that glauber contessoto no kevin roose why not glauber contessoto i know this is not the best example but if you could buy into amazon when it was  a share would you have sold when it hit  or when it hit  no you wouldn’tkevin roosei think part of the reason is just he thinks it’s going to keep going up he doesn’t want to miss out on the gains that he’ll make if dogecoin goes to  or  or glauber contessoto if i could go back in time and buy bitcoin when it was at  and sold it at  you know what i mean you wouldn’t do thatkevin roosebut he’s also got this ideological motivationglauber contessoto i look at dogecoin as the future i truly believe in the cryptocurrency i believe dogecoin is the future of currencykevin rooselike a lot of people he thinks that the old financial system with all the banks and hedge funds and transaction fees and middlemen that’s all becoming obsoleteglauber contessoto my generation just woke up almost i feel like we woke up and we’re taking this shit on our own we realize the system is rigged the stock market’s rigged wall street they all play their game hedge funds play their game if they’re winning it’s all good and fine and dandy and you can buy and sell all you want it’s a free trade as soon as they start losing billions they change the ruleskevin rooseand the thing that’s replacing it is this parallel economy that’s growing up around the internet this cryptocurrency economyglauber contessoto cryptocurrency is a new space it’s the future there aren’t any hedge funds trying to keep us down there isn’t any billionaires on the other side that if we win they lose so the same way we all pooled around gamestop we can pool around dogecoin and actually change the future of currencykevin rooseso he’s optimistic about cryptocurrency but he’s specifically optimistic about dogecoinglauber contessoto it’s the most friendly the funnest the most exciting cryptocurrency kids will get into it old people will get into it people that don’t know anything about cryptocurrency dogecoin is the bridge dogecoin bridges the gap between the real world and the cryptocurrency world kevin roose if you’re wrong and dogecoin loses  percent of its value tomorrow would you have any regrets glauber contessoto i’ll buy the dip kevin roose you’ll buy more glauber contessoto yeah kevin roose you’re a madmanmichael barbarokevin when i think about the story that glauber has told you it ultimately feels like a tale of economic frustration and someone looking for a shortcut to the wealth that they’re not finding through traditional workkevin rooseyeah i think in some way he represents the attitudes of this cohort of young people who are getting out into the economy who are trying to make it the old way climbing the ladder one rung at a time and they’re realizing that actually might not work anymore and so they’re looking for trampolines basically they’re looking for big bets that they can take maybe it won’t work but maybe it will and that’s the kind of return that’s actually going to get them the kind of stability that they’ve been dreaming aboutmichael barbarowell since you mentioned trampoline let’s talk though about the risks involved in bouncing around on a trampoline as an economic philosophy in lifekevin rooseyeah i mean the only time i’ve ever broken a bone fun fact is on a trampoline so i know that trampolines are risky they’re not a safe thing to play around on and even within the speculative mania of cryptocurrency there are people who think that dogecoin is the least responsible thing you could invest in that it’s a joke people are going to lose everything basically even people who believe in cryptocurrency some of them are saying dogecoin is going to end up going very badly for people but to glauber that risk is not a turnoffglauber contessoto scared money don’t make no money that’s just the reality of it people get scared and people want to be safe and not take any riskskevin roosein fact that’s what draws him to dogecoin he wants the riskglauber contessoto i feel like those experts on tv and the older generation of old money and wealth they try to scare people into staying safe right into not taking these big risks it’s almost like they want to keep everybody in the safe zone so nobody gets too rich nobody touches the  percent you know what i mean i feel like my generation we’re not taking that shit we’re learning for ourselves i’m not going to take what an expert says on tv for their wordkevin roosehe doesn’t want to do it the safe way because he thinks maybe this is his trampoline maybe this is the risk that is going to pay off for himmichael barbaroso kevin before i let you go i know that you spoke to glauber about a week ago which is an eternity in the cryptocurrent market so what’s going on with his holdings in dogecoinkevin roosewell dogecoin has had a rough week on saturday elon musk spiritual leader of the dogecoin movement hosted saturday night live there was a skit about dogecoin and immediately following the show the price of dogecoin started to plummet and lost about  percent of its valuemichael barbarowowkevin rooseso glauber and everyone else who invested in dogecoin took a hit he’s still up he’s still a millionaire on paper and on his app but he’s not quite as rich as he was a couple of weeks ago in the dogecoin reddit there’s a saying that the price of dogecoin never falls it only goes on sale and so when i emailed glauber and asked if he was having regrets about not having sold his dogecoin when the price was higher he said nope and in fact he bought  more dogecoinmichael barbarohe bought the dip as he promised he wouldkevin rooseas he promised he wouldmichael barbarokevin as always thank you very muchkevin roosethank you for having meglauber contessoto i mean it’s a rags to riches story bro i’m trying to tell you this shit changed my entire life kevin roose maybe it’s a rags to riches and back to rags glauber contessoto you know what this is this is the story of the underdoge i’ve always felt like the underdog my whole life i’m serious man i’ve always had a chip on my shoulder always been like there’s got to be more there’s got to be more to life i’ve got to be able to accomplish more there’s no way it’s just this kevin roose yeah well thank you again for your time and i’ll call you back if i have other questions but this was really really fun glauber contessoto awesome kevin roose all right take care glauber contessoto all righty bye byemichael barbarowe’ll be right back here’s
