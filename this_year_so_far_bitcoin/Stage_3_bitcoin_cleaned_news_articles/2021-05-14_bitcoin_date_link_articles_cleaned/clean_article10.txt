friday may  on may   the staff of the division of investment management “im” within the securities and exchange commission “sec” issued a statement the “statement” regarding the staff’s current views on funds registered under the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” investing in bitcoin  although the statement most directly illustrates the staff’s current stance toward mutual funds investing in bitcoin futures more significantly given the intense interest in potential bitcoin and other cryptocurrency products the statement is being scrutinized for what it might say about the willingness of the staff to approve exchangetraded products offering exposure to bitcoin or other cryptocurrenciesthe statement conveys the staff’s view that mutual funds should only invest in bitcoin futures if the funds have “investment strategies that support this type of investment” as well as full disclosure of the relevant risks the statement does not support exchangetraded funds etfs investing in bitcoin futures at this time though the staff remains open to further discussion on the topic even though closedend funds are not subject to the same liquidity risks from the bitcoin futures market as mutual funds or etfs the statement nevertheless recommends that sponsors of closedend funds consult the staff prior to filing for a closedend fund that would invest in bitcoin futures finally while the statement does not address the recent spate of filings for exchangetraded products that would hold bitcoin directly and are not registered under the  act the statement conveys certain concerns that are likely to apply to the sec’s consideration of those products as well backgroundin january  dalia blass the thendirector of im issued a letter the “cryptocurrency holdings letter” to the heads of the investment company institute and the asset management group of the securities industry and financial markets association outlining significant concerns on the part of the im staff that would need to be addressed by any registered fund offering exposure to  those concerns were a valuation b liquidity c custody d arbitrage for etfs and e potential for manipulation and other risks as the bitcoin futures market had only commenced trading in december  the discussion in the cryptocurrency holdings letter primarily focused on issues relating to funds proposing to hold bitcoin directly bitcoin futuresthe statement notes that since the cryptocurrency holdings letter was issued the bitcoin futures market has grown  consistently producing reportable prices and avoiding the custody issues that would be presented under the  act if funds held bitcoin directly because bitcoin futures contracts currently are cashsettled moreover in recent months certain mutual funds have made filings disclosing their intention to invest some portion of their assets in bitcoin futures andor private investment funds that hold  the statement notes this trend and declares that the staff “will closely monitor and assess such mutual funds’ and investment advisers’ ongoing compliance with the  act and the rules thereunder and the other federal securities laws”in addition the statement states that the im staff in coordination with staff from the division of economic and risk analysis and division of examinations will “closely monitor the impact of mutual funds’ investments in bitcoin futures on investor protection capital formation and the fairness and efficiency of markets” the statement identifies the following items that the staff will monitorthe liquidity and depth eg number of participants of the bitcoin futures market and whether it is appropriately supporting mutual fund investment in bitcoin futures particularly as additional mutual fund assets enter the market given regulatory requirements relating to mutual fund liquidity the ability of mutual funds to liquidate bitcoin futures positions as necessary to meet daily redemption demands as well as the efficacy of mutual funds’ derivatives risk management  and the extent of any leverage obtained through derivativesthe valuations of holdings in the bitcoin futures market utilized by funds and how such valuations are affected by mutual fund participation in the bitcoin futures market on valuations in that market as well as the impact on valuation of any disruptions in the underlying bitcoin marketspursuant to the liquidity rule mutual funds’ liquidity classification of any position in the bitcoin futures market and the basis for such classification as well as the overall construction of such a fund’s liquidity risk management program the ongoing impact of the potential for fraud or manipulation in the underlying bitcoin markets and its possible influence on the bitcoin futures market  andwhether in light of the experience of mutual funds investing in the bitcoin futures market the bitcoin futures market could accommodate etfs the statement notes that unlike mutual funds etfs cannot prevent additional investor assets from coming into the  to address situations where an etf becomes too large or dominant in the market or if the liquidity in the bitcoin futures market starts to wane guidancethe statement concludes with the following summaries of the im staff’s current views with respect to funds’ investments in bitcoin futuresthe im staff believes that only mutual funds “with appropriate strategies that support this type of investment and full disclosure of material risks” should pursue investment in the bitcoin futures market at this timethe im staff “welcomes further input from etfs and other market participants particularly input that focuses on efforts to ensure compliance with the  act and its rules and promote investor protection”because closedend funds do not provide for daily redemption of their shares they are not subject to the same liquidity requirements and do not present the same types of liquidity challenges as openend funds nevertheless the im staff “encourages any closedend fund that seeks to invest in the bitcoin futures market to consult with the staff prior to filing a registration statement about the fund’s proposed investment anticipated compliance with the  act and its rules and how the fund would provide for appropriate investor protection”the im staff also promises to be “transparent about its approach to registered funds’ investment in the bitcoin futures market as well as other types of cryptocurrency and digital asset investing” takeawayswe believe that there could be important ramifications for mutual funds and etfs as a result of the statementmutual funds the statement does not address what type of investment strategies might be “appropriate” for a fund to invest in bitcoin futures contracts nor does it address whether the staff would have concerns if an existing mutual fund changed its investment objective or strategies so that they would then be “appropriate” for investing in bitcoin futures nevertheless the statement makes it clear that the im staff will consider carefully whether a mutual fund’s strategy is appropriate for investing in bitcoin futures and whether the applicable risks are appropriately disclosed  act etfs the sec has not yet permitted the offering of  actregistered funds that are etfs and provide bitcoin exposure by investing in bitcoin futures  the statement indicates that the im staff is still open to discussion about whether the bitcoin futures market has developed to an extent that would make it possible to offer etfs based on bitcoin futures but does not indicate that the im staff is likely to approve such etfs imminentlyclosedend funds despite closedend funds not being subject to the same liquidity requirements and risks as openend funds the im staff still recommends in the statement that closedend funds desiring to invest in bitcoin futures discuss the fund’s strategies and processes for addressing compliance risks with the im staff before filing a registration statement among other factors the concerns identified in the statement regarding whether the bitcoin futures market has sufficient liquidity and depth to accommodate multiple mutual funds could apply to closedend funds as well exchangetraded products not registered under the  act in recent months several filings have been made for exchangetraded products “etps” that would offer exposure to bitcoin by holding bitcoin directly  these etps would be registered under the securities act of  as amended and trade on a national stock exchange but would not be registered under the  act previous filings for such products have been made in prior years but either were withdrawn or disapproved by the sec  the statement does not directly address this class of etps because it was issued by the im staff and only covers  act funds wishing to invest in bitcoin futures nevertheless several of the issues identified in the statement regarding the bitcoin futures market would apply in substance to bitcoin etps that are not registered under the  act for example the sec previously has identified the bitcoin futures market as not being a “market of sufficient size” to deter potential manipulation in the underlying bitcoin markets for purposes of the sec’s authority to approve or disapprove exchange listing rules under section  of the securities exchange act of  as amended  — and while the statement acknowledges the growth of the bitcoin futures market in recent years the statement expressly disclaims any position on whether the bitcoin futures market is now a market of “sufficient size” for such purposes  it seems likely that the im staff’s determination of whether the bitcoin futures market is sufficiently liquid and deep to accommodate  act etfs will be made in coordination with the determination as to whether the market is of sufficient size to allow for the offering of  act bitcoin etps see staff statement on funds

income tax purposes as almost all mutual funds are must derive at least  of its gross income as a result mutual funds may need to consider investing in bitcoin futures through a whollyowned foreign
