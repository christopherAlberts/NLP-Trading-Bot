when buckminster fuller was asked by a  boy how he would suggest solving international problems without violence he answered“i always try to solve problems by some artifact some tool or invention that makes what people are doing obsolete so that it makes this particular kind of problem no longer relevant my answer would be to develop a world energy grid an electric grid where everybody is on the same grid all of a sudden there would be no problems anymore no international troubles our new economic basis wouldnt be gold or dollars it would be kilowatt hours”the above quote from the prescient buckminster fuller in  was in reference to his now famous prognostication of the “kilowatt dollar” something he first discussed as far back as  three years before nixon took us off the gold standard while mr fuller was referring to a theoretical energybased unit of money what he could not have realized at the time is that he was really talking about bitcoinmoney our most fundamental unit of social information technology● in a free market society the greatest network of information by far is price which itself is at its core an intersubjective agreement of value money is the abstraction of that value● the “schelling point” for participants in a society is whichever money exists that can best transmit that price information this is where money “wants” to go● money is therefore the facilitator of our communication and distribution of all economic resources all innovation and societal progress flows from this communication it is perhaps the most elementary and consequential social tool we have and has been essential to our species’ ability to successfully scale ie dominate and hyperexponentially populate the earth● this principle of money while simultaneously vague and grandiose is perhaps so because it is taken for granted abstracted away and obfuscated by technocrats economists and politicians alike who are currently copiloting our existing monetary system● importantly money is also the means to transfer uncertainty and risk to those willing to bear that uncertainty this is one of the key manners in which money acts as information beyond price itself as monetary transfer of risk and uncertainty unveils invaluable morsels of information by way of successes and failures it builds antifragility in the system with these increments of volatility throughout time without money there would be no measure of volatility no means to evaluate success or failure and no motivation for such risktransferring behavior● more specifically a medium of risk transmission is necessary for the accumulation of productive capital risktakers and those with the appropriate skills to build new productive capital are not always the same people those who already have accumulated wealth are not always those most fit to build new capital stock thus a marketplace is needed to allow the swapping of risk in order to build the capital stock money is the medium for such transactionswith these fundamental and philosophical logos as our background state let us now explore how money as information technology is key to our grokking of money’s entanglement with the harnessing of energy as a means to advance civilization not only does such an exploration help us to establish just how detrimental fiat forms of money are to the process of energy phase transitions but it helps us realize just how invaluable bitcoin is as a means to extricate ourselves from the socioeconomic dilemma we currently faceabove the kardashev scale a theory originating from russian astrophysicist nicolai kardashev that touches upon the themes of this article namely the relationship between technology and energy the theory posits that to know a civilization’s capacity to advance one must know the available energy it can harness unfortunately earth currently is defined as type  unable to yet harness all the energy available on our planet and not even on the above evolutionary map image sourceenergy monetary entropy and information parityfor the purposes of the below discussion let us define entropy in its simplest manner high entropy is a state of high disorder whereas low entropy is a state of high orderan entropy equilibrium hypothesisthermodynamic entropy te increases are always balanced by a commensurate decrease in information entropy ie so thatte   iewhere a positive value indicates an increase in entropy and a negative value indicates a decrease in entropythis hypothesis is essentially an adaptation of the second law of thermodynamics combining it with concepts from information theory and using these observations to create a formula that is more comprehensively applicable to human economic activities it is a restatement of this law so as to better understand the relationship between energy money and information it is simple and symmetricalthe power of xx   technological innovation’s exponential order of scaling○ human productivity involves taking our temporary and low entropy states — elegant organizations of doublehelixed organic and carbonbased existence — and transforming these arrangements into higher entropy states as we consume other low entropy energy matter to then produce higher entropy energy in the form of work○ technological innovation enables us to do this work easier faster better and more abundantly with the same quantity of resources this is also called productivityaccording to the renowned information theory of claude shannon“ if information  resolved uncertainty entropy must be the uncertainty needing resolving”in shortinformation  reduced entropytechnology in turn is what allows information to scalelet us further unpack this concept of information at least in the context of this article as unstructured data manipulated into a structured and intentionally ordered format that reduces uncertaintyjust as the first law of thermodynamics teaches us that energy can neither be created nor destroyed likewise the second law of thermodynamics states that thermodynamic entropy always increases over time however this law says nothing of entropy inherent to information or specific human systems such as market economies consequently the second law of thermodynamics says nothing of the impact of human technological ingenuity on other forms of entropy particularly related to informationgiven all this analysis we can refine the above formula further astex  iehowever this equation spartan as it is is not complete at least when applied to human social and economic systems as previously discussed given that money is perhaps the basest unit of information technology for social scaling we must incorporate it into this formula along with the general exponential order of technological scaling so thatxme whereby me monetary entropywe will define monetary entropy as the longterm inflation rate of that money in truth monetary entropy is influenced by much more than monetary inflation alone discussed further below but for the sake of parsimony let us be content with this lean definition for the momentwe can now write the hypothesis more comprehensively asthe crucial realization as it concerns the important paradigm shift inherent to bitcoin is as follows fiat money involves a net increase in entropythis cannot be overstated and is imperative to this article’s thesis such a conclusion is reached despite money theoretically being a form of information that should reduce entropy when applied as intended however fiat unfortunately is not money as money was intended inflation centralized and thus arbitrary control of the rules of supply and attempts at also controlling demand via administered riskfree rates global exchange rate volatility and competitive devaluations and mercantilism subsidies free debtsupporting zombie industries opaque and uneven taxation enforcement and many other behaviors all conspire to create an aggregate equation of massive entropy in fiat money economieswhen money is denominated in fiat me is always   and is often well above this threshold especially in the fullness of timewhen money is denominated in bitcoin me always   period no asterisks no footnotesanother important observation teased out by the above formula is that as texme increases a system’s inputs energy resources exhibit greater scarcitykyle baranko writesif money is not permitted its intrinsic capacity to absorb this scarcity other resources will need to fill that void this increases the cost of information production because there are fewer and fewer sources of increasing thermodynamic entropy from which to convert into decreasing informational entropy consequently the system will experience a drag on productivity such an environment also manifests hidden costs like environmental externalities and systemic fragility which are easily cemented into chronic problems that become difficult to fixif an increase in texme leads to greater thermodynamic or monetary scarcity this implies that the equivalent decline in ie leads to a greater supply of structured ordered information decreasing informational entropy basic laws of supply and demand conclude this will tend to reduce the cost of information proportionallyif in the form of bitcoin money is allowed to absorb thermodynamic entropy money will accrue the incremental scarcity from increases in thermodynamic entropy values this is how we arrive at another “mathematical” phenomenon stated as ngu or more colloquially known as “number go up” growth does not need to  gross domestic product gdp gdp growth  more consumptionthe largest contributing factor to gdp is consumption and this has been growing materially as a percentage of gdp ever since the financialization of our economy via exponential growth in money and debt since the  unraveling of bretton woods the subsequent formation of the fiat standard and the usd petrodollar global reserve system this trend only gets amplified further after each debt shock forcing more and more consumption and leveraging to extricate ourselves from the newly indebted state we create with each cycle this is clearly evidenced in the below chart both at the starting point in the early  since the great financial crisis gfc and more recently the  pandemicconsumption in nominal us dollars as a percentage of us gdp bloomberg datathis is a recipe for disaster it is definitionally unsustainable to grow in perpetuity by this measure given  limited thermodynamic resources and more importantly perhaps  the inefficient use and squandering of these very resources this squandering is effectuated by inflationary monetary policies that do not allow the economy to transition naturally into a lower consumption society resulting from reduced informational entropy and the abundance this could create if we allow it a sustainable path requires a redefinition of growth away from concepts requiring increased consumption quantity of goods and services produced wage growth time worked asset inflationwealth effects etc allowing the evolution of energy information and money to virtuously improve our prosperitygrowth  informational entropy  more time lower time preferencethe above equation helps us visualize a framework for such a dynamic and demonstrates how bitcoin as a base layer with a zero monetary entropy can help propel us into this futuremoney does not  valueinstead it is a measure of value created in an economy good money therefore is information it informs us of our progress bad money blinds us causing us to veer off onto spindly and corroded dirt roadsinflation does not  the consumer price index cpiinflation is not the cost of gas prices it is not lumber prices going up it is not the price of a big mac or your electricity bill it is not even your house’s value appreciatingthe most encompassing definition for inflation is more fundamentally the depreciation of money versus the value otherwise createdinflationary monetary systems obfuscate the value created by societal productivity this simple statement can not be overstated since the early decades of the  century we have errantly accepted inflation as a first principle necessity in all free markets but it is not the natural economic state and in a broader historical context it is actually a fairly recent experiment see gibson’s paradox quite the opposite is true in terms of the natural state of human progress and free market capitalism once this problem is truly appreciated the value of an absolute scarcity that is verifiable immutable and censorship resilient across time and space as well as stateless belonging to the free market we suddenly realize just how incredible an invention this truly is that is the rabbit hole that is bitcoin the notion is subtle but once understood the gravitational desire to dive headfirst down this rabbit hole of myriad societal revolutions becomes an inescapable journey“you never change things by fighting the existing reality to change something build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete” — buckminster fullerbitcoin  a mirrora deflationary monetary system of absolute hard money acts as a mirror for value creation it is a compass to guide us toward a better economic path value is created through human ingenuity environmental necessity and the compounding productivity driven by our accumulation of collective knowledge these forces are often labeled generically as technology or innovation and they always create value decreasing informational entropy said differently all productivity is driven by technology and all technological innovation is deflationary at a fundamental level that is as long as money remains a constant in the equationif however money is inflating we lose our measure of value it would be like using the proverbial yardstick that constantly redefines what a yard is a table is two yards but then a yardstick creates more units and suddenly that table is four yards the table did not grow the measurement unit shrank a store of value is just as it sounds it stores all the productivity and work created if more value is created than a sound money then that money by definition has more purchasing power and stores greater and greater value if instead value is being destroyed by money supply abuse then people will without fail seek to store their value elsewhere money must always therefore start as a store of value before it becomes a medium of exchange deflation is a measure of success in creating economic value as innovation creates more for less if prices decrease by  per year that is a much greater expression of value creation than our current measures that are perversely inverted such as “real gdp” if you print dollars and then count the value created in those very dollars what does that actually tell you what if you could instead calculate the amount of goods and services created versus the dollars created would that not tell us moreconclusionwe live in a time of incredible technological advancements on increasingly exponential growth curves this is taking information production to an unseen scale of abundance but such abundance is diluted and often fully negated by fiat’s perversion of money’s potential to synergistically accommodate such plentitudeif technological productivity has the potential to decrease informational entropy output for each thermodynamic unit of increased entropy input this is the true definition of wealth creation and prosperity more for less fiat not only robs us of this wealth but it adds to the entropic dissipation polluting our ecosystem and making it ever more fragile yes “ecosystem” a word most often associated with environmental dialogues is not coincidentally built from the word “economy” itself with its etymological roots in the greek words for “distribution of the home” as thermodynamic systems are inextricably linked to systems of human productivity informationconcluding with the trite axiom “bitcoin fixes this” does not even begin to do the solution that is bitcoin the justice it deserves bitcoin addresses this problem like cinderella’s slipper it is a perfect fit or a perfect solution in this case not only does the bitcoin network inherently take highly disordered information and asymmetrically through cryptography make this information incredibly ordered as eloquently stated by bitcoiner gigi in his article bitcoin’s eternal struggle but bitcoin the money with its properties of absolute scarcity decentralized consensus immutably programmed supply rulebased and antifragile incentive structure changes the game entirely each of these properties on their own would change the game as they’re each intensely conducive to decreased informational entropy especially when compared to fiat but when combined the synergistic reduction in entropy is perhaps even more exponential than the cambrian explosion of information that is being produced by today’s technological abundanceit will be a great day perhaps a great filter of sorts when the ships of money and other technology can sail along the same currentthis is a guest post by aaron segal opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of btc inc or bitcoin magazine
