the first chapter of jordan peterson’s “ rules for life” relates to bitcoin socially evolutionarily economically and psychologically rules for life series essay onethis article was previously published on mediumforewordi’ve been an avid reader and student of philosophy psychology and other related topics since my early teensmy uncle first influenced and introduced me to thinkers like aristotle alexander the great plato and socrates and as i grew older i discovered many otherssome helped me understand the world and human beings better robbins taleb bruce lee watts clare graves frankl sowell rand hoppe rothbard etc while others helped reinforce the formers’ ideas by either consistently contradicting themselves introducing ridiculous ideas of their own or just regurgitating things others have said but completely out of context thus exhibiting no understanding at all some examples include the likes of marx sam harris derrida harari piketty kelton and keyneseither way they all helped me sharpen and hone my own viewpoints so for that i’m thankful even for the dumb texts i’ve readin the last five years i’ve come to really enjoy and align with the philosophies of a particular individual whom by now you’ve surely guessed is jordan petersonwhile i believe the most profound modern philosopher is likely murray rothbard i believe peterson is the most articulate and for me personally one of the most authentic and courageous people alive todayso today… as an homage to jordan’s work and as an attempt to introduce him and his audience to bitcoin i’ve decided to write a series of articles that examine bitcoin through a jordan b peterson lensi’m going to use his most popular book “ rules for life” as the framework while i’ll follow the structure of the book because each of the chapters is quite dense i will look to glean a number of lessons along the way with my interpretation of the essence of eachi hope you find value in this series of essays and if you’re a bitcoiner who has friends that you’ve not yet been able to orange pill but are aligned with jordan’s ideas and philosophy i hope this becomes a useful resourcelesson one bitcoin hierarchy and territoryjordan’s first rule in the book is “stand up straight with your shoulders back”he explores how the individual’s position in the social hierarchy impacts their hormonal serotonin and dopaminergic systems and vice versa hence making it a feedback loopmore importantly though the essence of the lesson is how by owning oneself and taking responsibility standing up straight you can influence these systems to either cease a downward spiral or commence an upward journey in life“the part of our brain that keeps track of our position in the dominance hierarchy is therefore exceptionally ancient and fundamental it is a master control system modulating our perceptions values emotions thoughts and actions it powerfully affects every aspect of our being conscious and unconscious alike”  peterson “ rules for life”this chapter is extraordinarily dense with so much to unpack and relate to bitcoin it was hard for me to choose a single angle so i’ve explored multiple sections and how they each relate socially evolutionarily economically and psychologicallyterritory and private propertynote i will use the words “territory” and “private property” interchangeablywe live in a world with finite territory and much like any other species including the nowfamous lobsters our ability to subsist relies on how well we select protect and handle our territory aka private property in a more anthropomorphic senseterritory matters a few truths we must come to terms with areyour territory is that which you’re able to successfully defendterritory is scarce particularly the best locales and goodshumanity has over the millennia developed methods of protecting territory because it is fundamental to our survival as a species we are collaborative by nature and the means through which we collaborate is the exchange of private property this private property or territory starts with you and extends to anything you mix your time and energy with on a voluntary basis without having taken it by force from another although the latter does and has happened throughout history hence the critical need for defenceexamples of mechanisms for defence include anything fromwalls and fences land as territoryknives and guns yourself as private propertyvaults and banks your wealth as propertychurches governments and constitutions your thoughts beliefs rights as territorythe math and cryptography embodied in bitcoin which defends private property via the information asymmetry and law of large numberswhat’s important to note here is that without a mechanism for the protection of private property society collapses we are all individuals who are inherently diverse and value everything subjectively we cannot all own a portion of each other nor own a part of everything it’s a physical and social impossibilityterritory is not a “social construct” it’s a biological imperativeit’s the mechanism that’s evolved through which nature achieves balance and equilibrium it’s an emergent bottomup phenomenon not a topdown decree like pseudo scientists would have you believepeterson’s overview on territory is brilliant but i would recommend the incredible work by robert ardrey “the territorial imperative” or you can wait for a piece i’ll be writing in the future entitled “private property as a biological imperative” in which i’ll dig deeper into the aboveso… if territory and private property are central to existence then how do we value order and select it knowing that we are all subjective beings and that all property is scarcehierarchypecking orders are natural phenomena and found across all living systems hierarchies have to develop because life cannot exist without some form of selection and this cannot exist without prioritizationthis is not to say that there is “one” right way life is not so simplistic we exist in a complex world where hierarchies and methods for prioritization emerge across multiple dimensions remember the subjective nature of humans and what they valuein other words hierarchies will always form so the question is not whether they should exist or not that’s like arguing about the existence of gravity but “in what form are hierarchies most conducive to life”as with most things it’s a spectrumon one side we have hierarchies by fiat these are unnatural and abhorrent they exist by decree and because there is little to no skin in the game for some they form at the expense and the exclusion of manyon the other hand we have those which are natural and emergent these are best classified as hierarchies of competence they are ergodic and dynamic by nature because participants have skin in the gamethen of course we have everything in between reality is such that things are messy and the extremes are rareif modernity has shown us anything it’s that institutions that may have initially arisen due to competence and a desire for order but cemented themselves by fiat and thus have become monopolies will not only begin to decay but as described by the cobra effect they will pose a greater danger to existence than the original chaos they set out to managethe most prone to such degeneration enhanced and accelerated by the moral hazard of having no skin in the game are state monopolies on money violence morality and ethics ie law whybecause they are the levers of society they’re the glue which binds us and because of this they seem to incentivize two key reactionsthe need to “control” or at the very least “manage” the spontaneous emergence of order for quality control purposes the intent here may be initially at least positive but like any complex system misguided because centrally managing a process that occurs at the edge is hard enough for a community let alone a city it is not functional at scale and in our bid to do so we do more damage related to the nietzschean will to power those who want it at the expense of everything else and those who may find they’re unable to adequately climb a hierarchy of competence become consumed by envy and want to acquire power selfworth validation and meaning through the acquisition of position by fiat this is a big reason why politics and the public sector is so poisonous the kinds of people it attracts are either naively optimistic in the better scenario or are more often than not envious wolves in sheep’s clothing looking to win popularity contests on their quest to amass power by fiatthis edifice becomes more dangerous and fragile the larger it grows and like the proverbial “beast” that must continually be fed it continues to consume all in its path until it starves and collapsesall hierarchies are dynamic and even natural hierarchies tend to adjust evolve deconstruct and reemerge but fiat hierarchies in particular are prone to catastrophic collapse because through monopolization and the incessant need to control and manage they deviate further from natural order and become increasingly fragilei wrote about fiat versus natural authority at greater length here“resistance is not futile ”pareto’s law and distributioninequality is one of the most “pushed” subjects today and one which is deeply misunderstoodmany who know my work will know my position on inequality i believe there is nothing more natural than inequality and in fact it is the basis of all diversity nuance and life itselfnature is perfect in its imperfection and the result is a naturally unequal distribution of everything from skills to values to likes dislikes shapes sizes interests resources effort and everything else one can perceivethe only thing that should be equal in the world is equality in probability this means the game we’re all playing remains dynamic because we all have skin in the gamethis is by and large how hierarchies naturally emerge grow correct and persist unless of course there is a mechanism via which those at the top can remove their skin from the game and thus remove the natural equality in probability inherent to stable emergent systems after which they decay and collapsepeople are not really angry about inequality but unfairness when the opportunity to move up exists and the risk to fall remains the game is fair and the results are dynamic if not the game is riggedread more here“utopian dystopias”and herethe pareto principle is a perfectly natural power law distribution most commonly known as the  rule and best documented by italian economist vilfredo paretothe pareto principle states that for many outcomes roughly  of consequences come from  of the causesyou know this not only in your own life ie a smaller number of the things you do produce most of the results but can see it all around the world and can even deduce it using some simple logicyou know full well that a few of the songs by a band are their best that a few players in any sport are disproportionately more impactful than the rest that a few actors produce most of the hits that a few hard and smart employees at work produce most of the outputat a macro level this manifests itself as uneven paretotype wealth distributionthink of the following exampletwo people start out working one does the average nine to five while the other decides to work two jobs and save every penny of the secondas they progress the saver builds up a small capital base which he decides to use as his investment capital the other person just continues working the nine to five and hangs out with friends afterwardsfast forward a few years and the saver managed to grow his total wealth through some intelligent investments he now has a greater capital base from which to invest and further compound that wealth ie earning  a few years ago on a  investment may have yielded  but now that same  yields  per month because he’s got  invested for exampletheir proportionate wealth will start to look very much like an  distributionnow here’s the beautiful partthe saver turned investor gets addicted to his strategy and gets super greedy in the process so he decides to take some silly risks to yield  on investment he puts up a large chunk of his capital for it and then loses it because he was wrong about his investmenthe’s now back to square one and needs to practically start all over againthis is the dynamic nature of life and how excessive risk can and does lead to natural rebalancing in any systemnow… let’s look at the situation in an alternate universe saver never gets greedy but gets extremely risk averse instead of investing any more of his capital he just decides to put it all where it’s safe and he no longer cares about growthin this scenario the original spender who has seen his friend get ahead decides that he wants to catch up well he begins to work harder save and put those savings toward investments or activities that can yield a higher return he’s got less to lose he’s younger and as such is willing to take more riskover time he begins to catch up because the original saver is content where he isonce again the system rebalances all distribution is dynamic and can either compound or erode it does not standstill there is no such thing as a static system that’s exactly why equality can never exist it’s a static imaginary utopian dystopian dead stateinequality price’s law and the pareto distribution are all perfectly normalunfairness is the real problem when the game is rigged people get pissed offunfortunately via the monopolization of violence ethics morality and most importantly the production of the most important human technology money the state has managed to rig the gameon a short enough timescale which is long by individual standards they are no longer subject to the downside neither are any of the organizations institutions and representatives that can get close to any of the key monopolies of the statethe result is unnatural distributions and instead of the system rebalancing via natural correction we get these  or even  type distributions of wealthwhybecause “heads they win tails you lose”it’s like playing a game of monopoly with one person keeping their hand in the box of money so they can’t lose or better yet playing a game of poker where the initial leader of the game knows the dealer makes a deal and as such any time he loses on the river he gets bailed out from the chips that are in every other player’s stackif that’s how the game is played the rest of the players will soon leave and that’s exactly what’s happening now with bitcoinpoker is actually a great analogy because it incorporates not only skill but luck prudent early play can get you ahead you have to take risks sometimes you have to bluff sometimes you’ll have to fold if you play well you can amass enough chips to begin to play harder and more rough but the chance to lose it all always exists and thus keeps the game fairmodernity is a rigged poker game and bitcoin fixes it by tearing money out of the hands of any one player and thus reintroducing skin in the game for allfitness and selectionchanging tack a little here is the evolutionary idea of fitness and selectionas jordan writes“the idea of selects contains implicitly nested within it the idea of fitness it is fitness that is selected the fit in fitness is the matching of organismal attributes to environmental demand”fitness is that which is ever more accurately approximated across time and it’s important to note that it’s neither a linear process nor one that is always trending toward more fitnessit’s like a dance there is a direction across time but much like two dancers it moves sways and swings as it hones and adapts toward ever more fitnessbitcoin’s proofofwork network is much the same the difficulty adjustment incentive mechanism and the work required to participate make bitcoin an organism that one can argue are alivebrilliant minds like gigi’s have done this topic far more justice than i can here so i suggest a review of the following“proof of life”furthermore there is the natural selection process we as individuals make in our pursuit of economic survival i’ve called it “economic darwinism” and it’s related to gresham’s law ie good money pushes out bad moneywe select the money that best performs the three key functions of moneystore of value as close to fixed in supply as possible to map to time and energymedium of exchange must be uncensorable bearer asset is bestunit of account measure all other goods with it and have a way to measure against all elsemaking the wrong selection relegates us to poverty and diminishes our capacity to cooperate collaborate and interact with the rest of societyas such we are incentivized to converge and select the fittest mechanism via which the product of our labor can be stored exchanged and measuredthis fittest medium is unequivocally bitcoin and the selfreinforcing convergent nature of the “network effect of money” will only continue to accelerate this realization as it spreads globallythis then brings me to the idea ofstatusstatus is the metaphysical relationship between us and the rest of the worldit’s our relationship to not only the dynamic distribution of all the resources wealth skills shapes sizes etc in the world but our position in the multitude of hierarchies across every dimension and category one comes into contact withthis is where the rubber meets the road and why our systems are hormonally neurologically and biologically wired the way they are“the part of our brain that regulates where we sit in the dominance hierarchy is as old as life” petersonserotonin is one of the master control hormones and seems to have emerged to help us understand manage and influence our relative position in hierarchies and across the spectrum of different distributionsit helps us get a sense of what is top and what is bottomits effect on the system seems also to be reflexive or selfreinforcingthe lower you are on the hierarchy the lower you’re prone to fallthe higher you are the further up you’re likely to comethis is because decision making changes depending on where you are or are perceived by yourself or others to be it can have significant ramifications and is why it’s so important that the game is not rigged in such a way that creates barriers to mobility for an individual’s statusthe bottomheightens your time preferenceyou then spend your resources for the crises of the presentyou are in constant preparedness for the next emergencythese are deevolutionary in naturethe toplowers your time preferenceyou plan for the long termyou can further delay gratificationyou can invest resources for the future while having some for the next emergencyyou can work to secure your positionthese are evolutionary in natureeach have a symbiotic relationship with your production of serotonin and are thus self reinforcingindividuals have the capacity to voluntarily and wilfully “stand up straight with their shoulders back” in order to influence these processes and therefore what matters in a system or a society is enabling mobility in other words the freedom for the individual to take such actionsto stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life with eyes wide open it means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order it means adopting the burden of selfconscious vulnerability and accepting the end of the unconscious paradise of childhood where finitude and mortality are only dimly comprehended it means willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a productive and meaningful realitybitcoin fixes thiswith bitcoin humans can truly stand up straight with their shoulders back becauseprivate property is not only recognized but integral to the systemit is unable to be coopted by any individual organization or institution and is thus able to naturally correct should hierarchies become deformed by fiat or by decreein using math as its form of protectionguaranteesecurity it lowers the cost of defense increases the cost of attack and therefore tilts the inherent incentives of human interaction toward more voluntary cooperation instead of coercive dominionthe above enable organic ergodic and most importantly naturally dynamic hierarchies of competence to form which are more robust antifragile and more immune to corruption by fiatit allows for natural pareto distributions to reemerge and to normalize because of innovation and the competitive nature of markets in which monopolies cannot subsist because a focal monopoly on money is nonexistentunnatural distributions begin to break down because skin in the game is reintroduced and economic bailouts wherein one group pays for the mistakes of another cease to existfitness and selection ie innovation is once again honed in and more generally focused toward real problems and real needs because the deployment of capital once again has a realistic opportunity coststatus becomes mobile once again and tied to competence skill talent effort passion and input instead of fiat the relatively static nature of status that we see today begins to dissolve because downside risk is reintroduced and upside potential is once again accessible by those who want it — no matter who or where they areconclusionjordan’s opening chapter is a treasure trove of information that one could write an entire book about in fact i could probably write a book just on its relationship to bitcoin hint hintfor now i’d like to wrap this up by thanking jordan for his insightful work and noting my hope that he has a chance to view bitcoin through its lensthe framing of order and chaos yin and yang duality or whatever name that simple yet profound principle has donned throughout the ages is something that resonates with me i view bitcoin as something which truly embodies it not only in its operation it is right between entropy and order but in its impact on the worldthe more we allow natural order to emerge from chaos without trying to grasp and stifle it out of an insecure need to make it static the more we’ll see the dynamic selection process that is nature do its thing forming lindycompatible structures and hierarchiescan we stop these hierarchies from succumbing to concentration of power or fiat decaynot entirely because we must allow things to grow and diebut we can create an environment where the corrective nature of the system allows it to rebalance and adapt before it crumblescatastrophic collapse is far less possible in a decentralized localized system where monopolies are inhibited via competition and this matters whether the system is social cultural biological legal or economicit’s not who’s driving the train but how the tracks are laid that really mattersbitcoin is the new train trackwith it we can continue to manifest the promise of not just the west but the wisdom of nature and existencesee you in the next
