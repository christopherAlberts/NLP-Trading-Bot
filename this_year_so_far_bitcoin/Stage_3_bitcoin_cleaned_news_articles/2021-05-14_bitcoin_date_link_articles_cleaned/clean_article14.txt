other cryptocurrencies have no chance at all in competing with the monstrously large bitcoin networkmimesis capital inside the event horizon report bitcoin versus ethereum and other altsit’s been “alt season” for the past couple months bitcoin has remained situated around  while dogecoin shiba inu and ethereum are soaringwhile shortsighted gamblers like to make bets on the next big dog meme coin it’s important to review the basics of why bitcoin has accrued value and compare bitcoin to other tokensbitcoin is the best monetary goodwhy it has specific credible properties scarce durable portable transactable and so onfrom these properties we can derive two unique characteristicsno counterparty risk no dilution riskthese two characteristics can only be maintained by having the ability to hold your own private keys and run your own full nodeno other coin or token can even compete with bitcoin on these properties and characteristicstherefore no other coin or token can compete with bitcoin as being the best monetary goodlike the invention of the number zero “bitcoin is a pathdependent onetime invention its critical breakthrough is the discovery of absolute scarcity — a monetary property never before and never again achievable by mankind” — robert breedlove “the number zero and bitcoin”the point of money is being able to send wealth through time and space bitcoin’s unique properties enable it to do that better than any other good since money is a winnertakeall network effect–driven good individuals game theoretically converge on bitcoin as a schelling point due to its specific properties and characteristics“each digital value network carries a network effect the strength of which can be approximated by the  value of each shown here as size of circle with accurate scalewith your hardearned money at stake pick which circle others will value most” — croesuswhy do ethereum and other alts have valuefirst eth is a tokenbefore its launch  of eth was premined some of this eth was given to developers but it was mostly distributed to ico investorseth clearly has not and cannot compete with bitcoin on being a monetary good as its monetary policy has and never will be credibly perfect like bitcoininstead eth is “pitched” as a promise to be useful in a variety of different applications since eth is a token and not equity in a corporation the community attempts to create both supply and demand narratives to incentivize speculators to buy and hold the tokenthe eth community must continue to come up with unique narratives that rationalize a reason for holding eth it must continue changing if it wants to bring in new buyerssome of these include demand use cases like issuing  tokens defi nfts and daosother narratives are supply driven like “ultrasound money” where the community has recently started to argue that eth supply could potentially decrease over timethe unethical part of this is some people pitch eth as “ultrasound” money something that is supposedly “better” than bitcointhis idea of eth being “ultrasound” money is scammy and misleadingin fact eth is actually copying the monetary policy of an  token built on eth bomb this token has a monetary policy that dictates that supply will forever declinethe market cap of bomb is  million if eth successfully copies bomb and becomes worth just as much it will trade at  per eth a rather large drawdown from of course since this token has a constantly decreasing supply it should confirm that supply itself or “ultrasound” money does not make a token a good monetary goodunlike bitcoin whose value accrued as a game theory schelling point from the organically decentralized credibly fixed nature of its monetary properties eth’s value is derived from promises and speculationeth must continue changing and promising more applications and usefulness otherwise why hold the token the hope is simply that it becomes more scarce and more in demand forever like most startups and bubbles it’s not the underlying fundamentals that give the asset value it’s the hope andor speculation of what it could becomelike stated above eth is a token it’s useful if you want to use the ethereum blockchain it’s not moneythe eth token is like a chuck e cheese token to use the ethereum blockchaineth’s bestcase scenario there are sustainable longterm useful applications on the ethereum blockchain that are not able to be built on bitcoin or bitcoin second layers don’t require perfect censorship resistance or decentralization average person can’t run an ethereum node and wouldn’t just be more efficient as a product or service offered by a corporationpotential use casesbuy an nft or buy a fortnite skin corporationtrade on defi exchange or trade on binance or coinbase corporationget a defi loan or get a loan from unchained capital blockfi or hodlhodl corporationcasino gambling or speculation eg dogecoin eth and all other altsthe only major use case for a blockchain is money bitcoin for money you need censorship resistance and decentralization in order to have the best credible monetary propertieswith that said even if some of these use cases do play out it doesn’t mean the token eth would accrue valuewhen chuck e cheese launched in  you should have bought equity in the business not their tokenseth and alts are riding bitcoin’s monetizationall alts are riding the success of bitcoin on top of bitcoin’s monetization process unprecedented monetary and fiscal policy leads to a breakdown in the pricing mechanism of “free” financial marketstraditional finance doesn’t understand bitcoin and they bring their idea of diversification to the world of monetary goods not a good idea in addition retail speculators are shortsighted and constantly looking for the next big thing spacs gme dogecoin eth tron etc to get rich quickly they fall for unit bias and chase priceat the end of the day alts fall to the greater fool theory can i sell my token to someone else at a higher pricethe best monetary good bitcoin becomes money and the rest are nothing more than gambling in a casino dogecoin nothing more than a jokememe closing in on ethereum as the number three coin should help shed more light on thatthis is a guest post by mimesis capital opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of btc inc or bitcoin magazine
