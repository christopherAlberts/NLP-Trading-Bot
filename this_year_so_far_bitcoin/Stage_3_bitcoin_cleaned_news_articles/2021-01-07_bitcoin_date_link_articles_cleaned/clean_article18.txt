when it comes to bitcoin im kind of like switzerland im not on either side in the war over the popular cryptocurrencysure i realize that quite a few smart investors are buying bitcoin in large part as a hedge against inflation i also understand why some investors are vehemently opposed to buying bitcoin i say to each his or her owneven if youre a huge fan of bitcoin though you might want to consider another alternative theres a stock thats a better buy novavax nasdaqnvaxbigger winnermost people who buy bitcoin arent doing anything sophisticated like hedging against inflation or betting on the decline of the us dollar theyre in it simply to make a huge return on the coins momentum theres also a fear of missing out you might call these individuals momofomo investorsbut if you wanted to make a massive gain and didnt want to miss out in  novavax was a much bigger winner than bitcoin dont believe me heres the tale of the tapenovavax didnt just outperform bitcoin last year it absolutely trounced the cryptocurrency why investors were fired up early in  about the potential for the biotechs flu vaccine candidate nanoflu novavax reported stellar results for nanoflu in march in a headtohead study against sanofis marketleading flu vaccine fluzone quadrivalentinvestors enthusiasm went through the roof when novavax announced in july that it was receiving  billion in funding for its  vaccine program from the us governments operation warp speed its momentum continued after the biotech reported encouraging results for its experimental coronavirus vaccine the following monthbetter prospectsof course you shouldnt buy bitcoin biotech stocks or anything else only because of their previous performance the future is much more important than the pasti wont pretend to claim i know what the future holds for bitcoin or novavax i do think though that the factors driving novavaxs prospects are clearcut thats not necessarily the case with bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencyif novavaxs coronavirus vaccine  delivers high efficacy along with a solid safety profile the stock should soar again in  if it doesnt the biotechs share price will likely sink its that simpletheres a good reason to be optimistic about novavaxs chances the earlier results for  were so good that several analysts referred to the experimental vaccine as potentially bestinclass novavax has already lined up multiple supply deals for its  vaccine if all goes well the company stands to make a lot of money in a short period of timewe wont have to wait very long to find out how  fared either novavax expects to report initial results from a uk latestage study of the vaccine soon it also began a latestage study in the us and mexico at the end of  results from this study should be on the way in just a few monthsless cryptic than cryptoin some ways novavax and bitcoin are similar theyre both speculative assets that could skyrocket or sink theyre attractive to aggressive investors who want to win big and arent afraid to take on risksbut with novavax its easier to understand exactly why it might move higher or lower the potential drivers behind its success or failure are less cryptic than those behind cryptocurrencymake no mistake about it the potential growth drivers for novavax are compelling the company has a market cap of less than  billion and could have two blockbuster vaccines on the way with  and nanoflu not everyone will agree with me and thats fine but i think the case for novavax over the next year is stronger than the case for bitcoin
