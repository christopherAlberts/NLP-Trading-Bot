consider the bitcoin for your portfoliowhat is bitcoinbitcoin is a type of digital currency but it is unlike other fiat legal currency – the rupee us dollar euro and so on a currency is meant to buy goods and services but unlike normal currencies the bitcoin is available only in digital form it is one of over  cryptocurrencies available in the world todaysource coindcxwhat is a cryptocurrencya cryptocurrency is a virtual currency it is a generic name – bitcoin is like a brand think of cryptocurrency as cola and bitcoin as say pepsi the bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world today a single unit of a cryptocurrency is actually a complex computerized code that cannot be duplicatedwhy do i need a bitcoin in the first place when there is regular currencyour usual currencies are subject to a lot of rules and regulations central banks of various nations govern their currencies they control the exchange rates decide how much money to print and intervene regularly in forex marketsin  after the global credit crisis a need was felt to democratize how currencies are held exchanged and regulated that year an anonymous person under the pseudonym ‘satoshi nakamoto’ invented bitcoin nobody yet knows who and where nakamoto is that was the birth of cryptocurrencies ever since many other cryptocurrencies were invented but bitcoin remains the most popularcryptocurrencies are more democratic you can use them in any part of the world buy as much as you want and use them anywhere there is a network of people and their computers that maintains a ledger any exchange of the cryptocurrency must be validated by all those who are present in the network the ledger then gets updated to reflect the transaction this technology is called blockchainwhat is blockchainblockchain is a technology on which bitcoin – or any other cryptocurrency – works it’s nothing but a sophisticated recordmaintaining system run by several users in a decentralized waywhen a bitcoin is exchanged a block of data an alphanumeric code that signifies the cryptocurrency its quantum and value is created and shared across all the computers or nodes attached to the network think of this block as a series of such transactions once this block is verified a formal record gets entered into the decentralized database for everyone who is on that network to see then when that same bitcoin is sought to be sold again another block gets created the previous transaction or block is not erased the new block gets attached to the old block to form a chain hence the term blockchain for everyone to see the trail this way of record keeping also means that the transaction cannot be reversedso can bitcoin replace our rupeenot so fast for one despite being devised as currencies that should enable you to buy goods and services cryptocurrencies aren’t yet considered legal tender for one many countries including india haven’t legalized the use of cryptocurrencieswhy then has the price of bitcoin gone up so muchthe speculative potential of what bitcoin can become once it finds global government acceptance and become legal tender is a key driver in april  the rbi virtually banned cryptocurrencies and prohibited all regulated entities such as banks from allowing anyone to trade in them so you could no longer transfer funds from your bank account online to a cryptocurrency exchange for buying a bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencybut in march  the supreme court said that such curbs are illegal the supreme court’s ruling makes many believe that eventually cryptocurrency would become legal tenderhigher demand and lower supply lead to higher prices the current stage of bitcoin is one where there is limited supply and a very high demand that is why bitcoin’s price shot up  percent between march  and january the us uk and germany are some countries that allow the use of cryptocurrenciesso what is the danger in making this a legal currency worldwideapart from decentralization and democracy the basic idea of cryptocurrency is that there must be no restrictions or controls cryptocurrencies do not maintain your records when you exchange any cryptocurrency all that gets stored in the decentralized ledger we just told you about is the fact that the currency was exchanged your identity does not get stored buyers and sellers of bitcoin do not get to know each other’s identities hence it’s difficult to tax bitcoin and that is a loss of revenue to the government you can buy almost anything on the dark web without your identity being revealed and that is a real danger in popularizing cryptocurrenciesbut most importantly this anonymity in cryptocurrencies can give rise to terror funding and money laundering there have been many ransomware virus attacks – websites of large companies have been held hostage these cyber criminals demanded cryptocurrencies as ransom so that they wouldn’t be identified or trackednext bitcoinpart  should you invest in this
