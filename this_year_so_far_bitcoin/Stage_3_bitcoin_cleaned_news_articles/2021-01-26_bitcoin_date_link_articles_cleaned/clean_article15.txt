is this the point were at now building mining rigs in odd places just to annoy gamers well heres one guy doing it just to further frustrate people simon byrne has fitted six nvidia rtx  into his bmw  and he says the hybrid car is able to run the rig toothe mining rig spotted by hardwaretimes is fitted into the trunk of the car and can be powered by the cars internal battery it isnt particularly practical however as the boot or trunk for you americans has to remain open or else the whole thing overheatsbut its not about being practical so says byrne its about aggravating gamers apparently toms hardware reached out to byrne to check the system was real and operational and byrne responded saying indeed just to annoy gamershe also claims to have visions of a utopian world run by cryptocurrency although what sort of utopia involves spite building mining rigs in the boot of your car i dont knowthe mining rig comes in rather shy of the  rtx  mining farm that byrne also operates all fitted with the same pny graphics cardstheres undoubtedly new pressure from bots on graphics card supply not only to resell for a profit but to build cryptocurrency mining rigs similarly there have been reports of bulk sales further down the supply chain for use in mining farms meaning fewer cards end up reaching retail the impact of either of these practices is not precisely known and with ongoing component shortages also playing a large part in shortages its tough to see the wood from the trees as to a root causeits not an easy time to buy graphics cards and once again were seeing some hit from the recent price increase of bitcoin the cryptocoin is extremely volatile however and can seemingly crash overnight shaving thousands off its value its also once again raised the ire of regulators who would like to see crypto come under governanceâ€”a bit of a nightmare scenario for some
