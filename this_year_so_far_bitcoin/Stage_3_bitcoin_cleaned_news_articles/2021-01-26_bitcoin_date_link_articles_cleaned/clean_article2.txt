institutional investors diving into bitcoin — namely hedge funds — are eager to promote its unpredictable price swings as the sign of a new asset class in the making the cryptocurrency has traded at between  and  over the past year and arguing over its true value is like a scholastic spat about angels on a pin could it go to six figures seven is it actually worth nothing at all the mystery only adds to its allurethe speculative digital gold rush is understandable in this pandemic environment of easy money and widespread daytrader fomo but it’s notable that the nonvirtual side of bitcoin buying — namely the energy consumption needed to mine and maintain it — gets far less attention instead crypto is regularly lumped in with energytransition trades such as tesla inc another top retailinvestor pick regardless of the fact that buying bitcoin pretty clearly makes an investment portfolio “less green as barclays private bank’s gerald moser put it last weekthe bitcoin algorithm demands increasing amounts of computational power to validate transactions if it were a country its annualized estimated carbon footprint would be comparable to new zealand at about  million tons of carbon dioxide one bitcoin transaction would generate the  equivalent to  swipes of a visa credit card according to digiconomist’s closelyfollowed index albeit with none of the convenience of plastic add in bitcoin’s primary use as a speculative instrument and the frequent regulatory warnings it draws and it’s hard to imagine it ever scoring high on esgenergy estimates aren’t an exact science but the direction of travel for power consumption has been clear bitcoin’s annual consumption is estimated at around  terawatthours up from  terawatthours in  according to digiconomist another index compiled by the cambridge center for alternative finance estimates a higher figure of around  terawatthours the economics of mining outpaced the average laptop long ago with firms like marathon patent group inc now buying tens of thousands of specialized chips at once to power their crypto farmsit would be one thing if this were taking place in say sweden which has a carbon tax of more than  euros per metric ton of  with exemptions or within the european union’s carbon emissions trading system with prices at around  euros per metric ton but one paper suggests almost half of the world’s bitcoin mining capacity is situated in southwest china where power is cheap less taxed and supplied by coalfired plants as well as hydroelectricity the cambridge center for alternative finance estimates coal accounts for  of miner powerthe defense from bitcoiners is that this is still “good overall this is energy that would otherwise be wasted and the share of renewables will grow the siberian city of norilsk for example now hosts the arctic’s first crypto farm it’s made from scrap metal kept cool by subzero temperatures and powered by cheap gas and hydropower from mining company the traditional kind mmc norilsk nickel pjscbut these arguments ring hollow cheap power usually comes with other costs consider recent power blackouts in iran that were blamed on bitcoin even ray dillinger part of the early digitalcash movement that spawned cryptocurrencies recently said bitcoin had wasted “enormous resources of energy on the back of taxpayersubsidized electricity with the encouragement of exactly the sort of authoritarian governments it claimed to fight against a  paper by academics at dublin city university trinity college dublin and university of southampton found cryptocurrency trading appeared to have influence on the pricing in large electricity and utilities marketsnot all cryptocurrencies need energyhungry proofofwork algorithms but bitcoin wouldn’t go back on its founding rules without a fight that rigidity is promoted as a feature and not a bug fidelity digital assets’ defense of bitcoin’s energy inefficiency for example is that it gets you bitcoin in returndoing so would also mean shelving the usual false equivalences bitcoiners draw with supposedly worse wasters of energy such as central governments unlike governments the closest bitcoin gets to redistribution of wealth is celebritysponsored giveaways which are at worst predatory hoaxes and at best promotional corporate stunts that offer  worth of cryptocurrency to people clearly desperate for far more help mine the stuff with a highend computer and get the chance to heat your greenhouse as wellresearchers have suggested that alternatives to a carbon tax could include more direct taxation of mining — though with a high likelihood of chasing such activities awaywhat would bitcoin really be worth if in order to care for the world it set out to revolutionize it changed its algorithm or if miners unhooked themselves from cheap power that’s a real price mysterylionel laurent is a bloomberg opinion columnist covering the european union and france he worked previously at
