for all the talk about bitcoin and broadly crypto being easier to buy than ever before friday morning as bitcoin was topping  per coin i spent hours trying to make a small  purchaseaccording to some the latest rally was initiated by institutional investors looking for a hedge against fiat inflation and the us dollar’s decline in foreign exchange markets and they seem to be having no problem buying – the price has shot up  in less than a monthbut if my experience is an example of what other retail investors are dealing with there’s still plenty of frustration to be had with the crypto markets and think how much higher the price could be if all these newbie investors could get their hands on some of that sweet sweet digital goldtransaction declinedthis maddening adventure into purchasing more bitcoin to hodl started not as panic that i was going to miss out no i’ve been in the space since late  and have seen the majority of the bull runs and bear markets i am in no hurry to buy at the topbut i was using this revival as a time to set up recurring purchases with these mainstream mobile apps that are touting easy crypto buying as the technology maturesi started with square’s cash app an application i’ve used plenty loading money into my account to then take advantage of the boosts like  off any coffeeshop purchase but when trying to set up a biweekly purchase of bitcoin i got the “something went wrong” error message what though what the hell went wrong stock purchases were also declinedsubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policyok no problem i’ve had a coinbase account for many years and have purchased crypto with that account so that should be an easy buy except that it wasn’t after updating my card details from an old debit card i put in a buy order that was promptly declinedfor fk’s sakenext i tried blockchaincom what was probably my first bitcoin wallet ever besides a paper wallet that transaction was denied based on my residence being in new york where they don’t operate thanks a lot bitlicensehow about gemini then where just a couple weeks ago i purchased some defi tokens on the first try the purchase was declined because the market moved so the displayed price had changed i tried again – begrudgingly because the fees on a  transaction were nearly  – and a couple seconds later received an email “success your buy order is complete”finally except wait nope  minutes later i received another email stating the transfer failed and the buy order was not completedfailed buy order  frustration bailey reutzelmaybe all these services are overwhelmed by demand both coinbase and kraken suffered outages this week during the runrobinhood was next i was instructed to deposit money into my account before i could buy but after putting my routing and account number in the app stated my financial institution is not supported robinhood seems to be using plaid for connecting bank accountsbinanceus didn’t work either again on the basis of not doing business with customers residing in new york i tried inputting my parent’s address in the midwest which allowed me a first level of verification but to buy bitcoin you need to go through the advanced verification requiring a picture of a bank statement or utility bill my driver’s license still shows my former midwest address but that wasn’t a sufficient form of verification at this stagelastly it dawned on me that paypal just began allowing crypto purchases so i logged into my account while a button on the homepage said “discover bitcoin” when i clicked it it took me to my dashboard which had no clear way to buy bitcoin by this time i was fuming and called a friend to have him check his ability to purchase he was able to buy in secondsso now i’m thinking that i’m on some kind of blacklist maybe harping on how banks suck and crypto companies that play by traditional finance’s rules are selling out has finally caught up with mebut after some troubleshooting i realized it was because my paypal account is a business account pretty arbitrarily really so i went through the process of setting up a separate individual account which i had to link to a random burner email account from that individual account dashboard the “buy bitcoin” button was right up front and so i put through an order and received a note that my transaction had gone throughbut for anyone not interested in carrying out all these different setups for the story this kind of process is infuriating and i’d assume any novice crypto buyer would have given up after the second rejectionthe main problemwhich brings me to what appears to be the real issue – my traditional financial institutioni bank with a state credit union in colorado after trying these various routes to “financial freedom” i called its customer service line i’ve had to call it before to open up payments applications such as zelle so i figured i’d just need to tell it to take the blocks off my account i’ve bought crypto in the past using this bankbranded debit cardbut after being on hold the customer service agent told me all crypto transactions are “considered very high risk” and declines them no matter whether i assure them it’s a transaction i want to make or notshe told me to contact each of the companies directly and see if there was another way to make a purchase – for instance i could maybe pay directly out of my checking account – but when trying to input my account details before the credit union didn’t seem to be supportedthis new risk aversion to anything cryptorelated is strange the bitcoin industry has matured substantially and in many enthusiasts’ eyes running towards  per coin means the incumbents the status quo the powers that be have no choice but to take us seriously nowthat doesn’t appear to be the case
