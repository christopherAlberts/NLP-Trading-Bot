in this photo illustration a visual representation of the digital cryptocurrency bitcoin is displayed on april   in paris franceis bitcoin too risky for the average investorcompared to most investments bitcoin is a highly volatile highly risky investment james ledbetter editor of fintech newsletter fin and cnbc contributor tells cnbc make it if you look historically at the price of bitcoin there have been a number of occasions where its really spiked and then comes crashing down really quickly for example after rallying to nearly  in  bitcoins price collapsed and lost a third of its value in a single day and in  it dropped to as low as  wiping out billions of dollars from the total cryptocurrency market value while that can mean big returns it can also mean big losses thats why some like investor mark cuban liken bitcoin to gambling and advise investing only as much money as you can afford to lose you have to at least be mentally prepared and financially prepared that  could happen again it could happen tomorrow ledbetter says of course despite its high selling price you can go and buy as little as even  of bitcoin because there is the ability to buy fractional shares called satoshis points out anthony pompliano cofounder of cryptocurrency hedge fund morgan creek digital assets and a bitcoin investor just start very small do research learn about it pompliano says if you do decide to invest pompliano supports holding bitcoin longterm by design there is a limited supply of bitcoin so bitcoin bull pompliano believes as demand increases the price will as wellare bitcoin wallets safein july a widespread twitter hack compromised many celebrity accounts – including that of presidentelect joe biden former president barack obama and tesla ceo elon musk to name a few – in a bitcoin scam as a result hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin had been transferred under false pretenses for many this prompted questions around the safety of bitcoin there have been multiple examples of bitcoin theft and fraud that i think would give pause to the average investor particularly if you were going to invest a substantial amount i think those are legitimate fears ledbetter says but he also finds them overblown while bitcoin allows for users to transact without revealing personal information or identity potentially making fraud easier its not totally anonymous each bitcoin transaction is documented on a digital ledger called the blockchain where a users cryptocurrency wallet is represented as a unique series of random numbers and letters through this a scammer could potentially be traced after the fact i always remind people that bitcoin literally has a public ledger pompliano says plus bitcoin is extremely hard to hack thanks to blockchain to hack it you would have to take over the network and to take over the network you would need your own network of computers running  and to do that it would cost billions of dollars according to paul vigna markets reporter at the wall street journal ledbetter also points out that a traditional stock account with a brokerage could be compromised too theres always some potential for fraud or security risk the safest bet is to use a trusted brokerage experts say – these established places have a good security protocol and a quick application to protect ledbetter says all in all things happen he says but when you look at the big stories of theft they tend to be institutional and kind of on the fringes according to the federal trade commission ftc website cryptocurrency scams are a popular way for scammers to trick people into sending money and most scams can appear as emails trying to blackmail someone online chain referral schemes or bogus investment and business opportunities its not like theres something intrinsically unsafe about bitcoin itself– its more how people are handling or managing it ledbetter sayscan bitcoin be easily converted to fiat and transferredcurrently most mainstream bitcoin transactions are done by converting bitcoin to fiat currency like the us dollar for instance paypal announced that in  consumers will be able to use cryptocurrency as a funding source for purchases but what that really means is when a user pays with bitcoin it will be instantly converted to fiat currency and the transaction will be settled with the paypal merchants in fiat currency according to paypals website and as of now that process of transferring bitcoin to other accounts and converting it to different currencies whether the us dollar or other cryptocurrency is clunky and time consuming says ledbetterplus if youre using bitcoin for transactions you really need to read the fine print – there are usually fees associated with those transactions but some of that will probably ease up a little bit over time ledbetter says along with fees sellers do not have the confidence to do large transactions yet in bitcoin investor kevin oleary chairman of oshares etfs told pompliano on the pomp podcast in december im sure this could change over time but not today in the future pompliano predicts innovation will result in technology that makes it easier to spend bitcoin with quicker transactions that are cheaper more efficient more usableis bitcoin a bubblecan bitcoin be used as a hedge against inflation
