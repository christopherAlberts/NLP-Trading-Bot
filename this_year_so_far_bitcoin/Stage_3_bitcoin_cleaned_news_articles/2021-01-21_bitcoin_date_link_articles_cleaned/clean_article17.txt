london uk jan   globe newswire  many people often link bitcoin to gold it is because many perceive both as being a safe investment despite being similar due to gold and bitcoin being finite resources they also differ in many ways such as physicality and volatility of the price the article reveals an exert from the soon to be released book bitcoin simplified by naseeff ramzi in which the author discusses the intricacies and complexities of the mechanisms behind bitcoin that have been attributed to its success the book is highly anticipated especially from the followers of the blog youtube channel social media and the content on the websitebitcoin and gold alike are sourced through mining however mining gold is very different from mining bitcoin gold is located and excavated from the ground and then forged in flames bitcoin is created by computers solving complex equations many refer to this as bitcoin mining and although these processes comparatively differ they share some common ground bitcoin is regarded as the decades best investment whereas gold is considered one of the safest investmentsas previously mentioned gold and bitcoin are limited in supply they are finite resources the prime derivative of price and appeal to investors is mining them to increase circulation thus influencing market value looking at the sustained growth and establishment of these markets it is evident that both gold and cryptocurrencies will continue to grow and amount value for the foreseeable future bitcoin connects people via the internet anywhere in the world the blockchain model and coding behind bitcoin uses cryptography computer science and mathematics to protect electronic communication and ensure coins cannot be copied or forged the same way one cannot copy goldunlike gold and physical cash one can trade and receive bitcoin instantaneously without restriction both gold and bitcoin share the trait of finiteness meaning no individual can conjure anymore into existence the bitcoin market cap is over  billion £ billion at this moment in time bitcoins price is currently around  £ which is an ath alltimehigh the daily volume for bitcoin is  billion £ billion in tracked exchanges many believe that bitcoins market cap will become hundreds of trillions in years to come and this has resulted in an exponential increase in bitcoins recent price driven by increased purchasing it has many people investing with the prospects of making a great return on investment within a couple of years comparatively the gold market is at  trillion £ trillion and the daily volume of exchanges is estimated to be around  billion £ billion to  billion £ billion a daythe total amount of bitcoin that can be mined is capped at  million the coding behind bitcoin is programmed so that it gets harder to mine over time there is a smaller reward per mathematical equation that is solved but how much bitcoin has been mined already around  million bitcoins are in circulation now it means that about  of all bitcoin has gone through the mining process already when a mathematical equation is solved miners receive bitcoin as a reward the amount of bitcoin issued upon solving an equation is the reward per block the reward is cut down in half per block every four years this occurs every  blocks blocks go through mining on an average one every  minutes the figure remains consistent because the coding behind these equations is a selfadjusting mechanism which self regulates the rate it solves the equationsdue to the diminishing rate of bitcoin mining the last of it will be in  recent data states that approximately  tonnes of gold have been mined and exists above ground today and at least  tonnes get mined a year but it is unknown how much of the mining remainsanother key difference between gold and bitcoin is how it is stored gold is not convenient to store and can easily be stolen or lost bitcoin can be stored in a digital wallet hosted by various online services capable of storing bitcoin safely meaning no one can steal it however if passwords are lost one cannot recover the bitcoin even though most gold investors store gold in secure vaults there will be an everpresent threat of thefta key aspect to consider is that gold has been used as currency and for trading for over  years whereas bitcoin has only been in existence since january  within  years bitcoin has earned the title of being a nationally recognized safehaven asset within a decade bitcoins introduction and impact have echoed throughout the trading industry and will continue to shape the future of economics as we know itthe chart compares the price of gold and bitcoin before it hit its peak in december  that is when bitcoin reached its alltime high the graph demonstrates that golds value slowly and consistently increases throughout the year around the same rate at which the value of money appreciates conclusively it is a safe asset to invest in however now consider the rate at which bitcoins value has increased the data illustrates a  increase within one financial year from  in  to over  in  it is a clear indication that over this period bitcoin was a significantly more profitable investmentnot everyone can invest in gold because billions of people worldwide lack access to banking infrastructure but to access and buy bitcoin all that is needed is a connection to the internetbitcoin came in place to tackle these issues by sending value across the globe with near enough no fees both bitcoin and gold have very liquidated markets which many can trade with fiat money gold is more of a safe asset to invest in as bitcoins price is highly volatile as seen when bitcoins price went from less than  £ to over  £ in just one year however volatility works both ways because bitcoins price dropped in  to around £ and slowly started to risepeople often view bitcoin as gold  since they both share very similar properties neither require an authoritative governing body to operate and have associated value and both have limited supply if curious about the similarities and differences between gold fiat and bitcoin refer to the chart
