interest in bitcoin “doublespending” grew after recent news that the bitcoin network processed the same bitcoin btc in two transactions – the very “doublespending” scenario bitcoin was specifically designed to preventexcept the doublespend didn’t happen at least not in the traditional sense“the bitcoin ‘doublespend’ media headline has certainly spooked investors but it’s a misunderstanding of how the bitcoin network operates in this case a chain reorganization of one block occurred which is a fairly common occurrence” jason lau coo of okcoin exchange told coindeskput another way no bitcoin was “doublespent” because no new coins were added to bitcoin’s supply instead the same coins from the same wallet were registered in two different blocks during a typical split in bitcoin’s blockchainthe reason this does not qualify as a doublespend is because only one of these transactions the one recorded on bitcoin’s longest blockchain history is considered valid by the network while the bitcoin in the other transaction cannot be spent because the network does not consider it validwhat is a bitcoin block reorganizationdue to the distributed and highly competitive nature of bitcoin mining mining pools from time to time mine the same block simultaneously and thus cause a split in the blockchain’s history when this happens both blocks will have miners add on to them until one history wins out over the othersubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policylet’s say for instance mining pool a and mining pool b mine a block at the same time resulting in two different blockchain histories versions a and b going forward all other miners have to choose which version of the chain to build on let’s say the miner who finds the next block in the sequence chooses to build on version a but then afterwards the next two or three or more miners decide to build on version b version b ultimately wins out as more miners choose to mine that transaction historythe other history is excised from the network and considered irrelevant and any blocks mined on it become stale blocksthis was the case at block  wherein two blocks were spawned by separate mining pools and a oneblock reorganization as described by lau occurred the above scenario is why satoshi nakamoto said in the white paper that a transaction should only be considered final after it has six confirmations ie six new blocks are mined onto the chain that has recorded the transactionno a doublespend didn’t really happenthe supposed doublespend first became news yesterday after bitmex research reported on block ’s abnormalities on twitter the reorganization meant a “stale block” also sometimes called an “orphan block” had been mined that contained bitcoin also spent on bitcoin’s valid chain so a transaction containing the same bitcoin was recorded on both the relevant and irrelevant chainswhat bitmex research called at first a “doublespendlike scenario” now looks like a perfect storm caused by the one block reorg and a replacebyfee transaction a rbf transaction occurs when you tell your wallet to send the same bitcoin again but with a higher fee with the hopes that it will be confirmed before the lower fee transactionheres what actually happenedit went down like this someone sent  btc to this address but set the lowest fee possible  satoshi per byte or less than a fraction of a cent per byte of transaction datasince the fee was so low the transaction took a while to confirm so the sender tried to outpace it by sending what’s called a “replace by fee transaction” rbfinstead of the rbf replacing the slow transaction as intended however the lower fee transaction cleared first and made it into the block that was mined onto the longest chainmeanwhile the higher fee transaction found its way onto the stale block the final result  btc is recorded as existing on the address  on the irrelevant transaction history while  btc exists on the same address but on the relevant transaction ledgera flow chart of the conflicting transactions adapted by bitmex research from an image originally produced by  bitmex researchthe importance of  confirmationstechnically the same bitcoin was spent twice in this scenario but one transaction was doublespent to an address on a transaction history that the bitcoin network does not consider valid if you query the transaction id for the “losing” transaction in any bitcoin block explorer for instance nothing comes up“it’s kinda a doublespend but not really normally a doublespend refers to when you intentionally replace a transaction that sends money to someone with one that sends it to your own wallet” ben carman a bitcoin core contributor and developer at suredbits told coindeskin this scenario “the important thing to know is that yes there might be different versions of the same transaction but only  will ultimately be accepted” by nodes and users of the bitcoin network coin metrics bitcoin network data analyst lucas nuzzi wrote on twittera doublespend typically means a sender tricks a recipient into accepting a transaction that the sender actually sends to itself as well this is why it’s considered best practice for merchants to wait for six confirmations before a payment is considered final to avoid an outcome like this one it’s worth noting that in this instance though no reported fraud took place because the sender and the recipient are probably the same entity
