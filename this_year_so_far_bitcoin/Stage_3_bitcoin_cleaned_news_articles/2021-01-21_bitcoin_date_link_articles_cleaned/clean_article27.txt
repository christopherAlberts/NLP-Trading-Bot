cryptocurrencies may never be able to work as actual currencies according to ubs global wealth managementthe “fundamental flaw inherent in cryptocurrencies is that supply can’t be reduced when demand is slumping in most cases paul donovan chief economist at ubs gwm said in a video this week that means they can’t be considered currencies he saida “proper currency as donovan termed it can be a stable store of value providing certainty that it will be able to buy the same basket of goods tomorrow as it buys today that confidence is derived from central banks’ ability to reduce supply when demand is falling there is no such mechanism for switching off supply on most cryptocurrencies and therefore their value can slide  leading to a collapse in spending power“people are unlikely to want to use something as a currency if they’ve got absolutely no certainty about what they can buy with that tomorrow donovan said in the videobitcoin futures are listed on the chicago mercantile exchange alongside contracts for most major currencies but the difference in daily trading volumes suggest that some investors haven’t yet embraced the crypto as a fully fledged currency amid the  price plunge for bitcoin on thursday transactions for the january futures were just above  while there were around six times as many for japanese yen futuresthis story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text only the headline has been changedsubscribe to mint newsletters  enter a valid email  thank you for subscribing to our newsletter
