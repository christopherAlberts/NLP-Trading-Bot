you have probably heard the terms defi which is an abbreviation for decentralized finance and nfts meaning nonfungible tokens they have been covered in the news a great deal in the past month or more so i wanted to do an episode where we do a deep dive into these topics to find out not just what they are but what they might mean for the future of financemy next guest on the fintech one•on•one

 shows but i didn’t want to edit it down because i feel like what we covered here is really importantwe’re talking about two of the hottest topics in fintech right now and that is decentralized finance or defi and nonfungible tokens nfts now we go into each of these in some depth we provide examples of how to get started what it really means for not just fintech but for the broader economy and also lex provide his perspective on where he thinks these two really hot trends are going it was a truly fascinating interview hope you enjoy the showwelcome to the podcast lexlex sokolin thanks for having me my pleasurepeter okay so let’s just started with giving the listeners a little bit of background about yourself and we were chatting earlier you’re living in the uk have been for many years why don’t you give us a little bit of background before you got to consensyslex sure so i’ve got a lot of new york in me now a little bit of london and i also have a little bit of moscow for sort of a secret agenda you never know peter laughs but i’ve kind of hit up different parts of the world but really grew up in new york and considered that my home new york has a gravity to it and so that gravity is wall street as many immigrant kids got pulled towards wall street and so started out at lehman brothers and in  in a strategy function for the wealth management asset management business i kind of got trained up on an analytical skill set thinking about money and was very fortunate i think to have the crash happen very quicklyfortunate for two reasons the first is it didn’t really affect me deeply i was just an analyst associate a couple of years out of school and then also i didn’t miss it i didn’t miss the experience of being in the  crash i think it was such a rich experience that many people who graduated in  or  or  would benefit from seeing a real nice meltdown and everything that gave me permission to separate from wall street and do my first startup around i was at columbia at that time and so buffered myself with government loans and it subsidized…robo advice discovery and kind of ideation so i started a company called nestegg wealth which was  robo very quickly turned into a private label digital wall platform which is now called advisorengine we raised about  million from wisdomtree and sold to franklin templeton last yearand so i spent a chunky amount of time in digital wealth and kind of thinking about personal finance how people hold assets how they invest why they do it the behavioral bits around it and then sort of dove head first into the financial advisor value chain and so you start talking about data and custody and trading rebalancing and equities and fixed income and intermediation and the whole sort of machine the whole factory of how actually the investing side of finance worksaround  i left the company and wanted to really look around and go deeper and joined an equity research firm called autonomous research to start their frontier technology kind of fintech practice and so…most of the work there was about yelling at hedge fund managers who allocate large checks to traditional financial services companies about how everything they’re doing is doomed none of their investments will work and google would have destroyed all of it and so it was good rhetorical practice because i feel like you can’t really persuade people using normal words in that environmentthe additional advantage of the work i did at autonomous was basically three years of thinking across the industries getting out of wealth to banking and lending and payments and insurance and seeing the same structural pattern repeat there’s no difference between a wealth tech platform and a digital lending private label platform and a bankingasaservice private label platform and then if you melt that down to apis it’s all the same stuff underneath as well in terms of just from a macro perspective of what it’s doing to the industryand then the other dimension is the actual things that are novel like the platform shifts that matter and so putting advisors or bankers or underwriters or carriers or whatever it is into a phone that’s nice in a way so we did that it’s over there’s no point anymore in the sense of like it’ll continue to happen but it’s not where the innovation is really bubbling up and so if you think about that as distribution the question is what is left to do in finance and what hasn’t been donethat’s really what’s taken me to blockchain and programmable blockchains as a theme i think is completely fundamental to what the financial services industry will look like sort of the punch line there is financial manufacturing but let me pause before i go down the rabbit holepeter okay lex why don’t we go down for a little bit just tell us exactly what you do at consensyslex so i joined consensys about two years ago now i do a couple of things there with the main one being to colead our fintech group called consensys codefi which is a product development group responsible for building software products around digital assets to organization decentralized finance stablecoins really you name it the intersection between large financial institutions  users of crypto networks everything that relates to enabling these actors financially helping them figure out how to use decentralized finance helping them figure out what it means to have blockchainbased currencies to have financial infrastructure that’s something that we do at consensys codefii also spent quite a bit of time leading the marketing team for the firm as a whole and then thinking about tokenization token launches and economics for the sector so it’s a little bit of a war salad but this is such a broad space and that’s why i’m really attracted to itpeter right right let’s go right into it i want to first talk about defi decentralized finance and i want to dig fairly deep in here i’d love to get your take firstly let’s just start with how do you define it particularly for lay peoplelex it’s a lovely word peter laughs it’s a lovely word decentralized finance you know is decentralized good is decentralized bad are you conservative or are you liberal or are you a libertarian or are you an anarchist it’s a catchall phrase the same way that fintech is a casual phrase i think of it really as financial infrastructure that sits on programmable blockchains but i am also a finance geek and kind of an industry insider and so i overcomplicate the answerthe first flip that you want to do for defi is separate out the asset class so the thing that you invest in the thing that you want to own the token the security whatever it is right so there are…like bitcoin is an asset class crypto currency is an asset class so within defi there are things that you can buy that represent exposure to something let’s say to some economic activity so there is a bunch of assets there in defi that’s largely why people are enjoying flooding into it it’s just to get access to the returns from projects early stage venture style projects in defithe second related but different point is that defi is a financial middleware it just happens to be correctly made like i don’t know if this is a personal point of view or this is a consensys point of view but once you sort of grock that blockchains are where computing is going to happen meaning you know we’ve gone from large warehouses doing computational work to personal computers to then laptops to then…the internet has cloud and the cloud runs programs and then your mobile phone is really your window into a gigantic cloud and the cloud executes the software and you access it through your phone and the next computing paradigm is we all run nodes of a network that agrees on a collective truth and executes software against itso once you understand that the next computing paradigm is programmable blockchains defi starts to make sense as just financial software on these programmable blockchains and then because you know programs speak to each other they’re not written in different languages they are not on paper they are not across different standards and so you have fixed income and insurance and asset management and payments all written in the same language and in the same standards you knowso in the traditional world you would think of a card network like a visa has almost nothing in common in terms of its infrastructure with private equity investment shop kkr which has nothing in common with the infrastructure of something like tradeweb and fixed income electronic trading which has nothing in common with the value stack represented by investnet or assetmark for portfolio managementin defi it does it’s all the same it’s all just software and etherium and it does all of these things across the different functions you know and you can look at a super app like ant financial and it is obvious that these functions are distributed together consumers use payments and lending and banking and savings and insurance together because no human being cares at all about the separation between these products unless you work for a regulatorand now from a manufacturing perspective the factory that makes these financial products they also now do not care at all what asset class they’re making they’re just software on a computer and so for me you know if i go back to the sort of break between there’s the asset class the things that the factory makes and then there’s the factory itself you know i’m endlessly encouraged and motivated by the factory because it is the google or spotify moment for the financial industry right nowpeter right right okay so let’s just talk about getting started in defi over the last couple of months i’ve sort of educated myself i would say a working knowledge about having a metamask wallet which is like i believe the consensys made wallet and i’ve got an aave account and a compound account and also also own those tokens separately which is totally obviously separate to what the defi investment is and i bought some dai on aave and compound and a bunch of other things and i’ve been getting my returns coming inso this is one aspect to defi which is the lending aspect and i am lending my dai now to someone getting a return on it but is that sort of …there’s a lot of listeners who do not have anywhere near the knowledge that you have is it smart sort of onramp to getting started in defi pretty typical or how do you recommend people to get startedlex i think the first kind of conceptual shift that you need to make is because the space is now like an expanding fractile it’s very complex at the edges and it’s only going to be more complex at the edges things don’t go back they’ll go forward i think the first step is just to understand what exactly is going on with blockchainbased finance before even going to pick a name and buy it you can have apple and gs and bark and db as stock names and similarly if you were to throw  acronyms from the sp  at people they’ll be like this is all nonsensethat’s a reasonable reaction to when you see a print of defi tickers but it’s no different than if you were to see a list of any other financial tickers so i think the first step is just like why is my experience so different here what is going on you know and the analogy that i default to is this concept of the wallet if you have a physical wallet in your pocket and there’s some cash in it you walk around there’s cash in your wallet maybe there’s some cards in there the cards do different stuffthey might be loyalty cards or they might be credit cards they might have your identity on there you might have keys in your pocket as well so you’re walking around with this physical wallet and you go to a store when you go to a store the store doesn’t hold your wallet you know you go to a starbucks they don’t hold your wallet you take out your wallet from your pocket and you give them your card into their payment processor and they charge you and on your way you go and they don’t get to keep your wallet once you leavein the internet world that’s really changed quite a bit so if you go to amazon or if you go to any retailer these days what happens is that that retailer has a locker and in that locker is all your stuff you leave your credit cards in every store you go to they’re just there in their locker and then you also give them a bunch of other stuff like your identity you know so imagine you walked into a starbucks and they said hey great to see you give us your name and password to open your locker so that we can take your money out and it’s just like a crazy paradigm if you think about it that wayand so the blockchainbased finance approached does it reverses it back when you again have a wallet that the stores do not and this goes back to the defi protocol question which is compound and aave and the rest of these companies they don’t have your account they don’t have your money in the same sense that a bank account does or that amazon does when you give it your payment information with a bank account it literally has your money sitting on the bank balance sheetwhat is happening in the defi sense is that you the user have a metamask wallet installed what the wallet really does is it gives you access to a particular location an address on the blockchain so it stores and encrypts your access to it which is like a key it’s actually called a key and then you’re the one holding that key and that is what gives you control over what happens to the money that’s maintained by this network and then when you come to aave or compound or dai or makerdao or yearn any of these other projects they’re like a little vending machinethey perform a transformation function it’s a little map robot and they ask you…well you have to click on a button first that says i want to give you this right like i want to put the coin into the pinball machine i want to buy a coke in one case it might be i want to put a bunch of my money into a box and get another type of money out i want to collateralize this black box with eth and i want to get a usd cash equivalent account and there’s a mathematical transformation function that allows you to do that and that’s makerdao and dai all of these defi protocols are centrally these little robots that you can take money out of your pocket or out of your portfolio permission them to access it and then permission them to do stuff to that moneyand so i just want to kind of open up that paradigm shift that really gives authority and power back to the user over their assets i think the adjacent question is like well what should you invest in what should you do i think there are some basic functions that have been developed the ones that you described are a great starting pointso number one is put in collateral into a box and get a us dollar stablecoin cash equivalent another primitive would be take an asset and receive an interest rate on it for lending it out or borrow an asset at some interest rate this is like a margin desk it’s not borrowing and lending in the sense of underwriting risk it’s in the sense of somebody wants to go long and short so it’s just like a morgan stanley or goldman sachs capital markets desk and so you can get an interest rate on giving your asset for somebody to borrow and pay you for from there there are more complex things as wellthere is stuff that looks a lot like asset management or like a big fixed income fund where a community of people make investment decisions on your behalf and they might be maximizing interest rates they might be maximizing usage reward which are called “farming” and so you might hop in and provide money into what’s called the “vault” but really looks like a fund and then i think another one that bears talking about is providing liquidity which is essentially allowing you to act as an institutional market maker where you’re putting money into a box that people trade against so you’re sort of like the market maker on a stock exchange floor but you’re doing this again through codeand so those are the ones that have been the most popular of course trading is enabled insurance is enabled as well so we’re really sort of at the edge of that unfolding complexity that i started talking aboutpeter right right yeah it is super interesting because…the thing that struck me…i remember when i first bought ripple it was like back in  or  and it took me all weekend to figure out how just to buy it what i was struck with the metamask wallet is it’s really no more difficult than applying for a bank account it’s easier actually and you’ve got a chrome plugin that you could just go and do iti was surprised when i went to this other site to sort of recognize that i have a metamask wallet it was really simple but i think it seems to me that right now it’s really crypto enthusiasts that are really creating metamask wallets and other types of wallets what’s it going to take to get it more into the mainstream where someone who might have a  and it’s invested in the stock market knows nothing about finance what’s it going to take for them to get a wallet using some of the defi featureslex so a couple of things on that as you can tell brevity is not a virtue that i have peter laughspeter it’s okaylex you know so the first point is like people love to hate on the crypto user experience but i agree with you and i think that the crypto user experience at this point is very much on par with  fintech because many fintech entrepreneurs are now in the crypto space and have just recreated what was once novel and interesting and now it’s delivered through goldman sachs marcus to millions of people you know they’ve recreated on top of the blockchain paradigm and the other day i had to fill out wire instructions…you know this was an electronic experience i was on a bank website i was typing in where the money was going and i had to put in the bank account and bank number of the destination and it felt like a totally insane momenti mean this is a small thing people have had much worse experience with wires and getting them over the line but like i had to go to a pdf and then the routing number was on the pdf and i can copy the number once and then i put that into the first field that says account number and then the second field confirms that the account number is real so i have to type it you know i can’t copy paste it in there so i have to type it and so i’m typing a nine digit bank account number from memory from what i’m seeing and comparing it to a pdfif it matches the first field then it’s good and that’s that that’s the security and it is so unbelievably awkward and error prone and this is why we have settlement issues and reconciliation issues and why literally thousands of people in finance wake up everyday to match one excel file to another and say these are the breaks our firm has to pay millions of dollars to reconcile thatwith metamask like you might be initially put off by the fact that you have this long hash which is your address and you have to copy it around and paste it in different places but it’s unbelievably easy you press on the number and it copies it and then you paste it somewhere and you’re done and it’s never wrong from a user experience it’s really …i think we’re over the hump the second point around how do we get more normal regular people into it is i do think it’s worth pausing on whether that is still a true concern we know that coinbase has  billion in aum or let’s say in custodied assets and about  million users so  million out of  is a pretty good market penetration for the united states it’s an amazingly high numberand as a robo advisor entrepreneur it dawns on me now that it was never a betterment it was always coinbase the robo advisor was never a betterment you know and i love betterment i have nothing but respect for them i think they’re ethical and they execute super well in all this stuff we’ll put wealthfront to the side but they’ve got  billion or so of passive asset allocation and coinbase is going to go public at  billion it was always about the novelty and the next generation there and so i think the actual adoption is much higher than some of us who’ve been in the space for a while feeland then when you look even at mathematics squishes inside of decentralized finance sort of explosion our monthly average users are now at  million per month these are people who every month use the wallet two and a half million of actives is pretty high it’s pretty pretty high even when you compare it to the robinjoods and the chimes and so on we’re going to print you the  million users but you look at the actives and it’s roughly comparable so it feels to me that we are now in the…i think we’re past the early adopters i think we’re passed the… just the crypto geeks and i think for the basic functions of accessing ethereum may be holding nfts may be holding the defi tokens i do think we have that adoptionpeter yeahlex there’s still more to do i think a lot of that will be done from the offramps so coinbase and finance extending into the programmability but i think there is a lot of progress alreadypeter i should also point out you can get coinbase at their own wallet which you can use in some of these defi applications as well you don’t have to use metamask i want to switch gears and talk about nfts you just mentioned them they are the hottest thing…in the last two weeks i have seen more articles on nfts the wall street journal had a big piece this morning you have marketplacenpr talking about it nba topshot is now kind of …i would almost say it’s mainstream but lex it obviously stands for nonfungible tokens again give us your take on why it’s so popularlex so there are fungible currencies like the dollar if i gave you a dollar if i gave you another dollar you don’t care it’s the same eth and bitcoin and even the tokens of these defi protocols they’re all sort of the same divisible and fractional nonfungible tokens are a unique object broadly speaking you can have additions you know you can have ten of the same objects like you can have ten prints or posters of an andy warhol but they’re designed to be the one unique thing it can be a visual image that an artist makes like the digital artist beeple who i think has a  million christie’s auction going on right now so speaking about the mainstreamor it’s the videos of sports moments like nba top shot where you got fans collecting basically harry potter frames moving images of people they love and admire and just want to look at it all the time and feel that this is rare why does it matter there are some starting criticisms that misunderstand what’s actually going on right because you can say it’s nice you’ve got an image i’ve got that image i just screenshot it what’s unique about your image the nft is supposed to be unique and owned and it goes in that same wallet that i was talking about when you’re walking around…you know starbucks doesn’t have a locker you have the wallet in your pocket and similarly now in your wallet is your collectible card of lebron or whateverand so the first criticism which i think is incorrect is i can just take a screenshot i can rightclick and save and the answer to why that’s wrong is the same answers to what’s the difference between the mona lisa and the poster of mona lisa the poster of the mona lisa carries the same visual information and it doesn’t matter because nobody cares about the visual information itself the visual information is a very small part of the pleasure of what the mona lisa generates right it’s the original artwork it is the history of that object being originally made by the creator of that object who is famous and has social capital it is the historical context of what has happened to that piece of art who has owned it how has it passed through different environments over time you know and then it has cultural importancethe one that’s hanging here’s important and the print in your dorm room is not and so it’s the exact same dynamic here just because you have a copy doesn’t mean you have the original and the original is the thing that the artist made and then you can get to kind of the discussion of let’s have two artists one is a painter and makes beautiful portraits and another is using oil paint and then another is a painter that makes absolutely gorgeous portraits but they use their ipad and photoshop they spend an identical amount of time creating that beautiful portraitwhy is it that you value the physical but not the digital in part because the digital is infinitely reproducible and so there’s no price whereas the physical is scarce so now what’s happened is we have a mechanism that says this digital work is scarce and authentic and you know i’m not here to sort of pump up crypto prices that’s not the point of the storytelling but the shift is like a breath of fresh air for creators for digital creators and by the way there are fewer and fewer nondigital creators and more and more digital creators because we’re all stuck in our covid worlds and it’s sort of obvioushere’s my sort of…i’ll to try to conclude on this this is the framework i have…so what napster did and i grew up on napster as my defining moments in the early ’s was it massively it exploded the demand side the people who got to enjoy music because it crashed the price to zero of all music so you go along the demand curve right supply and demand kind of cross and then you crash the prize to zero and so anybody who wants music now has access to it massive increase in people enjoying creative output and file sharing and all thatartists got crushed lars ulrich of metallica was particularly unhappy teenagers were jailed that was a fun time and so now we’re in the opposite moment of that where all of a sudden you have digital scarcity on creative output digital creative output and so you can have markets and economies around it so you’re seeing a massive entry on the supply side so more musicians more artists anybody who knows how to deal with an audience and make music or videos or art is now trying to create more stuff that is blockchainanchored because they feel like they can get paid for it so i would say it took  years to balance out what file sharing in napster did and that’s what we’re looking at nowpeter right i want to dig into the weeds a little bit if i may i was listening to the recent podcast you did and i’ll link to that in the show notes you’re talking about the music and creators and you can…i want to talk about how smart contracts are kind of incorporated here on your show you gave the example of someone creating an original piece of music and then someone else could have taken that original piece and then adapting it to their own and having a new original piece but the original creator also gets a cut and it’s all done through smart contracts can you explain a little bit about the mechanics therelex so it all starts with why ethereum and programmable blockchains are valuable they’re valuable because they are digital property rights enforcement system and that’s useful when you have economies like the reason finance has been the first use case on ethereum is because economies and trading and market are very natural to the system which says this is real this is not you know here is money and here’s instruments and so it is naturally the case that the economic features of the creative industry are what is the emergent the obvious case coming out of hereyou know it’s not about like how can i look at digital art it’s about how can i have exchange and venues of exchange and then royalty payments or commissions against this art it is software capitalism i mean there is going to be a lot of people from the remix culture of the  or a digital artist a digitally native artist who bristle at nfts because they grew up on file sharing free remixing copy left you know like hate the lawyers finally we’re free of that and this goes the other way this brings back…this is drm  to the max you know it brings back power to the artist but it is participatory and optional like you don’t have to buy the original print of the cd you can just always listen to it on spotifyi think what you’re referencing it applies both to art and to music where let’s say you have a piece of art that you’ve made and you’ve posted it on a platform like opensea or rarible or one of the other ones and you’re the author and so you might specify that you as the author get a  or  commission in all secondary markets every time it’s resold you get a commission so let’s say you sell your first piece for  you get the  and somebody else owns it and then two years goes by and you’re super famous you’re amazing you’re really big on twitter and so whoever owned your piece is now able to sell it for  even though they bought it from you for that’s a life changing event for that owner of the digital asset then you’re also getting  so you’re going to get  on that essentially commission or royalty payment in perpetuity every time the exchange happens that revenue comes back to you as the creator that is basically the collapse of the entire creative media intermediation value chain from a financial perspective which again is obvious if you think about fintech fintech has been cutting out intermediation for commerce and for trade and so on and this is what’s happening here same thing for music right music is unbelievably……i did a research in to this last weekmusic the structure of royalty is an ownership and who gets paid for what and if it’s used in a commercial versus if it’s used on a spotify stream a massively complex economic structure you know but to simplify it to the basics the artist gets a very small percentage for the streaming or the usage of the piece of music and often they might not even have to rights to the actual thing that they perform their music label might have given them the song they perform and the music label also gets paid for the usage of the information in the song and you only get for the performance rightsanyway there are now djs and musicians who are minting their cds like the original cds to their fan base and then there are mechanisms by which you know royalties from the resale of that music go to the musicians even when their fans purchase it so we’re very early in these dynamics they’re very much not polished but that is the promise i think for the disruption inside of the value chain in the creative industrypeter i just saw an email like kings of leon i think it was just on the weekend how they released their new album as an nft so that’s groundbreaking in and of itself i want to ask about square and tidal which you wrote about recently i read so many articles about it and i felt like most did not have any idea what the hell jack dorsey was thinking when he bought he spent this money on tidalyou’ve got this long piece about that love to sort of get some of your thoughts on that because the way i look at it you put in this piece you saw how broken and the financial industry…the financial part of the music industry is where these people are getting a third of a cent for one play on spotify and you just can…whereas he could have made a decent living selling a few thousand records or  records back in the ’s and ’s now you have to be a megastar to make a living therejust maybe touch briefly on why you think …what jack dorsey is thinking by acquiring tidal which for all intents and purposes was really a second tier or third tier player in the music streaming spacelex so i write this for the fintech blueprint which is my weekly newsletter and then it gets the long take so syndicated on coindesk and you wouldn’t believe the amount of flack i got from the crypto community for this nft article about …where i framed it through the perspective of square and tidal you know telling the nft story through the perspective of this deal rather than trying to tell it through the perspective of ethereumtorn to shreds for not schilling eth which is you know maybe check the body of my work but the core outline is this it’s not a to b it’s like logic steps a through z so title is maybe a third tier streaming service it does print  million in revenue and it has  million users so if they were a fintech it’d be  billion so there’s that i think even on a cash flow basis it’s not a terrible deal at all it’s good for jayz who i think bought it for anyway so it is a music streaming service and it’s got really cool people involved they’re just cool the main point is that they have a huge audience and square has an interesting history ark invest talks about this very very well in their research how did cash app totally…how did they completely run around venmo venmo was so far ahead and was growing a really fast clip out of nowhere it felt like cash app came out and caught up and overtook their growth curve now being the primary  money movement app we will put zelle to the sideand so how did they do that and the answer is they did it through really clever growth hacking which is they partnered with the hiphop community and with the influencer community and instead of spending money on google ads they let the influencers and the artists do giveaways so hey i’m a musician if you want  tell me what your cash app wallet is you drop the link through cash app wallet and that person sends you the giveaway so like i don’t know which artist but it’d be cool for like jayz to send me  and all i have to do is drop a line with my account to cash app on a twitter thread and this is what worked for them unbelievably well really smart clever marketingi think it was definitely connected to…i’m guessing it’s connected to jack’s understanding of social media because of running twitter and understanding people psychology on twitter and all of these and so that is the square growth hack of course square also has bitcoin as an asset that you trade inside the app and there are teams specifically dedicated to crypto development i think both inside of square and twitter and it’s no secret that jack is an enthusiast for crypto infrastructure more generally and so if you kind of connect the lines what can you do with tidalfirst you’ve just bought yourself your gotomarket strategy you actually own your gotomarket strategy because you understand how to market through the artists who are cool no other fintech really outside of a couple of teenager ones using tiktok understand how to do this and reach the populations served by these artists so that’s number onenumber two is you’re a small business bank if you are square and oh boy are there a lot of small businesses inside of tidal every single musician is a small business that can now have every single financial service as part of their streaming experience and i think that’s really important i think they’re also buying an additional customer base for their  side but then if you take one step further in terms of thinking through nfts and the economics of scarce digital art and music you can kind of paint forward a vision of the world where title is integrated as a bank but is also a wallet of the authentic music of the actual music objectsso the streaming stuff is a way to pay publishers it’s a way to pay royalties it’s the mathematics that creates royalties and if you own both the bank and the streaming service and you have the direct relationship with the artist and you’re able to transform the publisher into a blockchainbased smart contract and therefore you don’t need an intermediary to do the artist relationship and so on it becomes a really novel and strange and weird but it’s like a bundle of options right in a black swan event where this intuition is right this is a massively valuable company and i think that’s probably underneath itpeter right right anyway we’ve gone over time but before we leave it here i do want to get you to paint a picture if you would about the future of finance i feel like we are in this fascinating time right now…the last ten years of fintech we’ve had some really good incremental change there’s been a lot of good work done and i think some really impressive developments but it feels like in this time of potentially just rewiring the cord of the whole financial system maybe you could just give us your vision of what this is going to look like as sort of defi nfts obviously they are related as they become more mainstreamlex trying so hard to be precise the mistake of the last decade of fintech which is really fintech using that word is thinking that a digital storefront is enough yes netflix started out by mailing you dvds who cares that embarrassing it’s wrong it’s done it’s over nobody cares right i spent a chunky six years of my life building wealth tech software for financial advisors so they can deliver websites to their clients or an app to their clientsokay you’re talking about a value chain that many people who are growing up in fortnite will never touch in their lives because if you are  million investor who has grown up in fortnite you’re not using a swiss private bank you’re just not you wouldn’t be caught dead using a swiss private bank and i love swiss private banks as somebody who has like…you know lehman brothers would have loved to be ubs i spent a lot of time thinking about that modeland so i think what we are going to realize and see now very clearly is that digital manufacturing is much more important than digital distribution and that in every disruptive cliche things that are at this point sort of lame to talk about which is what happened to media from the internet and google what happened to transportation from uber what happened to music from spotify in all of those cases it’s not distribution it’s manufacturingthere is no internet of paper books there is no spotify of cdroms it doesn’t work it’s a waste of time and so i think we are seeing that shift now where digitally native manufacturing of financial product actually is going on and digital distribution of course obviously there’s going to be someone whether a new entrepreneur whether goldman sachs or whether robinhood that’s just going bolt on their consumer footprint to the new stuff and we also know what the outcome is in terms of price so price has to collapse because it cost nothing to manufacture and then the value chain collapses as welland so to me that industry outcome is really…it feels very clear you know especially in a world where google pay is a  million user neo bank that’s sitting on top of bankingasaservice and has done every sort of wiggle possible in order to not be a bank and at the same time provide all these financial services give it five years and they are going to connect to the amazon cloud for ethereum and the end like literally the end if amazon is running the ethereum cloud with every single financial services open source protocol in it and google is connecting to amazon to distribute all of it what else exists like i don’t knowand so i think the challenge the question is how much simultaneous time periods are we going to live in because…i think you’re deep in the payment ecosystem as well and so you know there are multiple rails that are alive today at the same time people use cash people use qr codes they use electronic payments they use still point of sale terminals they’ve got the card networks there’s faster payments there’s ach lots and lots of rails it’s not a winner take all and it’s very possible that we’re going to have just a separate economy for kind of new finance that sits alongside wall street and silicon valley and fintech can over time…like amazon goes from  share to  share of all of commerce and i don’t know what the destination isthe anecdote i have is you can be on the road in the us and you can have a horse and buggy and an amish person on that road and then next to them you can have some chugger from the ’s eating gasoline and being like a very dirty car but with a motor next to that you can have a self driving tesla that’s fully electric and it’s the same road and it’s all the same people in the same country but they’re living in different time periods so we are right at that edge of just i think a completely new financial infrastructure emergingpeter okay we’ll have to leave it there it’s a very exciting time lex it was great to chat with you and really appreciate your coming on the show todaylex my pleasure thanks for having mepeter okay see youi don’t know about you but my head is spinning after listening to lex talk there for the last  plus minutes we’ve had such amazing things happen i think in the last ten years of fintech as lex said and i tend to agree that was the precursor for what’s really coming i don’t whether nft is just going to be this fad that are going to just crash and burn but i think the technology behind them the smart contracts having these things really be intelligent you know ways to kind of transacti think that concept is here to stay it just makes perfect sense whether we get there in five years in ten years or  years i think this is the way finance is going that’s why i wanted to make it such i didn’t want to edit it out i made it such a long show because i felt like it was important to get into the details hereanyway on that note i will sign off i very much appreciate your listening and i’ll catch you next time
