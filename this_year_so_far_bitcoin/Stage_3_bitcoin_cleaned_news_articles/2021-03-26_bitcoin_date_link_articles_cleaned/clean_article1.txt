here’s some free advice for the honda motor company market your cars to the newly bitcoin richi’ve already got the ad copy for youa true bitcoiner is building for the future and deferring gratification she doesn’t blow her hardearned savings on flashy toys she prefers a solid dependable family carand a slogan…lambos are for losers hodlers drive hondasmarc hochstein coindesks executive editor owns some bitcoin and if he were smarter hed have bought more years ago this article is excerpted from the node coindesks daily roundup of the most pivotal stories on the future of money and web  you can subscribe to get the full newsletter hereok so i’m no don draper it’s doubtful honda or any other affordable carmaker would heed my suggestion any time soon it’s different for luxury electric vehicle maker tesla which doesn’t need to be told – it’s already doing something similarnot the author getty imagesdiamond handsthis week the manufacturer began accepting bitcoin btc as payment for its cars delivering on a promise made in early february by its impish chief executive elon musk underscoring his faith in the currency musk declared on wednesday that tesla would keep rather than convert any bitcoin it earns from car salestypically the rare merchant that accepts crypto as payment for goods or services will swap it right away for us dollars or another fiat currency that’s understandable given the price volatility and the low likelihood that a merchant’s suppliers would take magic internet money but the tesla chief said his company is hodlingfor the uninitiated hodling is bitcoin slang for refusing to sell btc either to take profits in a bull market or to cut losses in a bear market based on a forum poster’s drunken misspelling of “hold” the word broadly connotes a steely determination in the face of fear uncertainty and doubt a hodler is someone who to borrow from rudyard kipling “can keep your head when all about youare losing theirs and blaming it on you”not satoshi nakamoto creative commonsmusk clearly is one in at least the narrow sense having invested  billion in bitcoin for tesla’s corporate treasury beginning this year over the last  months the cryptocurrency’s price has soared nearly  as inflation fears a selfperpetuating hype cycle and possibly pandemic lockdown boredom spurred buying among individual and institutional investors like tesla for instanceyet while i’m sure musk would be happy to keep growing tesla’s btc stash one car sale at a time i strongly suspect that isn’t his only or main motivationrather my gut is that the payment option is at least in part if not primarily a clever marketing maneuverincentives to hodlfirst off there’s no indication tesla is offering a discount to buyers who pay with bitcoin which you might expect the company to do if its main goal were to acquire more of the stuff also tesla surely understands bitcoiners are strongly disincentivized to part with their “sats” a loving nickname for the currency’s smallest unit  btc in homage to creator satoshi nakamotothis is partly for the reason i alluded to in my quixotic honda pitch bitcoin is deflationary by design there’s a set amount –  million btc – that will ever be minted yet as it grows in popularity denominating things such as luxury cars in bitcoin ends up hurting the buyer over the long runwhile the price oscillates wildly from one minute to the next if you zoom out the lens real wide bitcoin has generally appreciated over time which encourages saving or “hoarding” depending on your worldview remember that pizza purchased for  bitcoin in  ten thousand bitcoin is worth  million today hope the pizza tasted goodwould you sell your birthright for a slice no how about the whole pie what if i throw in some garlic bread nicolás perondiunsplashalso in the us crypto is treated as property for tax purposes which means that if you buy a coin for say  and it doubles in value and you spend that extra dollar on a cup of coffee you are supposed to report the purchase to the internal revenue service and pay tax on it it remains to be seen whether uncle sam will go after every last joe schmoe who fails to report a piddling purchase but it’s reasonable to assume anyone who uses crypto gains to buy a tesla which can run from  to  would show up on the taxman’s radareven if a buyer can overcome those hurdles tesla isn’t making it easy as coindesk’s daniel kuhn reported thursday when paying tesla with bitcoin a car buyer has “about  minutes” to complete the transaction or else the price in btc expires and a new one must be requested also tesla will only accept exact amounts and will not reimburse payments sent to an incorrect addressall told even if you have large bags of bitcoin it may make more sense to pay with fiat whether for a tesla or a tall lattetribal signalingcrypto is already obsessed with a car the lamborghini but it’s more of a joke than anything were tesla to become the true status symbol in this industry it could move the needleby embracing bitcoiner culture musk is likely to make more sales among that crowd than would happen otherwise even if they’re settled in greenbacks any extra bitcoin tesla picks up would be gravyin the wednesday tweet musk also revealed tesla is running its own node rather than relying on a third party to tell it what’s happening on the bitcoin network this is considered a best practice for advanced users but it’s also a signal to the tribe i get it i’m one of you it’s closely associating the tesla brand and musk’s with the ethos of the sovereign individual that animates the crypto community not least of all the bitcoin faithfulthe absolute madman norad and usnorthcom public affairsthink of it as a weird  century twist on affinity marketing but without any formal partnership like the one my college had with a credit card lender in the  which led to me getting up to my ears in debt from charging stuff i didn’t need and couldn’t afford gee thanks alma mater i wish bitcoin were around back then to set me straightthere is also a less charitable interpretation of musk’s messaging that he’s trying to divert attention away from bad news for tesla as coindesk’s muyao shen reported in february the big comingout party coincided with the revelation by chinese officials that they were questioning tesla about quality and safety issues and this week’s bitcoin announcement conveniently happened right after reports that us regulators are scrutinizing tesla’s autopilot technologyif true this explanation is not mutually exclusive with my hunch tesla hodling bitcoin could be a cynical pr move and a marketing coup – and a sincere adoption of an innovation in the world of bits by an innovator in the world of atoms all at the same time binary thinking is for foolsit’s far from certain if the marketing ploy if that’s what it is will work “not quite sure if anything sold yet in bitcoin” a tesla representative told my colleague thursdaybut for my money it’s better than anything madison avenue could come up with
