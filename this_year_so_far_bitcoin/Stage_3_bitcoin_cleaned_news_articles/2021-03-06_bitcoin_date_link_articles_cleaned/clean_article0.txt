can take advantage of itprices for these cryptocurrencies which have less familiar names like ether and nano are exploding because theyre riding on the coattails of bitcoin which has been on a

other canadians with a stake in the game while attracting large players from wall street like never beforebitcoins flirtation with mainstream acceptance and the gravitydefying climb in the price — along with some whiteknuckle dips — have made headlines around the world and even captured the attention of the doubtersunderneath the mania is a potential sea change in the world of finance that observers say was made possible by a global pandemic and whats at stake is nothing less than a war for the future of moneybut there are plenty of skeptics they warn bitcoin is a highly speculative investment play with no real value backing it up and that investors run the risk of crushing lossesoliver dobson estimates banks handle only  or  per cent of his finances he says he manages the rest in crypto networks submitted by oliver dobsoncreate money out of thin airthe rally has made dobsons seemingly bizarre occupation all the more lucrative among other methods he said he uses bitcoin to buy other digital coins on crypto exchanges and sell them when they rise in price he also keeps his eye out for socalled airdrops where crypto startups release free tokens or coins as part of a

cryptocurrencies has its share of colourful characters it also has some heavy hitters from legacy financewealthy investors and big institutions such as paypal holdings inc mastercard inc visa inc and tesla inc are embracing bitcoin in various ways signalling broader approval of crypto for the first timethe  routto understand how this happened and what it all means its helpful to look back at the last bitcoin wave which ended when investors watched vast sums of wealth get wiped out in a brutal crashinvented as an alternative to national currencies in the depths of the financial crisis in  bitcoin enjoyed one of its sharpest climbs almost a decade later in  the going rate escalated from less than  per coin to nearly  in six monthsthis bitcoin boom was driven not by big institutions like banks and pension funds but by amateur regular investors making a bet on new technology said alex mcdougall the managing director of portfolio management at the bitcoin and digital asset fund manager  in torontopeople were drawn to an alternative to the legacy banking system mcdougall said bitcoin and its underlying technology presented a possible endrun around these gatekeepers allowing people to do their own banking without a large financial institutionwe saw this potential move towards a radically open world and an entire new generation of wealth could be created in an entirely different type of market participant mcdougall saidmonty kohli a  cryptocurrency investor says he believes in the ethos of decentralized finance and continues to have money tied up in digital coins submitted by monty kohliwe also saw a ton of scams and fraud and a bunch of quite frankly bs that sprung up around the marketthe price of bitcoin ultimately crashed in  dropping more than  per cent in a year left in the ashes were people who lost their life savingsmonty kohli a cryptocurrency investor in his early  at the time didnt face catastrophic losses but still watched up to  in wealth disappear despite the setback he believes in the ethos of decentralized finance and continues to have money invested in digital coins but its money he said he can afford to losenow  kohli said hes a bitcoin banker he said he loans out tokens in a secondary crypto market where he collects interest though he maintains a day job working in the finance department of a toronto companymy time horizon for investing is quite long and so thats where i can also afford to take some risk in my portfolio he saidwhile longtime core believers like kohli remain in the game some bigwigs on wall street are suddenly stepping in from the sidelines and thats part of what makes this latest bitcoin wave so different fuelling the latest bitcoin rallythere is relentless demand said edward moya a new yorkbased senior market analyst with the currency trading company oanda corp what were starting to see is wall street main street are really embracing the crypto world even when we have significant selloff days there is still strong demand and its globalmoya said the arguments in favour of an alternative to governmentissued currency havent changed all that much but critical conditions have shifted in the past year making that case more persuasiveif we did not have covid we would not be talking about bitcoin right now he saidcentral banks around the world have been pumping trillions of dollars into their economies to help them survive crippling lockdowns and various restrictions meant to control the spread of a major concern with all the pandemicrelated stimulus is that it threatens to devalue or debase national currencies said gavin brown a senior lecturer and associate professor of financial technology at the university of liverpool gavin browna major concern with all of that stimulus is that it threatens to devalue or debase national currencies said gavin brown a senior lecturer and associate professor of financial technology at the university of liverpool the purchasing power is less because quite simply theres more of it and therefore its worth lessbitcoin on the other hand is not controlled by a central bank it doesnt have any domicile doesnt have any formal governance structure like you would expect with a company or a nation state brown saidinstead the supply of bitcoins is controlled by mathematical code and computer code which means that the supply side of bitcoin is known at all times it will never be more than  million critical infrastructure allows for big investmentscash was already on the decline for years while the pandemic has accelerated demand for fast and convenient digital payments analysts at the investment bank jp morgan said in a recent reportthe pandemic has boosted demand for digital services and also for alternative currencies as multiple rounds of stimulus accommodative monetary policy and excess savings have boosted money supply leading to record inflows into bitcoin investment vehiclescritical storage infrastructure is one development making cryptocurrency more accessible to institutional investors here an illustration of bitcoins logo stands on a pc motherboard dado ruvicillustrationreutersanother important change is that critical storage infrastructure required to hold large sums of bitcoin for institutional investors is now available tesla revealed in early february it had bought  billion us in bitcoin something that would have been almost impossible just a couple of years ago due to the lack of institutional controls and infrastructure at play brown saidits not only easier for some large institutions to invest the academic said its also more publicly acceptable — entirely different than the  surgea bet or an investmentsome bright minds in finance dont buy all of the enthusiasm stephen poloz the former governor of the bank of canada said in an interview that bitcoin is more of a speculative investment play than it is a currencyeven the pros who deal in bitcoin often use the word bet rather than invest which suggests in our minds its sufficiently volatile it really is close to gambling as opposed to actual investment since the asset itself has no intrinsic value said poloz a special advisor at the law firm osler hoskin  harcourtbut that doesnt mean that it cant become mainstreamstephen poloz a special advisor at the law firm osler hoskin  harcourt and a former governor of the bank of canada says bitcoin trading is akin to gambling sean kilpatrickcanadian presspoloz said the toronto stock exchange took important steps in this direction by listing two bitcoin exchangetraded funds it means investors can put money into bitcoin under a regulated system of controls that ensure those investments are backed by the coinsdobson the crypto token trader said the funds traded on the stock market and other developments such as paypals foray into bitcoin represent the antithesis of why cryptocurrencies exist in the first placewould you appreciate it if you agreed yesterday to buy a car paying in bitcoin and then you go to pick it up today and it cost you  percent more today than yesterday  stephen poloz former governor of the bank of canadathe whole point of cryptocurrency is that its peertopeer decentralized digital currency its immutable its uncensorable and its yours purely yours he saidthey dont give you access to withdraw your coins so you never actually own themdobson estimates that banks handle only  or  per cent of his finances and he manages the rest in crypto networksdollars dont make more dollars he said meaning he can make higher returns holding onto cryptos than national currencies so i keep basically everything i possibly can out of dollars i do everything in my power to make sure that the amount of canadian dollars that im holding is the smallest amount that i can get away withbut poloz argues bitcoin cant replace national currencies in part because it takes far longer to process transactions if for example someone used bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee the drink would likely be cold by the time the payment cleared while the technology could theoretically improve to make payments faster he said there is no fundamental value behind the coins leaving the price vulnerable to wild swingswould you appreciate it if you agreed yesterday to buy a car paying in bitcoin and then you go to pick it up today and it cost you  per cent more today than yesterday he said thats not the kind of volatility that you can endure in something that is being used for paymentsa real seismic shiftthere is no shortage of predictions of where bitcoins latest wave is headed the financial services firm ubs wealth management reportedly warned investors there is little stopping cryptocurrency prices from falling to zero us treasury secretary janet yellen said she worries about potential investor lossespeople pass in front of a crypto currency bitcoin change shop near the grand bazaar on december   in istanbul ozan koseafpgetty imagesbrown the fintech academic from the uk said there probably will be a correction or drop in the price of bitcoin over the coming weeks and months but he expects the appeal of a decentralized currency wont disappearit allows them to move money without a payment intermediary he said the idea of doing banking without a bank  that is a paradigm that flies in the face of not just centuries of financial development but millennia thats a real seismic shiftstill brown doesnt believe bitcoin will someday dominate global finance where this is ultimately headed he predicts is a digital currency warthere are three groups that brown believes will be competing for supremacy decentralized coins like bitcoin corporate coins such as one launched by jp morgan and the currency facebook proposes and finally future digital currencies backed by central bankstheres a threeway fight for the future of money
