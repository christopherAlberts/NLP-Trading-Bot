the cryptosphere is on fire this week dozens of coins have hit alltime highs athsand with big industry players like square and paypal getting on board with cryptocurrencies alongside interest and adoption by banks like jpmorgan chase goldman sachs and citigroup cryptos winning streak appears to be set to continuethere are a few reasons why this past year specifically there has been such an influx of cash into the crypto industrythe pandemicthe recessionthe hypethe investment climatelet’s break it down a bitthe pandemic and associated recession have led to an abnormal investment climate in the stock market and people are looking for alternative investment optionsthen there’s the hype surrounding nonfungible tokens nfts and a growing interest in decentralized finance defi — a way to execute financial transactions that cuts traditional institutions out and instead uses the blockchain coinbase the largest crypto exchange in the us went public on the nasdaq in april with an initial valuation of  billionthree lesstalkedabout cryptos cardano binance coin and moneroif you’ve been reading cryptosavvy you know that in recent weeks we’ve touched on bitcoin bitcoin cash ether litecoin

development teams — both vital features that play a part in the search for ‘the next big thing’ ada bnb and xmr arent your average “shitcoins” a term used in the industry to describe cryptocurrencies with “little to no value or no immediate discernable purpose”cardano binance coin and monero — which would you use getty imagescryptosavvy is an occasional series from inverse that explains the world of cryptocurrency and where it’s going nextcardano adawhile some coins have substantial amounts of money flowing into them many don’t have solid realworld use cases cough dogecoin  cardano the sixthlargest cryptocurrency by market capitalization doesthe company behind cardano iohk is building a platform to accommodate usage in the education retail finance and healthcare sectors in april iohk’s blockchain was picked to revamp the country of ethiopia’s education system the technology will form the backbone of a system to verify grades monitor school performance and boost education for five million students and teachers nationwidethe news may have played a role in cardano’s recent price performance the coin increased in value by over  percent last week and on sunday it hit an ath of a little more than  in value the milestone followed news that cardano founder charles hoskinson dined with wyoming governor mark gordon blockchain advocate caitlin long and university of wyoming president edward seidel among otherswyoming has been dubbed “the promised land for bitcoin investors” thanks to its cuttingedge legal framework for cryptocurrencies and blockchain techan important characteristic of ada is the max supply cap of  billion coins coins such as dogecoin have no supply cap — about  billion doge are put into circulation every year when a coin doesn’t have a max supply cap they are inherently less scarce and in turn arguably less valuablecardano coin shutterstockbinance coin bnbbinance coin the thirdlargest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was created to offer traders an alternative way to pay for fees charged to use binance the worlds mostused crypto exchange for some perspective binance has had over  billion flow through it in the past  — that’s almost three times more than the second mostused crypto exchange huobi globalaccording to a press release in june the exchange will launch its own marketplace where users can create buy and sell nfts as well as a trading market that anyone can use to mint new tokens these additions should serve the exchange and in turn bnb very well sales of nfts exceeded  billion in the first quarter of this year that’s more than twenty times the volume of the previous quarter likely at least in part because of this news binance coin hit an alltime high of  on mondaybnb initially operated on the ethereum blockchain but it moved to its own blockchain binance chain which does not on its own support smart contracts however one of the most significant competitive advantages of binance as an exchange is its focus on development highlighted by the more recent deployment of the binance smart chain bscbsc is best described as a blockchain that runs in parallel to the binance chain — the added bonus being that bsc boasts smart contract functionalitybnb is an integral part of the successful functioning of many binance sideprojectsbinance is not just a crypto exchange — it has an entire ecosystem of projects and protocols for its users these include the aforementioned bsc the binance academy binance research and the socalled trust wallet among othersbinance coin like cardano also has a max supply cap as noted above this is an important feature of a coin when looking at its longterm value in a separate attempt to combat depreciation binance plans to over time burn half of its coins bnb burning events are scheduled to occur every quarter until  million bnb are destroyed equating to  percent of the total bnb ever issued  million bnb these periodic burns meant to help stabilize the price of the cryptocurrency are another reason why binance coin is likely to have robust longterm prospectsbinance coin shutterstockmonero xmrmonero a privacy and securityfocused cryptocurrency sits a little further down the list compared to cardano and binance coin it currently ranks twentyfourth by market capitalization but it’s still worth talking about even if it’s for this reason alone last year the irs offered a “bounty” of  to anyone who could crack the monero network’s security features and reveal its userscryptocurrencies like bitcoin are only semiprivate while the protocol doesnt reveal a user’s real name transactions can still be linked back to individuals in fact some blockchain analytics firms specialize in deanonymizing bitcoin activity and selling the information to law enforcementwith monero a wallet’s contents the number of transactions made and the addresses of the senders and recipients of the coins are obfuscated this is made possible by a protocol called ring confidential transactions rctthe us government is actively trying to “crack the code”monero has a passionate and dedicated base of advocates and users but the coin can be used for illicit activities ransomware being one and it is often used for more secure purchases on dark web illicit drug marketplaces and the like because of this the coin catches some flak and the us government is actively trying to “crack the code”the irs’s proposal was as follows an initial  payment for developing and proving a working concept and then a  payment after the successful completion of a pilot test the organization’s application deadline was september   and the pilot test had to be completed within eight months so we won’t know for sure if anyone was successful — at least for a week or twoa coin that offers truly confidential transactionson may  monero hit an alltime high of  spurred by increasing demand for a coin that offers confidential transactions the coin has seen  percent gains over the past three months and other privacycentered coins like zcash verge and horizen have seen significant gains as well this despite increasing attention and concern from authorities about its use and a decreasing number of exchanges that offer the coinswhen posing the question “does monero have a max supply cap” the answer is “yes sort of” the coin’s max supply cap of  million is expected to be reached in may  but after that miners will be incentivized using socalled “tail emissions” these are a mechanism by which a tiny amount of xmr is indefinitely fed into the system every minute as a reward for miners so while there will be some monero distributed after the supply cap is reached the amount is minusculemonero is on this list because in my opinion it plays an important role in the crypto ecosystem while it’s true that it has a reputation as one of the goto coins for cybercrime at least from my own philosophical perspective a truly private cryptocurrency is necessary to hedge against the allseeing eyes of big data and big brother and it’s important to remember too that xmr could also be useful in countries where freedoms are limited by the government for example a journalist who needs to utilize a virtual private network can use it to purchase the application anonymouslymonero coin shutterstockas i write in my last story “can bitcoin cash ever challenge bitcoins dominance” with so many players and variables involved it’s basically a fulltime job to monitor the prices and rankings of the cryptocurrency market so i’m not going to offer any predictions for future price movementsbut cardano binance coin and monero — with their strong use cases and forwardthinking development teams — are certainly three coins to keep an eye on
