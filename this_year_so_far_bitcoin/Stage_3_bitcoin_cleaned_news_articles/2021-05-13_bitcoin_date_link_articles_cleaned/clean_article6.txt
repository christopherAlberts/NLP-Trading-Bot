as the market for alternative assets heated up earlier this year many investors found themselves trying to differentiate between the various investment options although there is a lot of buzz around nonfungible tokens and memebased cryptocurrencies it was the rise in bitcoin cryptobtc that seemed to ignite the frenzywith the initial public offering of coinbase and the prevalence of cryptocurrency miners it can be hard to determine if one will prove a better investment than the asset itself lets dig into one miner riot blockchain nasdaqriot to better understand what the pros and cons might beperformance and correlationfor a company that mines bitcoin one would expect riot blockchains stock performance to be directly tied to the digital currency theoretically the earnings the company generates are simply the value of the mined coins minus all of the costs that go into setting up and running the operation oddly that hasnt always been the caseperiod change in bitcoin change in riot blockchain  months    months    months  other than the past three months the change in riots stock price seems to be about  to  when compared to bitcoin the price of bitcoin has been weak this month falling  in the same time shares of riot blockchain have collapsed part of the shortterm disconnect may be the number of shares outstanding the company has issued a lot of equity to fund purchases of special mining computers called antminers that dilution has undermined the stock price dividing each owners stake across more and more sharesdate shares outstanding change may   million na november   million  february   million  may   million similar to buying stock in companies that extract commodities like gold and oil from the earth there are risks that have nothing to do with the price of what they are mining dilution is one of themtransparencyone way shareholders can stay informed is by following the companys earnings reports and subsequent conference calls thats not so easy with riot in   and  management filed a notification with the securities and exchange commission sec stating that it would not be able to submit its fullyear report in a timely manner management stuck to the delayed schedule in  going four months and  days between its third and fourthquarter reports it skipped the sec notice since the agency extended deadlines due to the coronavirus to date management has not hosted calls or offered questionandanswer sessions that approach is understandable when shares are primarily held by one party however insiders currently own only  of riot blockchain the lack of transparency should give investors pauseinvestigating the primary holders of bitcoin offers no more comfort no two lists of the wealthiest cryptocurrency holders are the same but a recent ranking showed a definite concentration of the top ten one is the creator of bitcoin two are the founders of bitmain technologies  the company selling antminers to riot three others are founders of chinese crypto trading platforms and two are the winklevoss twins of facebook fame usually its important to make sure that the interests of executives are aligned with shareholders that isnt possible with bitcoin since there is no management that said the largest holders do seem to have an incentive to keep speculation and trading volumes high it doesnt mean there is anything shady happening but as charlie munger put it show me the incentives and i will show you the outcomewealth creation or destructionone way to evaluate a business is by comparing how money flows in and out of the operation comparing the two flows can shed light on how any cash was produced and if it is sustainablefor instance riot blockchain raised about  million from issuing those additional shares in  and  million from selling cryptocurrency those inputs were offset by  million in negative cash from operations that means running the company actually burned cash last year another outflow was the  million management spent on property and equipment the  antminersthat left more cash on the balance sheet at the end of the year but highlights a disconcerting reality in a year where the price of bitcoin went up more than  riot blockchain spent tens of millions of dollars and ended up burning cash rather than generating it thats fine for a company that doesnt need to keep investing as much but riots purchase of crypto mining equipment isnt an isolated expense management acknowledges this in sec filings pegging the useful life at two yearsthe company doesnt report bitcoin production numbers on a consistent basis so its hard to calculate a detailed performance versus just buying bitcoin however it significantly trails the simpler strategy using last years average price of  even after a recent pullback bitcoin currently sits at  at least last year spending all that money on the asset itself would have significantly outperformed setting up and running a mining operationsplit decisionalthough just buying bitcoin has also been the clear winner over the past few months the longer term has highlighted how levered riots prospects are to the digital currency owning the stock introduces risks that bitcoin holders dont have to deal with but the money spent on special mining equipment last year could lead to a gusher of profits in whenever it finally gets filed the firstquarter earnings report should be a window into the rest of the year with the company mining  coins at an average price of  during the period the money flowing in shouldnt be eaten away by investments this may leave a pile of profits for shareholders at least until management has to purchase new antminers if that proves true the stocks recent underperformance could reverse quickly if riot still cant turn a profit investors might be better off giving up on the idea that it ever can
