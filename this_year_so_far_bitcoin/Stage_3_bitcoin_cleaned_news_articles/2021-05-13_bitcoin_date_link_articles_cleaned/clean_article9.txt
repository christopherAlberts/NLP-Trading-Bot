blockchain analysis of the billions of dollars in bitcoin stolen during the  hack of cryptocurrency exchange bitfinex shows an interesting evolution in the slow and careful laundering of those fundscryptocurrency exchanges may once have been a quick cashing out option but criminals like the bitfinex hackers mostly gravitate towards large darknet marketplaces these days according to research provided exclusively by blockchain analytics firm ellipticmeanwhile privacy wallets like wasabi wallet or joinmarket appear to have become the preferred option over oncepopular bitcoin mixing services at least  of all proceeds of crime in bitcoin were sent through privacy wallets in  according to early data from ellipticnot everyone will remember the august  bitfinex hack when almost  bitcoin worth  million at that time but now around  billion was stolen from the exchangeonly about  of the stolen bitcoin has been laundered or exchanged to date and the vast majority has not moved at all according to elliptic however an uptick in bitcoin’s price may have tempted the thieves into shifting about  million worth in november  in april  another  million worth of coins were movedlongidle funds have been on the move source elliptictoo privateyou don’t have to be a crypto libertarian to be concerned about privacy on the internet which seems paradoxically pulled between rules like general data

conditions and privacy policywasabi wallet an opensource software that weaves together a collection of bitcoin transactions as an obfuscation tactic is largely administered and overseen by a private company called zksnacks based in gibraltarthis raises an interesting philosophical question at least from the point of view of blockchain analytics firms like elliptic which has been busy tracking bitcoin swiped from bitfinex“given that wasabi wallet is now facilitating a huge proportion of all illicit transactions in crypto is what zksnacks doing as a company legal” said elliptic cofounder tom robinson in an interview “they are effectively doing the same thing as a mixer operator would so aren’t they going to be in the sights of regulators”wasabi’s stancethere are a couple of important points to note herefirst the current regulatory regime applies to cryptocurrencies in custodial settings that is to say where a company like an exchange virtual asset service provider or vasp in regulator speak takes custody and holds a user’s coins applications that are noncustodial which includes wasabi wallet do not fall within the regulator’s purview although it’s also worth noting that regulatory guidance is steadily creeping towards noncustodial walletssecond the “zk” in zksnacks stands for “zero knowledge” a branch of technology that shields any information about the user of the zksnacks platform from prying eyes including from the company itself“police departments from all over the world have knocked on our door investigating certain transactions” zksnacks ceo and cofounder bálint harmat said in an interview adding“they have figured out through blockchain analytics companies that some of the transactions were made through wasabi wallet and they ask whether we can share any kind of personal identification information with them or ip addresses or whatever”harmat said to the firm’s best knowledge it simply cannot share anything because of the way the software is built“even if we gave someone access to all of our servers they wouldn’t be able to gather any kind of data because we don’t have data this is the way we build the software” he saidgibraltar where zksnacks is based became a hub for egaming back in the early  is proud of its talent for keeping up with innovation including crypto the gibraltar financial services commission gfsc even has a distributed ledger technology frameworkthe company has touted gibraltar’s laws and regulations on its website and in interviews without claiming it is under the government’s supervision“zksnacks will protect processed data in the customer service process adequately against unauthorized access of third parties in accordance with the provisions of the legal framework of gibraltar as well as the european union” the website sayshillebrand told coindesk “this company was created in gibraltar where there is clearly stated regulation that noncustodial transactions or wallets do not fall under these  fincen regulations so according to gibraltar law this is absolutely legal for the company to exist and to offer the service that it does it’s just like a communication service basically and not a financial intermediary of some sort”but to be clear a spokesperson for gfsc from the us public relations firm wachsman stated unequivocally that zksnacks is “not regulated in any way by the gfsc or any other regulator in gibraltar”where the stolen bitcoin has landed source ellipticmade in gibraltaralbert isola mp gibraltar’s minister for digital and financial services said firms regulated in the jurisdiction should report suspicious activity to the financial intelligence unit which uses another wellknown blockchain analytics firm called coinfirmasked if the jurisdiction’s financial intelligence unit has received some or any suspicious transaction reports strs relating to wasabi wallet and zksnacks isola said he was not aware how many such reports related to any particular firm“i know that we have a significant number of strs reported by the online gaming community and also by the blockchain community so i know that they are reporting which is what i want to see” isola said adding“i think were in a much better position than we were with cash if i could use that as an example because at least youve got trails and tracks you can follow and you can see the movement of these virtual assets”censorship resistanceelliptic’s robinson said it’s the very fact that wasabi is noncustodial that makes it more attractive than previous bitcoin mixers wasabi’s centralized forebears ran the risk of things like exit scams – not to mention the possibility that such services could be law enforcement in disguiserobinson likened the zksnacks scenario to decentralized exchange dex dydx which runs a centralized order book but remains noncustodial and settlement happens onchain“like wasabi dydx never has control of funds but because they control the order matching they can block orders if they want” said robinson “therefore does that mean that they should be checking whether their customers are sanctioned entities for example and blocking transactions”the fact that zeroknowledge proofs stand in the middle of a protocol like wasabi wallet does not change the fact that a firm like zksnacks should be aware that bitcoin inputs are coming from something like the bitfinex hack and take responsibility robinson argued“they might not know who their users are or where the funds are going but they are helping criminals to hide their tracks” said robinsontoo publica counterargument is that blockchain analytics is not an exact science to begin withfirms that have designed and built platforms to protect the privacy of their users and be censorshipresistant are not about to start blocking those users based on heuristics pointed out wasabi wallet contributor max hillebrand“this sort of analysis is not conclusive and these types of censorship of transactions do not work” hillebrand said in an interview “it doesn’t make sense philosophically and it’s impossible to implement technically therefore we don’t do it”
