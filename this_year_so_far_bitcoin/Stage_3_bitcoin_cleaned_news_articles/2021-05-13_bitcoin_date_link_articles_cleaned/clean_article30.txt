michael sonnenshein grayscale investments ceo joins yahoo finance live to discuss how the environmental impact of mining hit cryptocurrencies and outlook for bitcoin postpandemicvideo transcriptmyles udland i mean look i think in general im always going to be viewing bitcoin as whats its role whats cryptos role within the financial psychological moment right but lets talk a little bit about the actual details here of the energy consumption what it is what it isnt how people in the space are thinking about it lets bring in michael sonnenshein ceo at grayscale investments michael thanks for coming back on the showyouve patiently listened to us discuss elons latest tweet lets start with i guess how you guys at grayscale think about the consumption issue with respect to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies what youre thinking is on that how you counsel clients through that when they ask versions of this question which im sure they domichael sonnenshein well great to be here this is an opportunity for the entire crypto space to really think about moving the narrative toward something thats a little bit more solutions oriented when it comes to energy consumption and its important that we stick to the facts hereif you look at the way that bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency mining currently exists around the world were talking about a mere couple of basis points of global  emissions on an annual basis and because bitcoin mining has gone from something that in the early days could be done on a store bought computer to now seeing the quote unquote new minings of the world being set up and become a really competitive industry youve now seen miners set up geographically all around the world and oftentimes really working to ensure that renewables are part of their energy consumption so things like wind and solar and hydro these are the areas that bitcoin miners are focused on and so i think the latest statistic is about  is the percentage of miners that are using renewables as part of their energy consumptionstory continuesjulie hyman michael is there a way of sourcing of knowing where your bitcoin is sourced and trying to get bitcoin i mean my gut instinct would say no theres not because of the nature of bitcoin but i wonder if there ismichael sonnenshein there actually is right the underlying blockchain technology really does allow for transparency of all transactions that take place in bitcoin and so the ability to look at transactions trace them back through history you can actually see where your bitcoins have resided every address every transaction theyve ever been a part of and again this really represents an opportunity as an industry for us to focus on how renewables can play a role in supporting the bitcoin network and again this is really just one persons opinion that were talking about at the momentjulie hyman oh its one persons opinion but its a pretty influential one isnt it you know michael you may be viewing this as an opportunity now but are you a little annoyed when you saw that tweet is it frustrating to you that something that your business is so connected to can be influenced like this by that guymichael sonnenshein well you guys were talking about volatility in the bitcoin space and in digital currencies in general and thats certainly one of the things that we talk about and that investors know that its not going to be for the faint of heart and so many investors are waking up this morning to see bitcoin down maybe   but if theyre conviction in investing in bitcoin hasnt changed investors view these types of pullbacks as opportunities to average down in their positions and ultimately control more bitcoin in their portfoliosbrian sozzi so michael so traders in crypto they should ignore elon muskmichael sonnenshein i think that that is an accurate statement yes i think traders are looking at fundamentals the role that bitcoin plays in their portfolio achieving higher risk adjusted returns by incorporating digital currencies into a diversified portfolio and again if your conviction hasnt changed and you still believe in the role that bitcoin can play in your portfolio and you can buy it cheaper than you could yesterday thats a compelling dream for a lot of investorsjulie hyman michael thank you for playing along with all of this developing news this morning theres something going on with you guys too that i want to bring up you guys filed this morning to turn into an sec reporting company explain to us what exactly is the significance of this filing and the product it involvesmichael sonnenshein thank you yes so this morning we filed voluntarily form  for our diversified fund which is called grayscale digital large cap it trades under the symbol of gdlc and so if this is deemed effective it would cause the grayscale digital large cap fund to start filing its financials on  and weve already accomplished this with two of our other products in the grayscale family the grayscale bitcoin trust and the grayscale ethereum trust and so what this essentially means is holding the product to a higher level of reporting obligations and risk disclosures and its an important milestone not just for the team not just for this product but also for investors investors are looking to find trustworthy partners to access the digital currency market and if we can continue to provide greater transparency by holding ourselves to that higher standard were certainly going to do itjulie hyman i also have to ask you about your push and the industry push to have a crypto etf a bitcoin etf you guys specifically i know have been working on that gary gensler does not seem on board at least not in the short term i mean what are the odds of this happening at this point say before the end of the yearmichael sonnenshein we continue to believe a bitcoin etf is a matter of when and not a matter of if regulators are as engaged as theyve ever been on the digital currency market theyre looking for certain points of maturation in the underlying market before theyre going to get comfortable approving an etfand certainly in grayscale weve been committed to converting our products in particular our flagship fund grayscale bitcoin trust into an etf when regulatory permissions allow for it and were just not there yet its early days the market is continuing to mature and were committed to working with regulators to get them comfortable to approve these products over timemyles udland all right michael sonnenshein ceo of grayscale investments michael thanks so much for joining today thanks for playing along and i know well talk soon
