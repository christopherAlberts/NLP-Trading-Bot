the coalfired greenidge power plant was shut down in  but it was bought back in  and restarted as a natural gas power station producing power solely for greenidge generations onsite bitcoin mining data center now greenidge which describes itself as the first publicly traded bitcoin miner with its own power station has been given a permit to expand the data center  but local environmental campaigners say the expansion of crypto mining will do environmental harm creating greenhouse gases ghgs and other emissions for no purposebitcoin will fry the worldthe greenidge generation power plant was brought back in  providing power exclusively for cryptocurrency with mining beginning in  the facility built with the help of oconnell electric initially ran  mining rigs using  of power however there are plans to expand this rapidly using up to  of the total  potential output of the greenidge plantin march private equity firm atlas holdings which owns greenidge generation announced it would be merged with nasdaqlisted it company supportcom creating a publiclytraded bitcoin company in september when the merger is expected to be completedat the same time greenidge announced plans to expand up to as much as  of bitcoin mining power consumption by  at the greenidge site and at other similar power plantscryptocurrency mining worldwide is energyintensive and designed to consume ever more energy as mining systems solve math puzzles to generate bitcoin and other tokens bitcoin now consumes more than the entire country of argentina according to the university of cambridge centre for alternative finance this amount is set to grow because the entire cryptocurrency scheme is based on ensuring that it takes evermore power to generate successive coins so it takes the worlds bitcoin mining resources ten minutes to produce each one the more miners there are the more complex the mining calculations become and the greater the emissions created in making the coinswhen greenidge opened its site the  mining rigs could create  bitcoin a day at that time which then had a value of  at time of writing that is about  because it has cheap electricity and does not have to pay to deal with the emissions it can mine bitcoin for around  each and has made a large profit on the  bitcoins it has mined in the year it has been in operationin april the local town of torrey planning board has voted to allow greenidge generation to carry on with its expansion according to weny newsit will construct four buildings at the plant holding around ten thousand bitcoin mining rigs the site would also take on  new staffaround half those at the meeting were against the proposal with environmental campaigners saying the expansion would produce more greenhouse gas emissions as well as emitting pollution and heat into surrounding watersthe facility has permits for greenhouse gases and other emissions but the department of environmental conservation dec said it is reviewing them “as part of dec’s aggressive oversight of this facility and their compliance with our stringent regulatory requirements dec is closely monitoring the operations of greenidge generation a bitcoin mining operation in torrey new york and current proposals for its expansion in addition to ensuring continued compliance with dec’s current permits for the facility dec will ensure a comprehensive and transparent review of its proposed air permit renewals with a particular focus on the potential climate change impacts and consistency with the nationleading emissions limits established in the climate leadership and community protection actas the greenhouse gas emissions associated with this type of facility may be precedential and have broader implications beyond new york’s borders dec will consult with the us epa the climate action council and others as we thoroughly evaluate the complex issues involved”greenidge defends its operations by saying that natural gas is less polluting than coal  though it is still a fossil fuel with greenhouse emissions in theory the plant could also run on methane produced renewably from biomass but that is not happening yetcornell university biochemist robert howarth who is on the new york climate action council told new york focus the proposal made no sense “there really is no room for a massive expansion of fossil fuel use in any sector let alone one with so little true value to new york as represented by a cryptocurrency” he said adding that new york is required by law to reduce its emissions by  percent before  which is already a hard target without greenidge generation ramping uptesla pump and dumpbitcoin prices had increased rapidly in february when elon musk backed the currency and announced tesla had put  billion of its corporate cash into bitcoin and would accept payments in the cryptocurrency this week following criticism that this made a mockery of teslas claims to be an environmentally conscious organization and following tesla making more than  from selling the currency the billionaire reversed that decision pushing bitcoin into a slumpmusks sudden enlightenment came in a tweet which said “we are concerned about  rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions especially coal which has the worst emissions of any fuel”
