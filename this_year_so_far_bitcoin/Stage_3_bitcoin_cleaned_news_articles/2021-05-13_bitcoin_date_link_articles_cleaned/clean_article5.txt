bitcoin’s mining difficulty – a selfcorrecting score that determines the computational effort it takes to mine bitcoin – set a new alltime high thursdaybitcoin’s difficulty adjusted upward  at  trillion after dipping to  trillion in the last adjustment according to this journalist’s bitcoin node this comes after bitcoin’s hashrate which is a measure of the combined computing power of bitcoin’s miners rose to an alltime high this week per multiple sourcesbitcoin’s difficulty is an internal score that begins at  the easiest level and grows or shrinks exponentially depending on how many miners are competing on the network today’s adjustment was the largest in seven years“today’s difficulty increase of  the largest percentage increase since  and it’s also the largest absolute increase in history” compass mining cbo thomas heller told coindesksubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policyabout a month ago coal mining accidents shut down bitcoin miners in xinjiang china clipping roughly  of bitcoin’s hashrate from the network heller commented that these miners have come back online recently leading to the surge in hashrate and by extension difficulty some of these miners have begun migrating machines to sichuan for its incipient rainy season which will supply them with gushes of cheap hydroelectricityon the other side of the world north american pools are growing at a rapid clip and turning on more machines than ever beforeeven as competition escalates to new heights bitcoin miners are making more than they have in two years according to luxor technology’s hashrate indexwhen taprootthis difficulty adjustment also gives mining pools a fresh start to signal for bitcoin’s taproot update an upgrade that outfits bitcoin with new signature and scripting schemes that allow for cheaper more flexible multisignature transactions among other thingstaproot will pave the way for improvements to outstanding technologies like lightning multisignature wallets and bitcoinbased “smart contracts” like discrete log contracts dlcsper rules to coordinate the upgrade at least  of mining pools within any given difficulty period must signal their support for the upgrade using a special identifier in the blocks they mine these periods last  blocks or roughly two weeks miners now have five epochs left to signal if they want taproot to activate in november
