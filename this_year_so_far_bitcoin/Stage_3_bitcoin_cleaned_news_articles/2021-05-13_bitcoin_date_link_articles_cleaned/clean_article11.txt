lose money when a stock rises the action costs the shorts millions driving some of them out of the trade“the markets go through cycles of mania panic and crash” says frank partnoy a business and financial law expert at uc berkeley law school and author of several books on investment fiascos of the past “it feels like there’s a lot of mania in these markets now and some of the reasons are consistent with other periods of history but it’s complicated because it’s driven by investor psychology so it’s hard to disentangle how much of it is legitimate versus illegitimate”advertisementunwary investors have always been vulnerable to being sucked in by dubious investment promotions the  for example featured the original ponzi scheme through which charles

by later clientsperils are heightened during periods of technological and social change after the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in  promoters exploited a mania for railroad investments by showering customers with stocks and bonds that had no detectable relationship to the value of the issuing linesin the  railroad tycoon henry villard discovered that if you didn’t tell investors how you were going to spend their money you could whet their appetiteadvertisementseeking to raise several millions of dollars in capital to take over a company but unwilling to reveal his target for fear of driving its price beyond his reach villard issued a prospectus for a “blind pool” stating that he would reveal “the exact nature” of his plans  days hence investors flocked to his door bidding for twice as much as he had originally sought to raisevillard’s scheme however was unique in its time more recently hundreds of socalled special purpose acquisition companies or spacs have raised billions of dollars for blind pools which promise only to merge with another company they hope to find sometime in the near future thus did villard’s discovery in the  century metastasize into a craze in the partnoy cautions that “in the rearview mirror it’s always easy to say something was a fraud but at the time it’s difficult to tell a fraud from a legitimate innovative new business or technology” early in the  century he says companies that became linchpins of the us economy such as general electric general motors and rca were regarded in some quarters as scamsit’s tempting to caution today’s investors against plunging into investments disconnected from fundamental or intrinsic values the traditional investment standard but the definition of intrinsic value has evolved over

imprudent overleveraged bets can show their intrinsic values to be mythicalstill some features of today’s investment landscape are historically unusual if not necessarily unique one is a long period

of the greenspanbernankeyellen ‘put’” says webber referring to fed chairs alan greenspan ben s bernanke and janet l yellen “people have been trained that the fed is going to have investors’ backs”the fed hasn’t endorsed bitcoin or nfts but investors in the wilder corners of the markets may have the implicit belief that if the broad market went down the investors’ assets would fall too and therefore fed action would protect everyoneanother feature is the disappearance of negative sentiment from the markets “many of the smartest investment professionals have just said they’re not touching shorting anymore” partnoy told mein part that’s because they’ve lost millions betting against a stock market that appears to be relentlessly bullish and on individual companies that have traded well above values as judged by traditional standards — and have never or not yet come back to earth inflationary fears over the last few days have rattled some of the highestflying stocks but that may only be temporaryadvertisementadd the prospect that small investors stirred by reddit might gang up on you and the reluctance of money managers to take a short bet becomes more understandable“you always want to have a balanced set of information about an asset” partnoy said “you want to know that all the people who think it’s great and all the people who think it’s horrible have their information reflected in the price the problem in the market now is that the people who think these investments are bad are not participating in the the market as much as they were”finally
