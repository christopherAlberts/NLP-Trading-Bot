last week in know your options we looked at the futuressettled options on bitcoin available at the cme group cme these have been popular with institutional investors unfortunately a futuresbased product is outside the experience and comfort zone of many individual investorspreviously we’ve addressed the mechanics of trading futures and futureoptions but many traders simply prefer options products that are mechanically identical to the equity options they have already tradedyou may be aware that there are etf products that have one or more commodity products as the underlying the most relevant for our discussion of bitcoin is probably the spdr gold shares gld also known as spdr gold trust  part of the spdr family of etfsmanaged by state street global advisors“the gld”  as it is often referred to in the finance industry – tracks the value of  of an once of gold bullion due to issues surrounding carrying costs and management fees the prices aren’t always exactly identical but because the trustee holds the physical gold to back the shares they never get very far apartthere are also listed options on gld so investors and traders can buy and sell call and puts on an asset that closely foo the pie of the physical commodity if you want to speculate on the price direction of gold the gld options are a simple way to go about ityou may be wondering whether there’s a similar product available that tracks the price of bitcoin on which you might be able to trade optionsif you’re in the united states the answer is “no”for the past several years the securities and exchange commission has been considering the issue of whether to allow one or more etf managers to offer shares that replicate returns on bitcoin it has been reported that newly confirmed sec chairman gary gensler is carefully considering  bitcoin equity products and has accepted preliminary applications for at least  morewith a mandate to protect the interests of investors above all else gensler’s words lately have not been an indication that he’s looking at the prospective products favorably the chairman noted significant price volatility and unknown levels of liquidity as risk factors in what would almost certainly be a very popular productstory continuesthe sec understands that that popularity is likely to lead to herd behavior in which large numbers of investors pile in and out of the shares at the same time increasing price volatility and all but ensuring that may of them will suffer significant lossestheres also an issue of custody of the underlying coins because of the nature of blockchain transactions its not a simple task to ensure that fund managers own the appropriate amount of bitcoin on behalf of the etf holdersfor the time being it doesn’t appear that we’ll see a true btc etf – or associated options contractssome traders are using the shares and listed options of companies who have significant bitcoin exposure as a proxy for owning and equity share version of the coins themselvesfour of those companies are household names in the us – microstrategy mstr tesla tsla square sq and paypal pypl one is a littleknown canadian fintech and personal finance company named mogo mogoon thursday morning mogo turned in its  straight earnings beat as a public companyobviously while these stocks are sensitive to the price of bitcoin their overall value is made up of numerous components – many of which have nothing to do with cryptocurrencyin fact their share price performance over the past year is a reasonable proxy for the proportion of their earnings that has been

trading these stocks or options won’t give you a  performance ratio to the price of bitcoin but it will give you some exposure if you have an opinion about the likely direction of stocks and cryptocurrencies you can make a single trade that encompasses bothas always i’d encourage you to pay attention to the implied vols if you’re bullish on bitcoin then i’d take a look at selling puts on the higher vols names or buying calls on the lower vol names if you’re bearish i’d recommend the opposite – buying cheaper puts or selling those juicy callswe don’t yet have a way to trade listed
