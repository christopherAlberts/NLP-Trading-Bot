gaining exposure to cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies can be part of an overall venture capital vc play rather than a direct investment strategy into a single asset according to two public pension fund investment chiefs from virginia’s fairfax countythe strategy has performed well for the investors who have gained exposure to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin through investments in several private equity funds the two allocators were quick to point out that they are investing in the underlying technology rather than placing bets on which cryptocurrencies will rise to the top“it was more just looking at it from the technology and innovation perspective” said andy spellar investment chief at the fairfax county employees’ retirement systemhe and his colleague katherine molnar cio at the fairfax county police officers retirement system shared their insights wednesday during a panel at the  virtual chief investment officer symposium the event was moderated by chief investment officer managing editor christine giordanoboth investors said they are “very happy” with their investments several years ago the pair invested in the morgan creek blockchain opportunities fund i a private equity vehicle that raised  million from investors in  the fund now is up “between  to  multiples of domestic capital” according to molnarthat was enough to get the pair to reup into the same asset manager’s fund ii a year later cio molnar went a step further than spellar by doubling her police fund’s target in fund ii to  up from  basis points bps in fund iother firms the two investors have gained exposure to coinbase which recently had its initial public offering ipo and a blockchain firm for loans and mortgages called figure as well as a bank for cryptocurrencies known as blockfimolnar’s county police retirement system also put another  of assets into a separate fund manager called blockchain capital for its fund v which has a combination of venture capital investments and some liquid cryptocurrency the pension fund now has  of its assets allocated to the space up from  bps in the investment chief said she could see the allocation growing even higher thus far this year the extra blockchain exposure has helped molnar outperform her colleague spellar’s employees’ retirement system “just by a hair”“it has everything to do with the fact that i sized our blockchain exposure larger than he did on a relative basis” said molnar“she killed me” spellar saidthe peers have maintained similar asset allocations preferring risk allocations to capital allocations meaning the funds have had less equity risk over the years generally speaking this means the two pension funds have lagged behind their peers during market rallies but have performed better during downturns in the twoyear period following the financial crisis the funds were the top public funds in the nationgoing forward the asset owners said they will continue to invest in managers that deal with both cryptocurrency and venture capital rather than investing in each asset class separately “we quite like that combination and tend to think of it as almost like a multistrategy approach” molnar saidspellar and molnar expect it’s “prudent” to start developing relationships with other asset managers that deploy similar strategies as morgan creekthe two peers work within a county retirement structure made of three systems including the fairfax county uniformed retirement system that setup has helped them pool their assets—nearly  billion in the county employees plan and  billion in assets in the county police plan—to negotiate better fees from managers the two have a  target to meet“when we are speaking to a manager we’ll negotiate capacity on behalf of all three systems we’ll negotiate fees you know especially at tiered fee structure” molnar said “so it does give us some leverage”working together has also helped the two allocators communicate the investment to their trustees who were skeptical when they were first considering it in  as the funds were exploring their first investment with morgan creek at the time bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were unproven investments and not considered appropriate for public pension fundsthe two allocators allayed concerns by inviting trustees from all three pension systems along to their meetings with the manager by the time the investment chiefs introduced the fund manager at board meetings the trustees had sat through the same presentations directly from the asset manager “i think that went a long way” spellar said“our skill sets are very complementary so you tend to just end up working on a lot of things together approaching portfolio construction and manager selection”
