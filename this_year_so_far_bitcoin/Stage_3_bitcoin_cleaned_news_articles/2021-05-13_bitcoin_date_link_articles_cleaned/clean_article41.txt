there’s no question that bitcoin often gets sold as an inflation hedge so much of the story is about the fed printing all this money and how there’s only  million bitcoin and so something something something the number will go up due to inflation you’ve heard it a million timeswell today we got one of the hottest inflation prints in years by one measure the consumer price index had its fastest gain since  so how’s bitcoin doing not great here’s the intraday chart with the time of the cpi print marked by the vertical linenow you might say well sure but the hot inflation was wellknown it was priced in in some way and that the number we got today helps explains the extraordinary gains over the last year but that’s pretty weak it’s clear that the cpi reading did in fact surprise other assets fiveyear yields are up substantially on the day showing traders did not anticipate such a big increase in inflationlook to be fair this is just one day and you can’t make big sweeping conclusions about the role an asset plays in global portfolios from four hours of trading nonetheless we do have a few more clues out there in addition to bitcoin selling off we’re seeing tech get hammered down  and the real speculative stuff like the arkk exchangetraded fund down over  so from that perspective it looks like bitcoin is simply behaving as a risky speculative asset which both explains its action today and also over the last year gold is also down on the day speaking of assets missold as an inflation hedgeof course gold highly speculative tech and bitcoin all have something in common which is that they don’t generate cash flow in the here and now when economic growth is sluggish that’s not really a big deal of course ‘cause nobody’s making much money in the first place but when the economy is red hot and you can make good money with lumber or gasoline or chips or labor then why put your money in such futureoriented assets that aren’t paying anything today©  bloomberg
