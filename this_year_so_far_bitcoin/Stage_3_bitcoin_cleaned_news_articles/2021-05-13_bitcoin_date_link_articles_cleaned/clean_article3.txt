novogratz once a partner at goldman sachs who went on to be a hedge fund manager at fortress investment group has found his biggest financial success in cryptocurrency now the billionaire founder and ceo of galaxy digital novogratz is building his own cryptofocused financial empire and has just sealed a deal to buy digital currency trading platform bitgo for  billion the first billiondollar merger in crypto during a virtual interview at the ethereal summit friday – a few days prior to elon musk’s announcement that he was suspending bitcoin payments for teslas over energyuse concerns – novogratz discussed his perspective on the technology how he ended up with  percent of his net worth in crypto and why he keeps losing out on nft auctions the conversation has been edited for length and clarityyour company galaxy digital just acquired bitgo for  billion it was the biggest deal so far in the industry are you looking at more billion dollar deals do you have that kind of dry powderi do think bigger is better going forward for a bunch of different reasons something really cool for us crypto nerds happened in the last six months like we went from hoping to be an asset class to being an institutional asset class like that that means that if you’re not long you’re short so every institution we speak to — whether it’s a corporate financial or tech institution — are trying to find their way into the spacepeople think well what’s the total addressable market of our space who the heck knows it’s growing so fast we’re making money in places we didn’t think we were gonna make money in and i’m sure next year trying to predict my earnings is gonna be really hard we didn’t have an nft business nine months ago because almost no one did but all of a sudden now nfts are in inning one of a nineinning gamesomething else that’s changed this year is that coinbase went public which is a huge change on wall street and galaxy itself is planning an ipo later this year how does that change things from your perspective and what do you say to people who are concerned about seeing crypto go wall streeti spent my last six years literally trying to convince people that this revolution was worthwhile because it was going to help us rebuild the financial infrastructure of our country to make it more transparent more egalitarian more fair more efficient we have a capitalism that’s broken i don’t want to replace capitalism with socialism we need to fix capitalism because right now it’s not working for a ton of people when people ask me about dogecoin or gamestop this is a young generation screaming out and basically given the middle finger to the system and saying hey screw you guys there’s a nihilism almost to itand so i’ve been trying to focus on the constructive side of that revolution this is more than just a financial game this is a revolution and so i think the more people we can bring in the tent the better there are lots of investors whose first exposure to our space is going to be through public equities that’s what they’re used to that’s what they’re comfortable with i think to be in this business you’ve got to be willing to eat your arm and then grow a new one cut your foot off and grow a new one right because you’re not going to go from where we were to where we could go overnightbut we’re a long way from i think a decentralized world and the question i have and it’s a real question — it’s not a statement — is will the consumer care right it’s the back of the tv to the consumer so does he even know the difference and if consumers trust us well what’s the big deal until one day we get really drunk and decide to play funny tricks on ’em you’ve got a lot of blockchains that i call binos — blockchains in name only a blockchain is not a blockchain is not a blockchain they’re not all the same and i don’t think the consumer or the investor has put a lot of thought into thatyou’ve predicted before that bitcoin will hit  by the end of the year you also predicted in january that ether would reach  in january and we’ve already blown way past that — it’s lately been trading around  so are you revising your projection for etheryou know hats off to all the etherheads out there i think we saw something really awesome in the last few months and it was a confluence of kind of three tailwinds all at the same time we already had payments and stable coins that really kind of gave ether the kick last year but then all of a sudden you have decentralized finance and nfts both on ethereum at the same time roughly with wild accelerating growth and you start believing hey this will be the supercomputer that authenticates all this stuff that’s happening listen all markets correct almost  percent certainty it will happen — it’s just the math but it’s pretty staggering and listen ether looks likely to go a lot higher nowhow much higher do you thinkyou know it’s dangerous to give predictions on the highs but could it get to  of course it couldi remember talking to you at the end of  and you were saying about  percent of your net worth was in bitcoin ether and some other cryptos what are you at now how are you thinking about your portfolio and the role of these things in itlike anybody in crypto the last five months have kind of rocked our worlds in terms of what percentage of our net worth is in crypto and i think i’m up to  percent in crypto i have lots of other investments that i love the mushroom company that i’ve been involved in and bojangles the chicken company it’s just that cryptos had a move that is a onceinageneration move and i think people should understand that it’s not going to keep happening over and over like this idea that we’ve gone from notanassetclass to an asset class only can happen oncebut this wild acceleration that we’re seeing where things are up  times  times  times that’s not normal it doesn’t happen very often people in the space should kiss their boyfriend or kiss their girlfriend and give each other a hug because it’s fun to have been in the space when this stuff happens be prudent take some chips and buy yourself a house if you can afford it or a car or at least at least a nice new jacket you know take some of those profits and put them into some joyful thingsdoes that mean you’re selling a little bit now or buying or hodlingwell listen i’m lucky enough that i had wealth outside of crypto wealth i’m as bullish as i’ve been on the space but i see lots of people that have gone from one lifestyle to having the possibility of really having changed their life and i’m like guys be prudent take a little bit off the tablewe were talking about nfts earlier and you mentioned that you haven’t actually bought any nfts yourself yet but you are excited about them tell me about thati bid on a bunch and i keep missing out on these auctions not the beeple one but i did bid on the urs fischer urs he’s an awesome artist i’ve been trying to buy one of his sculptures for a whole lot of money and the nft seemed cheap  i find this to be a fascinating space — i think it’s going to revolutionize the way we think about ip about creativity about engagement and i think we literally have no idea where it’s going partly because how we display our nfts that part of the equation isn’t even close to being started yet right i’m thinking if you buy the  million beeple you want to show it off well that means i want to be able to go to my house and have a giant screen in my living room that’s cool as can be where my nfts can show up i want to meet you in the metaverse and maybe we’re having tea in my man cave and i can pull down the beeple and we can play each one of the  individual images that make it up and blow them up and look at themwhen i was talking to urs fischer he was doing this egg with a big lighter in it he loves to combine objects and it was really cool i’m bummed i missed it but i was thinking in the future we’ll wear these ar glasses and i can walk down the street with my urs egg floating on my shoulder and people will be like dude he bought that fucking egg you know like an amusement park almost but people were like dude you’re so wrong you’re so old like we’re gonna live in the metaverse starting now so i tried real hard to be gen z — but then i kicked right back into boomer mode
