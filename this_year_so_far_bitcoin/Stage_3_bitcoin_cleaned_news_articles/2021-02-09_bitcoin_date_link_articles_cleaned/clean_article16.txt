in  an individual known only by the pseudonym satoshi nakamoto created what has become the worlds largest cryptocurrency bitcoin cryptobtc since that time bitcoin prices have skyrocketed and plunged repeatedly in a dizzying display of volatility but those frenetic price swings are just one of the reasons bitcoin can be a risky place to invest your moneyif concerns about this digital currency have led you to avoid betting directly on an asset class that has no clear investment thesis or on a digital currency thats relatively difficult to spend in the real world both paypal nasdaqpypl and square nysesq are companies that now offer some bitcoin exposure without the same level of riskheres what investors should knowthe importance of bitcoinin may  square started allowing cash app users to buy and sell bitcoin paypal followed suit with its digital wallet in  and it plans to add the feature to venmo in the summer of  whats more a report by pantera capital indicates that both fintech companies are aggressively buying the digital currency new bitcoins are created according to a fixed formula and the amount of new coins created will eventually stop when it reaches  million according to pantera capital square and paypal together are buying more than  of newly mined bitcoins currently out there in other words they are purchasing every new token created as well as some already in circulationduring paypals recent earnings call ceo dan schulman indicated that users responded with overwhelming enthusiasm to the companys bitcoin launch even more exciting schulman reiterated the companys plan to enable bitcoin as a payment method at any of paypals  million merchants later this quarterwhile paypal just started offering this service and has yet to provide specific financial details bitcoin has become a major contributor to squares top line in fact bitcoin sales have risen from  million in the first quarter of fiscal  to  billion in the third quarter of fiscal   thats a  increase in less than three yearshowever bitcoin revenue comes with incredibly low margins  in the most recent quarter squares gross margin on bitcoin was just  in other words despite accounting for the majority of squares revenue bitcoins contribution to the bottom line is negligible so whats the pointfor both paypal and square bitcoin is a way of engaging users its one more feature that enhances their mobile app ecosystems and as these fintech companies add new users it becomes more likely that those users will engage in other profitgenerating activitiesfor example squares cash app also allows users to send peertopeer transfers instantly transfer funds to bank accounts receive direct deposits buy and sell stocks and make purchases using the square cash card and users who adopt two or more of those services transact three to four times more frequently and generate three to four times more gross profit than other users additionally in the third quarter of fiscal   of cash app consumers were daily users compared to  in the third quarter of fiscal  in other words squares strategy is working and paypal will likely see similar benefitsthe benefits of square and paypalcompared to purchasing bitcoin outright  which is a risky investment for a number of reasons  square and paypal both have thriving businesses outside of cryptocurrencythese fintech companies have developed highly engaging product ecosystems that empower both sellers and consumers whether its the ability to accept digital payments invest in cryptocurrency or transfer money to friends or family both paypal and square provide truly valuable services moreover both have built sizable networks protected by strong moats creating a barrier to entry something bitcoin lacks and that has translated into tangible wealth and significant revenue growthmetric  ttm change paypal revenue  billion  billion  square revenue  billion  billion finally digital payments and ecommerce are only becoming more prevalent around the world and in the years ahead the tailwinds from those trends should help paypal and square continue to create value for all stakeholders even if bitcoins value evaporatesa final wordno investment is without risk nor is any asset class guaranteed to gain value over time but bitcoins volatility and questionable longterm utility makes it unusually risky in my opinion even compared to some of the most volatile stocksalternatively paypal and square allow investors to benefit from the mania surrounding bitcoin while avoiding actual exposure to the cryptocurrency put another way shareholders of paypal and square benefit from the buying and selling of bitcoin not the value of a currency prone to wild fluctuations thats why ill take these two fintech companies over bitcoin any day of the week
