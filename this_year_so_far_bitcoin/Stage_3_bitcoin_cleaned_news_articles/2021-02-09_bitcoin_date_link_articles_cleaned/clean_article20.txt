welcome to state of crypto a coindesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government i’m your host nikhilesh deare governments worrying more about the growth of crypto two countries already announced cryptorelated bans though this could be an extension of previous efforts at controlling the space – and their own economies – rather than new initiativesclick here to sign up for state of cryptothe crackdown begins againthe narrativein recent weeks both india and nigeria have made noises about banning crypto industry participants’ access to the traditional banking sector this could be a sign of renewed government crackdowns on the spacewhy it mattersbitcoin and subsequent cryptocurrencies were designed to be censorshipresistant stateless and a tool of economic freedom citizens in belarus and nigeria used bitcoin to raise funds for those who lost their jobs or otherwise faced repercussions for protesting against authoritarian regimes people in other countries use cryptocurrencies as a way of cheaply transferring value across bordersbut the crypto space might not yet be mature enough to actually fulfill those goals – at least not entirely ray dalio head of major hedge fund bridgewater associates said government prohibition could have a significant negative impact on cryptocurrency adoption and we’re indeed seeing governments try to enact or enforce stringent regulationbreaking it downthe indian government began considering a bill that would ban private cryptocurrencies late last month defining “private” as any cryptocurrency that’s not statebacked the bill which was introduced to the lok sabha the lower house of the indian parliament also suggested that india could launch its own central bank digital currency cbdc issued by the reserve bank of india rbi the nation’s central bankthere are two details here that stick out to me the first is that the rbi tried to restrict cryptocurrencies once before when it told banks they could not provide services to crypto companies in  that ban was later struck down by the nation’s supreme court though rbi vowed to fight the ruling this new bill which was also introduced in the rajya sabha the upper house could be a natural evolution of that policy goal one that would have the force of law behind itthe second detail is the indian government has also tried to control its financial system before in  the government demonetized the ₹ and ₹ notes some  of the circulating currency nominally in an effort to stamp out “black money” or cash held from illicit means in  india’s aadhaar system decided every resident effectively needed access to the biometric identification platform in order to buy a cell phone or access banking servicesa continent away the central bank of nigeria cbn published a document saying banks cannot provide crypto exchanges with services binance and bundle africa immediately announced they would suspend depositshere too the cbn says its ban isn’t new but rather that its statement last week is merely reiterating a position it has held since  still the timing of the move is interesting coming just months after residents began using bitcoin to raise funds as part of the endsars movementbasically this looks like a trend crypto is getting to a place where governments have to pay attention to it some industry insiders seem less alarmed about nigeria’s ban than their indian counterparts are about the subcontinent’s banus congressmeanwhile congress is gearing up to face a number of issues this year beginning with an impeachment trial
