recorded on may  jason moser its monday may  im your host jason moser on this weeks financial show were going to dig a little bit deeper into the prospects of inflation how that relates to all of the volatility weve seen in the crypto markets recently sofi is getting ready to go public were going to talk a little bit more about that and what investors can expect as well as some recent earnings from sofi also square is raising some money well talk a little bit about what they might do with the  billion that they are going to be raising as always well have one to watch for you to wrap up the show and as always ive got my partner in crime here with me this week its certified financial planner mr matt frankel matt how is everything goingmatt frankel just great its a brutally hot day in south carolinamoser it was brutally hot here in virginia yesterday but it cooled down a little bit today we got a nice little break from things i guess for guys like you we were talking before taping theyre in the middle of installing the pool at your house and the heat im sure has just got you very impatientfrankel yes very much so my kids more than me dont understand why they cant just go jump in it right nowmoser isnt that always the way well matt this has been an interesting week here there has been a lot of volatility and a lot of news a lot of headlines devoted to cryptocurrencies recently well talk a little bit about that coupled with that though the results  we saw an interesting article here recently in the wall street journal that talked a little bit more about inflation and exactly how that may be presenting itself in the economy today lets talk a little bit first about inflation where we think things could be headed and what that could mean for investors because generally speaking when you talk about inflation thats not something that is clearly detrimental to stocks but its absolutely something that can play into growth expectations and performance investors need to take this stuff they need to keep this stuff in mind as we see the potential here for inflation to start im going to possibly accelerate a little bit here in the coming months and even quartersfrankel right now we just saw the april inflation data showed that consumer prices rose a little over  yearoveryear  thats definitely above the feds  inflation target the question is are we going to see a short term bump in inflation due to the reopening just a one time demand rushes into the market we see a little inflation all of a sudden worse it can be more of a prolonged trend as theyve thrown trillions of dollars of stimulus into the economy theyve been printing money for a couple of years now is that going to cause a lot of inflationary pressure on the back endweve recently seen wage growth is at the highest its been in a long time which could also help play into inflation its not necessarily a good or bad thing for your stock portfolio it depends what youre investing in the traditional hedge against inflation is always thought to be gold or silver precious metals things like that which to be fair does a pretty good job of keeping up with inflation overtime not much more but they do hedge against inflation well get into the cryptocurrencies in a minute and im sure jason has an opinion on it as i do but as far as the stock market goes if youre worried about inflation the best advice i can give is stick with companies that have a lot of pricing powerfor example if consumer prices rise by  apple has the ability to raise the price of their iphone by  and people are still going to buy it there are industries that are a lot more competitive and dont have quite as much pricing power so thats one thing to ask yourself if inflation really picks up what companies will be able to take advantage of the increases in prices being that this is the financial show banks are somewhat inflation protected because inflation generally comes with rising interest rates which if you are a business that lends money thats a good thing its a fine balance between supply and demand if inflation stays at  like it is now which is a pretty elevated rate that could be a good thing for banks if rates tend to tick up if inflation jumps to  and interest rates really skyrocket out of control that will hurt consumer demand and its bad for banks banks are what i call a moderate inflation hedge they tend to do well in periods of decent but controlled inflation then there are the big box stores and the dollar stores and things like that that tend to do pretty well during inflationary times because if youre going to go grocery shopping for example youre not going to get much cheaper than walmart or costco those tend to get people spending money no matter what the economy is doingits not necessarily that you need to be outofstocks and into gold silver or cryptocurrencies if you believe inflation is really going to stay elevated for a while its just to make sure you focus on the right companies that wont get crushed in an inflationary environmentmoser yeah i think youre right there and inflation its an interesting thing to observe because one of the things that stands out to me just recently or at least looking at last week through the earnings releases and the calls for home depot and lowes in the theme over the past couple of quarters if youve been anywhere near the housing market then you probably know this but lumber prices have really taken off lumber prices have really taken off and what you see in the language in these calls is that while home depot and lowes are able to continue selling that lumber because they typically have to thats thats a unique market they do start to recognize some gross margin pressure from that lumber they can only price it so much they can only realize so much pricing power on something like lumber before it starts to cap out and you see a little bit of gross margin pressure there to me that was one thing that stood outbut also i wonder in regard to inflation it seems like right now weve got a lot of interesting things going on weve got the economy reopening weve got a lot of stimulus out there weve got folks who should have in theory some money to spend it sounds like but weve also seen a supply chain crunch im not talking about just semiconductors either this really does seem to be extending across all areas of the economy there are just some supply chain issues that are playing out when you start to have a limited supply of things and youve got a surplus of the hot dollar surplus of money out there for people to be spending those are the conditions that inflation just lovesfrankel for sure were definitely seeing a supply chain crunch thats why the lumber market is going so crazy a lot of that is supply chain so yeah that also can create inflationary pressures like you said there are certain things where there isnt that much pricing power you can only raise prices on lumber so much before people are going to stop building decks on their house and pump the brakes on unnecessary spending but at the same time i think like milk the price of milk can double and people are still going to buy the price of gas could double which it almost has from the past year the price of gas could double and people are still going to fill their tanks up there are a lot of industries that do have a lot of pricing power youll see demand bend a little bit but demand is a lot more flexible in some industries than othersmoser yeah relatively elastic id say its just its not going to really change much the gas is a perfect example there there was an interesting data point i was reading when i was reading through this piece and it just struck me that this is why we talk about it this data right here from early  through last december shows that stocks deliver positive inflation adjusted returns in  of rolling  periods that occurred when inflation was below  and rising now that number  falls to  during periods of time when inflation was above  and rising for those who asked why we are talking about this thats why were talking about it because there is data out there that shows it does matter you have to be maybe a little bit more picky when it comes to your stock purchasesnow the flip side its not just stocks that do this dance when inflation starts becoming more part of the conversation you mentioned gold and silver as being traditional hedges i think a lot of people are familiar with those recently clearly weve been talking more and more about cryptocurrencies lately bitcoin being the standard i guess but then all of these other coins that come with the conversation crypto i think theres just a million different opinions out there you either buy into it or you dont i think its probably safe to say that you and i are both a bit more on the skeptical side of things but generally speaking why would crypto be seen as a hedge to inflationfrankel well first of all in the words of ringo starr i say this with peace and love  i think the last week or so the price action in crypto currencies has shown that it is not a store of value yet whatever side of the argument youre on whether cryptocurrency is the future of finance or not a store value doesnt lose  of its value in a week thats not a story value thats literally the opposite of the store value thats evaporating value  ethereum is the other one which i actually think has more potential than bitcoin in a lot of ways its down  in the past week in one week i dont know if thats ever happened with the us dollar where its lost  of its value against any other major world currency in the span of a week its not there yet the big argument why bitcoin is a hedge if you ask certain people is because theres a finite amount of it same reason that gold is a hedge the government cant just print more gold the government cant just print more bitcoin i buy that to a certain extent if we had reached the point where bitcoin was widespread adoption it was a readily usable currency it was an accepted store value by more than just  of the population which it is right now were just not at the point where you can call bitcoin a store of value and you have to have it be a store of value before you can really call it a hedge against inflation the recent price action really in my mind invalidates the hedge argumentmoser yeah i think that makes perfect sense it really all boils down to the finite supply that makes perfect sense lets fast forward  years are we there in  years where bitcoin can be seen by most as a reasonable store of value i would assume that the way things are going were probably going to continue to grow at least folks who see the merits of cryptocurrencies in whatever shape or form theres going to be i think continued adoption albeit probably somewhat slowly for the masses but at some point or another maybe well get there its not to say we would never get therefrankel there you go trying to bait me again  i think its a mistake for anybody to think of it as a given that we are eventually going to get to mass adoption of cryptocurrencies thats still very up in the air at this point during some of our bitcoin data reviews one of our experts that i interviewed im not sure which one off the top of my head but one of them referred to whats going on right now as an inflection point where were either going to see bitcoin accelerate into mass adoption or not its not going to keep going at its current pace where youre going to have  adoption that subset of the population just believes in bitcoin forever youre either going to see it really start gaining traction or go the other way i really think its a very binary outcome i personally dont think its going to get there im very skeptical of the longterm use case of bitcoinwhen you hear about all these projects being done on the blockchain and things like that like mastercard and visa and all these other fintechs have their own blockchain divisions that are developing blockchain finance programs and things like that generally thats on the ethereum blockchain i could see that having more staying power than bitcoin but i really dont think youre going to see bitcoin become a mainstream currency i just dont i like the concept i like the technology i mine bitcoin ive used bitcoin i lived off bitcoin for a day in las vegas just to see if i can do it so like i said i say this with peace and love i just dont see it getting theremoser yeah i tend to agree with you but by the same token as an investor one of the things ive just learned is you just always keep an open mind im going to keep an open mind to it it doesnt mean im interested in it i dont care about it i still dont see the use case for it i agree with what youre saying i also wouldnt be surprised at all if  years from now maybe we did see some change in the mentality or some material used cases for it and other cryptos its going to be an interesting story to follow theres no question about itfrankel sure if you and i are wrong and it does gain mass adoption in  years bitcoin could be  millionmoser yes finite supply absolutely could befrankel my prediction is that in  years bitcoin will either be over  or under  nowhere in the middle im either going to be really right or really wrong say what you will over the past  years of bitcoins existence it hasnt done a lot of just buttering along its either gone up or down or straight up or straight down so if the past  years continues bitcoins  million in  years but interest can really evaporate quickly if it doesnt pan out so i think its going to be really high or really lowmoser yeah i think that interest is going to be key if something like  of the population right now has dabbled a toe in the crypto space were going to need to obviously have a lot more than that to create the ongoing interest otherwise youre right i will have a hard time so yeah its going to be an interesting one to followup for sure matt a company that you and i like to talk about a lot on this show is getting ready to start trading on the public markets here it looks like sofi social finance technology is going to begin trading on tuesday june  a week from tomorrow were going to see sofi out there on the public markets you recently have just gone through some earnings results for the business and you were impressed with what you sawfrankel yeah assuming everything goes according to plan where theyre meeting and the shareholder vote and all that theyll be trading on the  which is the first trading day after the memorial day weekend it will be on the nasdaq the current symbol ipoe the spac is on the new york stock exchange so its moving exchanges at that time the shares and the warrants which everyones you own will automatically convert over to the new ticker symbol theres nothing you need to do if you still own the original units if it was the ipoe units those will automatically break apart into shares and warrants of sofi upon closing just so you know what to expect there is nothing you need to do looking at the results they pretty much knocked it out of the park first quarter net revenue was  million they had been guiding for  so they came in above the high end of their own guidance rangemoser nicefrankel their earnings were a little over  million theyve been guiding for a loss of  million to a gain of  million so they blew that expectation out of the water too on the top and the bottom lines they really just smashed their own expectations their member count is  million thats  higher than it was a year agomoser wowfrankel this is the  consecutive quarter where their growth rate has accelerated and its pretty impressive if you remember a year or so ago they acquired galileo its the backend fintech infrastructure platform they provide thirdparty infrastructure services they now have  million client accounts up from  million a year ago the galileo platform is one of the big biggest parts of my thesis on the company they originated  billion of loans in the quarter a little less than half of that was personal loans and they had some student loans that was what sofi was originally founded to do they expect just under  billion of revenue this year which is pretty impressive that would be  growth over  theyre just starting to launch some new verticals auto loans they are really just ramping up their brokerage business theyre just getting their banking charter if you remember sofi just acquired a small bank for the purpose of accelerating that process its putting a lot of its own capital behind it so the numbers look pretty impressive and the shares are up significantly since that was announced i think its pretty plain to see why these numbers were just impressive all aroundmoser yeah it sounds like anthony noto has got the business really headed in the right direction i remember at the time when he left twitter to go to sofi it was a little curious but now it makes a whole heck of a lot more sense he really did seem to get in with the business there at the right time to help them start building up what i think is something pretty special here it seems like theyre on to something big including all of the numbers that youve just gone over the initiatives are leading to a business and the investors really had to have this one on their radarfrankel i was thrilled when they announced that this was going to be their merger target for ipoe and im not planning on selling my shares ive added to my position since they announced it im a big sofi fan i think theyre a very disruptive financial company and i think they could be the next square in my portfoliomoser wow well theres some conviction for you folks listen up because mr frankel has got a track record and its a pretty darn good one  so keep that in mind matt thanksfrankel i got it on square three days after its ipomoser thats not bad timingfrankel technically i got into sofi three months before its ipo since it was a spac dealmoser wow oh my goodnessfrankel well see i havent won the sofi bet yet thats early stagemoser but it looks like at least things are headed the right direction speaking of square weve got some interesting news here recently square is going to be raising some money here it looks like they are issuing some debt to the tune of  billion matt taking advantage of what is still a very low interest rate environment i think if i see this correctly senior notes  stretched out to  thats one tranche then in the other tranche a  stretched out to  at   billion to me they offer up just the standard we can use for general corporate purposes which may include potential acquisitions transactions this is something i feel they are going to be investing a lot here into the square capital side of the business i mean this is the next act for this business dont you thinkfrankel in a way this move left me with more questions than answers i will tell you why square already had  billion unrestricted cash just sitting on its balance sheet why do they need another  billion i feel like if you already have over  billion in cash and you decide to raise another  billion in cash you need to give me something more than were going to use for general corporate purposes  youre right its a very low cost of capital thats never really been a problem for square i think their last offering correct me if im wrong was convertible notes at  interest that could just be converted to stock sometime in the future theyve never had a problem accessing low cost capital and this was a private placement to institutional investors i know they are going to be building up the square capitali mentioned so far as a bank they are putting i think  million of their own capital behind to build out their bank square will conceivably be bigger as a bank just because theyre bigger business right now they didnt need more capital for the first square capital i would like some more guidance apparently investors agree by the way the stock was down  right after they announced that so the market reacted negatively to this and normally if someones raising lowcost if square was raising capital with those interest rates you said so an average of about  and we knew they were going to turn that into something that was going to be at  return or something to that effect of course the market will be cheering that when real estate stocks raise low cost capital its often cheered by the market so i think it was the question of why are you raising this if berkshire hathaway which is what we talked about has  billion or whatever on the balance sheet if they came out tomorrow and say were going to raise  billion of fresh debt wouldnt your reaction be whymoser well i mean normally id like to know at least what they are trying to do with it and i mean its a good point therefrankel i feel like general corporate purposes just dont cut it when you already have that much you want moremoser no its a cop out and its obviously just the cut and paste statement but now you made me think about it a little bit more i wonder if i mean you cant help but wonder if maybe theyve got a target or two in across areas for potential acquisition herefrankel thats thought and maybe the latest cant saymoser maybefrankel i wouldnt be surprised to see square go after like and so fire or something like thatmoser yeah well i mean after everything you just said about being so fay it actually wouldnt shock maybe they seem to be very in line with with leadership i mean clearly jack and anthony have a history i mean they know each other i mean they had a good relationship so yes that will be interesting to seefrankel there are a lot of i mean square recently acquired titles which i didnt see that coming honestly but there are a lot of them that i could see going out even like robinhood i could see square doing that because it would bring tens of millions of new customers into their ecosystemmoser yes yes it wouldfrankel i could see that i mean just the customer acquisition alone would be worth that acquisitionmoser i would imagine matt imagine theyd be like hey listen guys we just want your customers we really dont want your business or any of your policies you can keep all that stuff we just want customersfrankel or maybe one of the smaller crypto exchanges to help better compete with coin base or something to that like a gemini i could definitely see them going after a company like that i mean i hope they are building a war chest to really build out our ecosystem its my hope but the market was not happy with the general corporate purposes type thing because what do you need that for come onmoser well matt lets take a stronger stance than for our listeners here as we wrap up before we take off lets take a strong stance for our listeners here with our ones to watch what is the stock that you are watching this weekfrankel were such a strong stance ill give you a  im watching two of my favorite spacs this week and for good reason the first one is an ipo that is social capital hedosophia holdings vi thats why we just call it ipof did not have to say that name this is chamaths big spac they raised  billion in  latest rumors they are going to be taking equinox public the fitness company that competes with peloton a lot of investors are in  which is why ipof really hasnt moved since that rumor started trickling out if anything the stock is down a little bit but we havent seen the terms of the deal or anything and chamath has been really good about getting a good deal if im investing in a predeal stock i like anything that is at the right price so im curious to see what it does with it i think that could be a good competitor for peloton and im interestedthen pershing square nysepsth tarantin holdings bill ackmans spac ackman said a couple of weeks ago that he hopes to have been talking to iconic company he hopes to have a deal finalized within weeks this is his words ackmans words so we could hear very soon a lot of people think its stripe i dont know i dont know if id call stripe an iconic company i think that might be bloomberg which was the other big rumor play the bloomberg media empire taking that public so im watching those two spacs because i have a feeling the next couple of weeks will be very interesting for both of themmoser yes that is really cool thatll be well worth watching im veering away a little bit from the financial markets here but a business i think we really all investors should at least take note of autodesk ticker there as adsk autodesk earnings will be coming out this week thursday after the market closes i believe they will be releasing their earnings report and autodesk is in  design engineering entertainment software that autocad product with computer aided design that they provide very strong reputable business it has been at it for a while subscription style subscription revenue accounted for  of total revenue now net revenue retention rate stays in that  and  range so they get their customers they keep their customers they continue to roll out new services for their customers it was interesting the management sees things coming back so theres a whole reopening i mean people getting back to work businesses opening their doors they expect the back half of this year to be strong as such theyre actually considering introducing a potentially consumptionbased dynamic to their business model just to be able to accommodate the customers that would need ithonestly to me that seems a bit like a cloudflare type of thing to do for those who know cloudflare they have everything from the usage base to the subscription model and offering what your clients what your customers need i think is a very customercentric thing to do but they are calling for earnings of  at the midpoint for the year that puts shares around  times earnings today which are  times fullyear estimates which is clearly not cheap but you are also getting a very strong business that generates a lot of money a lot of cash lot of earnings so id be very interested to hear what they have to say just generally speaking about the business environment and how they see the rest of this year playing out because theres been a lot of good news thats come out since they reported last so a company i own a company i recommend and that will be what im keeping my eye on this week but matt i think that is going to do it for us this week as always thanks so much for jumping on and sharing all of your knowledgefrankel of course its always fun to be here hopefully next time i will have a pool that i can actually use and not just look atmoser well well record from the pool we could hear ashes and just the sound of joy well be waiting for that im excited for you man that will be
