by now youve probably heard of dogecoin cryptodoge the memeinspired cryptocurrency that skyrocketed  over the past year those lifechanging gains have captured the interest of investors and the hunt is on for the next moonshotto that end oxen  formerly known as loki  currently trades at  per token and it has a market value of just  million notably oxen offers far greater utility than dogecoin which could help it gain traction heres what investors should knowwhat is oxenoxen tokens are the currency of the oxen blockchain a network that supports anonymous communications and transactions over the internet to understand exactly what that means lets backtrack and start with bitcoinpeople often confuse bitcoins decentralized nature with privacy and anonymity but the bitcoin blockchain is by design transparent when transactions occur miners pull data into blocks validate the blocks by solving cryptographic puzzles then store the blocks on the publicly accessible blockchainthe data within those blocks is pseudonymous ie it doesnt include your name but it does record your unique bitcoin address  think of this like an email address  and that can be linked to a wallet and wallets can be linked to users in fact companies like chainalysis design software to track blockchain transactionsto avoid this you could use a system of multiple different wallets and create a new bitcoin address for every transaction but doing this manually would get tedious and confusing thats why oxen was createdoxen employs three strategies that effectively maintain user anonymity first it uses ring signatures again this is easier to understand in the context of bitcoina bitcoin address is a public key to which bitcoin can be sent it is paired with a private key that allows a user to sign transactions and prove ownership this makes it possible to send and receive bitcoin notably anyone can verify the signature using the public key put another way a users bitcoin address  which is stored in the public blockchain  could be used to verify a signature thereby linking the user to a transactionring signatures make this impossible rather than one person digitally signing a transaction oxens system creates a ring of at least  signers all but one of which are decoyssecond oxen uses stealth addresses to prevent the receivers public key from being linked to any transaction it does this by creating a onetimeuse address with each transfer this allows an individual to accept a transaction without revealing their public address which means that address is never recorded in the blockchainthird oxen uses ringct protocol to verify the amount being sent is greater than zero and to ensure that no one can see the transaction sizeto summarize bitcoin and oxen are both decentralized blockchains that rely on a network of miners to validate transactions but bitcoin prioritizes transparency while oxen prioritizes privacy to that end oxen makes it impossible to identify a signer link a transaction to an address or see the amount of currency being transactedwhy is oxen better than dogecoindogecoin was created without real purpose other than its redditfueled rise to fame theres nothing remarkable about it its not the largest or the most popular cryptocurrency like bitcoin it wasnt built to support decentralized applications like ethereum and its wasnt designed for privacy like oxennotably oxens anonymity gives rise to several use cases that could make it more popular than dogecoinfirst blink is oxens payments platform it combines the security of the oxen network with onesecond transaction times making it the first and only privacycentric digital coin to offer nearinstant paymentssecond session is an encrypted messenger platform built on the oxen blockchain it supports anonymous communications without requiring a phone number or email address and without recording a users ip address if youre curious the session app can be downloaded on apple and android devicesfinally lokinet is a routing platform that utilizes the oxen blockchain to anonymize voice and video calling applications and web browsing this effectively creates a private internetall of these use cases address privacy concerns which have become a hot topic in recent years in  alphabet announced that it would stop supporting thirdparty tracking cookies making it difficult to serve targeted ads in its chrome browser and apple recently upgraded its ios operating system to the same effecthowever alphabet and apple still have consumer information and that data is still stored on central servers that they control so for privacyconscious individuals oxen solves that problem whether youre making payments chatting through the internet or browsing the web oxen allows it to happen anonymously while storing data in a decentralized fashionshould you buy oxenthe technology behind oxen is interesting and it certainly required much more planning than dogecoin  which was developed in roughly two hours according to creator billy markus moreover oxen addresses growing concerns about big data and user privacyon the other hand its still a relatively new cryptocurrency and its currently traded on just six cryptocurrency exchanges put another way oxen is far from mainstreamheres my advice if you want to pursue cryptocurrency as an investment strategy keep this one on your watch list but i wouldnt jump in just yet
