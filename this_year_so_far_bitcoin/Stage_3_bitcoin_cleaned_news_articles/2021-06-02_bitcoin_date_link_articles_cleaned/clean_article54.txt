in this issueis india’s central bank greenlighting crypto thailand’s sec tries to rein in defi with new rules bitcoin transaction fees plummet to new lows cardano rolls out alonzo upgrade in prep for defi will china’s future digital yuan offer smart contractsfrom the editor’s deskdear readerin asia “face” — maintaining one’s outward dignity — counts for a lot and this week many faces were on displayat india’s central bank red faces might have been the order of the day on monday the reserve bank of india was busy trying to keep face while covering the opposite part of its anatomy the rbi appeared finally to have been compelled to admit that its crypto banking ban imposed back in  was no longer the law of the land it issued a circular conceding —  months after the supreme court struck it down — that the ban was “no longer valid”the central bank’s volteface appeared to have been prompted by a backlash among commercial bank customers angered by warnings not to trade cryptocurrencies in some cases accompanied by threats to suspend or close customers’ accountsas the rbi stopped the banks’ embrace of its earlier stance on crypto it nonetheless managed a parting shot reminding lenders to pay careful attention to due diligence — presumably lest the crypto community get the impression that they had chalked up a victorywho says there’s no grace — or face — in defeatface of a different sort has been on display elsewhere in asia in the past weekin china former central bank director yao qian addressed comments by us federal reserve chairman jerome powell who said the country’s prototype digital currency was another means by which beijing would surveil its own populationin a bravefaced response strong on defense but perhaps ironic yao noted that chinese authorities could snoop on individuals’ financial affairs already courtesy of the ubiquitous use of payment platforms such as alipay and wechat payand in thailand the securities regulator put on its game face as it limbered up to bring order to the field of decentralized financealthough thailand’s securities and exchange commission may share a name with its us counterpart that may be as far as comparisons go given the respective institutional muscle of the two regulators it’s even been suggested that the thai watchdog may have bitten off more than it can chew as it tries to regulate defi — a sector already notorious for its amorphous qualitiesthailand’s “land of smiles” visage may slip once its sec begins to grapple with a sector that can’t always be taken at face valueuntil the next timeangie laufounder and editorinchiefforkastnews is india’s central bank greenlighting cryptoindia’s central bank is now telling the public that its  crypto banking ban is no longer valid image envato elementsby the numbers rbi crypto — over  increase in google search volumejust recently indian banks were refusing to service cryptorelated transactions citing a crypto banking ban imposed by the nation’s central bank back in  but the reserve bank of india — which has long been perceived as being anticrypto — unequivocally reminded banks this week that the nation’s highest court had struck down the crypto banking ban more than a year agothe notice from the rbi also said that banks may continue to take necessary action to ensure that transactions complied with regulatory guidelines such as knowyourcustomer antimoney laundering and combating of financing of terroristmthe indian parliament has yet to make a decision on proposed legislation that would virtually ban cryptocurrencies in the nation but finance minister nirmala sitharaman has hinted that india would not be shutting down crypto transactions and that it’s leaning towards regulationforkastinsights  what does it meanindia has a checkered history with cryptocurrency new delhi having oscillated between either banning or regulating virtual currencies such as bitcoin although the latest development in the indian cryptocurrency market is being celebrated it may be necessary to take a step back and examine what actually happened and perhaps put the champagne back on icejust after several major indian banks — including the state bank of india and hdfc bank — issued warnings to customers against using their services to trade cryptocurrency the rbi stepped in to clarify that financial institutions could not cite a legally defunct circular it had issued in  for such communicationsdid the rbi act because it’s now endorsing cryptocurrency trading no it did so because the circular in question — which prohibited india’s banks from providing services to crypto exchanges and businesses dealing with digital assets — was ruled invalid by the country’s supreme court in march the rbi has in fact not taken any position indicating that it recognizes the legality of cryptocurrency transactions in india in this instance it’s important to understand that when the supreme court threw out the crypto banking ban in  the opponent in the case was the central bank itself and that the rbi’s clarification to indian banks on may  may simply be a way of ensuring it avoids legal hazardif the central bank were to remain silent as sbi and hdfc bank leveraged an invalid circular it issued in  it could court renewed attention from the supreme court and perhaps spur further judicial action the rbi is merely safeguarding its position by issuing the clarification most likely on the advice of its legal counselso has the rbi given the green light to cryptocurrency in india not at all it is likely just protecting itself thailand’s sec tries to rein in defi with new rulesthailand’s securities watchdog is taking a shot at regulating defi image envato elementsby the numbers tuktuk finance — over

had an apr upwards of  as of press timeforkastinsights  what does it meanthe decentralized finance ecosystem has enjoyed a phenomenal rise over the past year building on the momentum of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum with the blockchain technology that supported them decentralizing the computing work needed to support their networks these blockchain networks have allowed users to transact on a peertopeer basis supporting smartcontract functionality that has eliminated the need for central intermediaries however the boom in cryptocurrency trading still requires centralized exchanges such as coinbase and binance which allow users to trade crypto using fiat onramps and as such these exchanges can be subject to regulation because fiat deposits and withdrawals require the use of credit cards and bank accountsglobal regulators are having a difficult time imposing legal frameworks and parameters on new forms of financial technology such as bitcoin and the exchanges that intermediate them but thailand’s sec is now attempting to confront defi — a sector that takes decentralization to an entirely new leveldefi services go beyond the work begun by cryptocurrencies decentralized exchanges are faceless protocols that leverage smart contracts to recreate traditional financial instruments and generate new ones they promise a dynamic disintermediating revolution in finance replacing exchanges marketmakers asset managers and financial institutions such as banks and lenders with software and because they employ decentralized permissionless blockchains as their settlement layer defi platforms are open to anyone anywhere who can gain access to cryptocurrenciesto the tech savvy crypto faithful defi represents new and innovative democratized access to financial products easier access to liquidity improved market efficiency and enhanced financial privacy but as seen far too often over the past year with defi the ecosystem can also be seriously risky for its usersa far too common occurrence in defi is the “rug pull” — a malicious tactic of bad actors in the crypto industry in which crypto developers abandon a project and simply run away with investors’ funds hidden in the anonymity of cyberspacethe reality is that when it comes to defi the ecosystem’s observers are split on regulation although many believe that regulation could greatly boost the industry others believe it simply cannot be put in place without crippling itin essence all financial regulation must assume the presence of intermediaries and regulatory frameworks are imposed on these intermediaries such as is currently occurring with crypto exchanges like coinbase and binance but the question remains for thailand’s sec how can it possibly find a way to regulate decentralized financial markets and related activities its route at least according to its statement appears to be pushing the task onto the traders who dabble in defi but thai regulators and policymakers may find defi carries them into uncharted waters that they may lack the means to navigate bitcoin transaction fees plummetbitcoin prices have been dropping markedly and so

this has allowed ethereum to continue to dominate most of the defi space and extend its lead in enterprise adoption however ethereum has also faced many hiccups and is currently hampered by an obvious lack of scalability and high network fees allowing rivals such as binance smart chain polkadot and solana to grab a piece of the actionadmirably cardano hasn’t been discouraged by the newcomers and

china’s future digital currency offer smartcontract capabilitya former people’s bank of china digital currency research lab director has hinted at interoperability and ethereum support for china’s cbdc image envato elementschina’s digital yuan — still commonly known by its original project name dcep digital currency electronic payment but now officially named ecny — should be equipped with a smart contract function according to yao qian formerly of the people’s bank of china yao made the remarks at the international financial forum a highlevel finance meeting in beijing on may yao a former director of the chinese central bank’s digital currency research lab which has been developing the ecny for the past seven years — said that digital currencies should not be a simple simulation of cash but needed to make full use of its “digital” characteristics and that ”the future of digital currency will definitely go to smart currency”yao also said he noticed that many system disasters had been caused by security breaches involving smart contracts indicating that the technology still required improvement he said that china’s e cny should start from a simple smart contract based on full considerations of security and that it should expand that function in the futureforkastinsights  what does it meanthe ecny was initially conceived as merely a digital version of the yuan but yao said in his speech that china’s central bank digital currency “will definitely” aim to incorporate smart contract functionalityyao who is now the director of the science and technology supervision bureau at the china securities regulatory commission was responding to comments made by us federal reserve chairman jerome powell on the digital yuan answering a reporter’s question on april  powell said the digital yuan’s real use was to allow “the  government to see every payment that’s used — for which it is used in real time”yao dismissed powell’s comments and said tracking realtime payments was “not the motivation for the chinese central bank’s digital currency experiment” he further explained that in china because most people already use thirdparty noncash payment methods such as alipay and wechat pay the central bank had already possessed the legal and technical capability to access all realtime transactions for some timeas yao understands it the ecny is set to adopt smartcontract functionality and will be able to leverage public blockchain networks such as ethereum and even facebookbacked diem formerly known as libra potentially fostering greater financial inclusionusing a twotier design china could use public blockchains to allow central banks to provide the digital yuan directly to users without requiring intermediaries“layered operations can enable the central bank’s digital currency to better benefit groups without bank accounts and achieve financial inclusion” yao said
