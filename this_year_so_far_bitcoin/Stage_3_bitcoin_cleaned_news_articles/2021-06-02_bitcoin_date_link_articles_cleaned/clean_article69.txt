from elon musk to snoop dog to gene simmons cryptocurrency has taken the world by storm but theres always a huge risk that accompanies digital currencies and should be factored in before and while investing a recent example is bitcoin the worlds oldest and largest crypto coins that plunged nearly  percent after the chinese governments crackdown on the trading of digital assets having said that there are still a large number of investors who find the idea of investing in cryptocurrencies enticing but are unable to take the step forward due to a lack of knowledgeand for them perhaps this post by a reddit user uteoeo may come in handy the user before listing  crucial factors claimed that they been involved in digital currency investments since  and therefore would like to share their two cents on how to go about it the user stressed on choosing coins using a valueinvesting approach here are the  factors enumerated in the post the user emphasised that it was important to consider only those digital currencies that looked like traditional businesses furthermore said would look at only those cryptos that have a discrete product or service they provide then said that while they were open to considering cryptos like siacoin storj filecoin decentralised storage golemiexec cloud computing theta video streaming power ledger wepower suncontract decentralised energy marketplace wouldnt invest in bitcoin nano or other such currencies once you have shortlisted a few potential cryptocurrencies to invest in its time you excluded those that didnt have a valueadded proposition due to decentralisation believe it or not not everything needs to be decentralised if i cant answer why decentralisation adds value then i throw out the coin the user wrote the third step involves finding if the digital currency has a working product or product in beta the user said this step is critical for anyone can say their product will do anything but the proof is in the pudding if they have a working product i test the product to see how it works the next big factor to be considered before making any investments in digital currency involves ensuring your potential cryptocurrency has a method to maintain funding to the developers of the product service even if the price of the coin goes down to clarify the user said that solid projects usually have nonprofit foundations with an ongoing revenue stream for developers this ensures the project will continue to mature grow even during a bear market next the user said it was important to prioritise finding how many coins were already in circulation the percentage of a currency controlled by a small number of people there are other red flags that can pop up so i suggest everyone spend some time reading about tokenomics generally assessing the market size is what was suggested next i always try to look at the current market size in the space that the coin is competing in for example for storj filecoin siacoin the decentralised storage market is projected to be around  billion by  the next step involves finding the traditional companies in the space and their market caps the user said it helps in making the decision moving forward the user suggested it was always a great idea to look at who the competitors in the cryptocurrency space are this may help you find a better investment and second of course its the competitors who will have some useful critical take on the coin chosen by you the user suggested going to the telegram reddit discord servers of the target coin and the competitors it is amazing how often i learn something unexpected and useful time we put all this together once you have collected all the information the user suggested you make a reasonable conservative judgement about what the coins current value is and what its potential value could be in terms of market cap i try to be conservative and only buy things that seem really undervalued luckily a lot of cryptos are very undervalued‚Äùbut before you go about making any investment in the volatile cryptocurrency market based on the information shared by this user in his reddit post and perhaps give popular virtual currencies like bitcoin and dogecoin a pass the user has another piece of advice for youi hope that some of you find this useful obviously these are just my thoughts so take them with a grain of salt
