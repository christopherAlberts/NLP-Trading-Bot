an experts point of view on a current eventukraine wants to be cryptocurrency centralimagine you’re a country with a soso economy exporting mostly metals and agricultural products but without a great deal of foreign investment how do you transform yourself into a hot destination for international money ukraine believes it has the answer it’s betting big on cryptocurrencies that could make the sorrowstricken country a global hotbed of cuttingedge financiers but the cryptocurrency moves could also spell troublea plant for mining bitcoin a process by which computing power is effectively exchanged for the cryptocurrency will soon rise near zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant not far from ukraine’s border with russia zaporizhzhia is europe’s largest nuclear power plant but the tobeconstructed cryptocurrency operation—signed by ukraine’s governmentowned nuclear plant operator energoatom and a private firm called  last year and involving a  million investment—is focused on power consumption not power generation it will draw on zaporizhzhia’s massive power output giving the ukrainian nuclear power industry—long associated with the chernobyl disaster—a chance at redemptionbeing located next to a massive nuclear plant is in fact ideal for the bitcoinmining plant and things get better another bitcoinmining plant is being built next to the rivne nuclear plant in western ukraine a threeway partnership between energoatom a regional authority and bitfury a dutch company that specializes in building bitcoin infrastructureso far ukraine already has around  companies in the cryptocurrency sectormoneywise the zaporizhzhya center may be poised for a bumpy ride the deal involves an investment firm called yom capital which is based in cyprus and has a minuscule corporate footprint yom and several related businesses are registered in malta according to the international consortium of investigative journalists’ offshore leaks database one south east trading ltd is located at a socalled letterbox address that hosts many firms and appears to have no business activityquestions about investors aside ukraine is betting big on cryptocurrencies in a document called virtual assets in ukraine the ministry of digital transformation lists how ukraine plans to make itself a top destination for the cryptocurrency world in addition to passing a new virtual assets law which had its first reading in the ukrainian parliament last december ukraine plans to actively attract cryptocurrency business through highly competitive tax rates companies will pay  percent of profits and don’t have to charge valueadded tax while individuals will pay  percent with a grace period until the end of  “we have a big talent pool and a strong blockchain developer community in ukraine” deputy minister of digital transformation alex bornyakov told me “they picked up the cryptocurrency trend faster than people in many other countries and figured out how to build businesses around it”so far ukraine already has around  companies in the cryptocurrency sector according to the government even without the legislation having been fully passed according to a new report by the cybersecurity firm hacken and the ukrainian venture capital and private equity association between july  and june   billion worth of cryptocurrency went out of ukraine while  billion worth arrived in the country the country’s average daily cryptocurrency transaction volume now corresponds to  million to  million“once we pass the legislation ukraine will become one of the world’s very top destinations for cryptocurrencies” bornyakov said “there are not that many countries that are cryptofriendly so companies go to the ones that are” when the legislation is in place he estimates ukraine could become home to around  cryptocurrency firmsthe datamining centers are meant to clinch the companies’ decisions to set up shop in ukraine because cryptocurrency collection is an oddly powerconsuming business mining cryptocurrencies devours astronomical amounts of energy that’s because these digital coins are mined—created—and traded using massive and massively complex digital ledgers known as blockchains a virtually unlimited number of highpowered computers can connect with these blockchainsas the financial times reported last month “the latest calculation from cambridge university’s bitcoin electricity consumption index suggests that bitcoin mining consumes  terawatt hours a year of electricity … that places it just above sweden at  of electricity usage in  and just below malaysia at ” this state of affairs has rattled even the early cryptocurrency adopter elon musk who recently announced that tesla will no longer accept bitcoin payments for its cars it is a remarkable turn of events considering that tesla owns an estimated  billion in bitcoin musk’s exit caused the cryptocurrency market to plunge by nearly  billionwith governments academics and even musk deciding that cryptocurrencies are simply too dangerous for the planet is structurally investing in them a good idea the swiss canton of zug thinks so as of this february people and businesses in the canton can pay taxes in cryptocurrencies the canton known by the moniker crypto valley has already made itself a hotbed of cryptocurrency business thanks to its cryptocurrencyfriendly rules as of last september the small canton—with a population of —was home to a remarkable  cryptocurrency firms “attracting cryptocurrency firms is a smart move by zug and ukraine” katarzyna ciupa a cryptocurrency researcher and phd candidate in finance and blockchain technology at the warsaw school of economics told me “crypto is the technology of the future and it’s here to stay”given zug’s status it is perhaps unsurprising that a local politician recently presented figures documenting the carbon footprint of the average bitcoin transaction it releases about the same amount of carbon dioxide as  visa transactions or the combined emissions of one us household over  days “sure being seen as crypto valley benefits zug’s image but you can’t care about the environment and promote bitcoins at the same time” that politician—social democrat jérôme peter—told me “people are saying bitcoins are getting cleaner but are they really and because the industry is so decentralized there’s no mr crypto who can decide they should get cleaner”cryptocurrencies add even more risk of dirty transactions than do secret bank accounts the fact that the transaction chain doesn’t need to include users’ real names has made virtual money criminals’ payment of choiceat least switzerland ranked third on transparency international’s corruption perception index where the first is the cleanest has experience with anonymous pecuniary matters cryptocurrencies though add even more risk of dirty transactions than do secret bank accounts while cryptocurrencies are legal the fact that the transaction chain doesn’t need to include users’ real names has made such virtual money criminals’ payment of choice the insurance broker marsh reports for example that in the first half of  average ransomware payments grew by  percent with a whopping  percent of payments made in bitcoinwhile most cryptocurrencies don’t have such formidable links to organized crime they operate in the shadow of the traditional economy—which invites abuse by those disinclined to obey the law “cryptocurrencies broadly understood are a fantastic opportunity for the global economy and one that’s much needed” ciupa said “but people are overusing it for example for money laundering every country is trying to cut abuse of cryptocurrencies but if we try to impose national and local restrictions on how to use cryptocurrencies cryptocurrency companies will just go elsewhere that’s why zug has so many of them and maybe soon ukraine too”cryptocurrencies’ shady side poses a challenge for ukraine which is ranked  on the  corruption perceptions index although ukrainians’ desire for corruption to be tackled once and for all propelled volodymyr zelensky to the presidency the country remains ensconced in the netherworld of the corruption index in  the year zelensky was elected it ranked only a few spots lower the international monetary fund also seems concerned about the lack of progress add to this a sector frequented by people who may not want their financial transactions monitored and you get a dangerous mix never mind the nuclear power plants “if you have a country that’s known to be corrupt if it allows cryptocurrencies to operate anonymously it can become attractive for money launderers” ciupa pointed out “if you can’t defeat corruption as it is how are you going to defeat it once you’ve added lots of cryptocurrency challenges”bornyakov who was a serial tech entrepreneur before becoming a minister is aware of the risks cryptocurrencies bring “they’re a technical innovation and technical innovations are often used by criminals” he said “but we have to consider the possibilities as well as the risks we totally understand that cryptocurrencies can be used by criminals but cash is used by criminals too”many of the cryptocurrency firms already active in ukraine are legitimate there are blockchain development companies that create the highly complex blockchains—transaction logs—through which cryptocurrencies travel there are also various fintech businesses and support firms all with silicon valleysounding names but there are also firms like the milton grouplast year the swedish daily dagens nyheter uncovered a massive scam run by the firm out of an office in kyiv from which workers sweettalked unsuspecting people around the world to invest in fake cryptocurrencies swedish prosecutors investigating the scam are trying to involve europol and other european counterparts in the case while swedish foreign minister ann linde has discussed it with the ukrainian government but to date there has been no trial let alone convictionsinterestingly the largest number of bitcoin owners are to be found in city councils the ministry of defense and the national policeukrainian civil servants for their part have enthusiastically embraced the new currencies according to government figures by the end of march this year ukrainian civil servants had declared

viacheslav dmytrovych a deputy in the dnipropetrovsk city council who owns some  million worth of the currency these are astounding amounts in a country where the average monthly income as of april this year is around  this is also a country that is hoping to receive  billion from the imf this yeartrying to propel itself from an agricultureexporting economy to a hightech one ukraine has made a daring bet but while cryptocurrencies are certainly here to stay trying to become their epicenter may be taking the bravery one step too far
