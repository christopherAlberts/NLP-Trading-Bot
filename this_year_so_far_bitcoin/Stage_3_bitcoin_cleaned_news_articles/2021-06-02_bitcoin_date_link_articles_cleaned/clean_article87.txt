the term market manipulation is often thrown around within the crypto space as the light trading volume means that many minor tokens can be easily moved around with relatively small ordersin larger markets it takes a lot more money to move the needle and they are less susceptible to manipulation except in some cases where market manipulation is actually celebratedone such asset is crude oil where the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec has been intentionally controlling output in order to push around the price for decades one such headline involving these countries and their allies known as opec can be seen today …by definition opec is a pricefixing cartel everyone knows that it’s a cartel and yet traders and the financial media as well as global regulators seem to go along with it anywayinstead of drawing criticism their successes are in many cases cheered by market participantsthis has always been a bit perplexing for me as i was under the impression that information that has the ability to move prices should generally be free and fairhowever in this case delegates from the opec member countries tend to hold closeddoor meetings to determine what the price should be and how they can collectively change itthey’re not always successful of course the invisible hand has a way of blowing them off when they get overly aggressive but still they’re successful often enough that the delegates themselves tend to have the upper hand against the home traderand some people wonder why we need decentralized marketsmanipulablethat said reading signs from the bitcoin network it does seem to be slightly more vulnerable to manipulationi’m not just talking about fud from the likes of elon musk and the chinese authorities it seems that during the recent shakeout bitcoin volumes especially on crypto exchanges have plummetedmessari’s real volume metric which hit a new alltime high of  billion during the may  drop is now reading just above  billion in the last  hourson the bitcoin blockchain itself we can also observe that the number of transactions per day has been trending downward since april and recently fell through the floor due to lack of excitementa transaction i sent yesterday went through in about two minutes flat and i’m glad i didn’t pay extra for quicker processingthat said it’s important to point out that even though the number of transactions is falling fast the amount of money flowing through the network doesn’t seem much affected at allnow i know that the big buyers tend to place their entry orders tightly under the price so as not to make their future purchases more expensivebut if a large buyer did want to send the price up with big market orders across different exchanges now would be a really good time…just sayinggetting technicalthe crypto market is decidedly down today in contrast with the stock marketsno particular reason for this comes to mind other than consolidation near the lows and “follow the leader” mentalitysure there are a few smallcap cryptocurrencies going up but that’s the nature of a market where shortterm leverage traders tend to chase the pumpsthe  moving average ma blue line may signify resistance for chartists but to me it screams cheaper than usual the  ma red line seems to confirm this from my end and i’m starting to get really bullish again
