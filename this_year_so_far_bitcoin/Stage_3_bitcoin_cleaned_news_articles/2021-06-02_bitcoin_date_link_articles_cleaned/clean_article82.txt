cryptocurrency has been having quite the year while the biggest names in crypto  bitcoin ethereum and dogecoin  have been gaining most of the attention there have been countless new cryptocurrencies popping up latelyone of the newest digital currencies is safemoon which launched in march of this year and has already gained more than  million buyersits also the fifthmostvisited page on coinmarketcap a pricetracking cryptocurrency website based on coinmarketcaps rankings safemoon is searched for more often than ethereum one of the hottest cryptocurrencies availablealthough safemoon has been making waves in the crypto world that alone doesnt necessarily make it a good investment heres what you need to know about the trendiest new cryptocurrencywhat is safemoonwith so many different cryptocurrencies available it can be tough to tell them apart there are a couple of things that differentiate safemoon from other digital currencies howeverfor one investors are charged a  fee if they choose to sell their tokens the purpose of this fee is to encourage investors to hold their tokens for the long term in theory that should reduce safemoons price volatility because there wont be as many day traders and shortterm investors buying and selling throughout the dayevery time an investor sells a safemoon token and pays the  fee a portion of that money is distributed to other safemoon investors and some of it is destroyed permanently so as more investors sell safemoon there are fewer tokens available overall safemoons creators believe that scarcity could increase the cryptos value similar to the way that bitcoins limited availability is said to make it more valuable over timeis safemoon actually safeall cryptocurrencies carry a certain amount of risk but safemoon is one of the riskiest in order for any cryptocurrency to survive over the long run it needs to have some sort of intrinsic valueright now safemoon doesnt serve any real purpose the vast majority of businesses dont accept cryptocurrency at all and safemoon is so new that its unlikely to gain traction anytime soon without any realworld utility it will be tough for safemoon to succeed over timesafemoon also uses the binance smart chain which is a key difference from decentralized ecosystems used by bitcoin and ethereum with decentralized crypto there is no central authority in other words its not controlled by any one company government or country binance is a centralized ecosystem and it has full control over its blockchain technology that means that it has the power to change anything about its system at any timethats not necessarily a bad thing but it does require safemoon investors to trust that binance will do whats in the cryptocurrencys best interest considering the fact that decentralization is one of the key advantages of crypto safemoons centralized system could be a disadvantagein addition security company certik performed an audit on safemoon and found a major vulnerability certik found that a significant portion of the seller fees go to a single account controlled by one of safemoons owners if that account is compromised in some way it could put safemoon investors at riskshould you invest right nowwhether you choose to invest in safemoon depends on your personal preferences and tolerance for risk if you have cash to spare and are willing to take a gamble you may be able to make a bit of money with this investment if youre lucky but safemoon is a very risky type of cryptocurrency and considering its lack of utility and its security issues there are plenty of better investments out there
