image  damaknow that the idea of going to parties again is becoming a possibility here in the sandalwoodscented year of  there are three kinds of people you should be terrified of being trapped in a conversation with me wildeyed qanon types and people really really into bitcoin or dogecoin or other cryptocurrencies for me i’m just going to talk about taillights until you cry from rage and boredom and qanon people are just going to try to get you to rescue the babies they think are trapped in public mailboxes but the crypto dudes oh man they’re never going to let up that’s why there’s a company daymak that’s planning on making an ev that mines bitcoin when parked ughadvertisementimage  damakcan you just imagine what a conversation with someone who pulls up in a hightech threewheeled ev that mines dogecoin would be like it’d be hell absolute hell you’ll want to chew off your own brainstem and if you think the person who would own something like this and not tell you about it so forcefully and unrelentingly you want to turn yourself into a singularity and blip out of existence then you’re delusionalimage  damakso as a warning here’s what these deadeyed bastards at daymak have planned for the daymak spiritus a threewheel ev that comes in two versions at each extreme end of the pricing spectrum a  one that goes  in  seconds and has a  mile range or a  one that goes  in  seconds and has a range of  milesas you likely guessed the differences are battery size  kw vs  kw and motor one vs threethe general look of the cars is about the same across that vast range and it is pretty cool looking a small twoseat little spaceshiplooking thing all wedges and flaps and intakes with a pair of lowset big round lightsadvertisementimage  damakthe car i actually think is pretty cool and i’ll be very curious to see if it makes it to market along with other stylish threewheel evs like the nobeadvertisementthe eyerolling bit is the cryptocurrency parteffective today daymak is accepting spiritus preorder payments in a multitude of cryptocurrencies including doge ethereum cardano and bitcoin making it one of the first lev manufacturers to do so every spiritus vehicle will be a node on the blockchain and will include daymak nebula miner and nebula wallet daymak nebula technology makes daymak spiritus the first car in history with mining hardware and cryptocurrency technology programmed into the user interface as an emissionfree daily driver with solar charging capabilities nebula infrastructure turns daymak’s spiritus vehicles into environmentallyfriendly crypto miner nodes which is an unprecedented milestone in the rapid evolution of blockchain technologiesadvertisementso daymak will have the necessary computational hardware to mine cryptocurrencies when parked and charging in some way either plugged into a charger trickle charger or they claim getting some charge from a roofmounted solar panelthe software that handles this is called daymak nebula and your car can mine crypto and somehow turn coal into electricity into data into money via whatever the hell these cryptomining things do and you somehow get this almostmoney and they have a “wallet” thing where they say you can use the money your car makes to pay tolls or charging fees or whateveradvertisementimage  damakall of this shit is so far removed from anything i’ve ever desired in a car that i don’t know what to think is it good maybe if you’re willing to believe a whole bunch of cryptorelated shit i guess soadvertisementis there something indefinably annoying and unsettling about every single bit of this absolutelyimage  damakadvertisementso far it seems these cars only exists as renders and ideas though a bodyless chassis mule appears to be real enough maybe they’ll actually have a car by  and maybe somehow using this car to mine cryptocurrencies will prove sensible and not cost more in electricity than you actually make solving all of those math problems to get a tiny fraction of a bit of madeup currency i know all currency is made up but i know lots more places that take madeup dollars than ethereum the value of which can be made or broken by some offhand bullshit elon musk decides to tweetdaymak sure seems to think this is a big deal this is from their press release“daymak is infusing cryptocurrency with the spiritus product offering from the ground up from the moment the customer orders the car all the way until it is driven to a destination that accepts cryptocurrency payments spiritus and crypto will go handinhand “we are also working with a variety of exchanges to offer leasing payments via crypto this is yet another aspect of crypto integration in which the daymak spiritus is pioneering” elaborated baiocchi “in addition to all the other exciting tech in the car like the daymak ondata wireless charger and the ionix ai battery system the daymak nebula platform is yet another technology breakthrough that makes the spiritus one of the most advanced cars in history this technology will be available for licensing to other electric vehicle manufacturers as well”advertisementhonestly i’m not sure i’ve ever desired a new automotive innovation less so you know way to go daymak
