cryptocurrencies have been considered a niche investment since their conception in  even after the crazy bull run of  when people were trying to buy bitcoins at the very top big players never took them seriously the institutional line of thought on cryptocurrencies was that they are just speculative assets without any substantial valuehowever since last year things have changed quite drastically the coronavirus economic crisis showed us how fragile our current monetary system really is this pushed both retail and institutional investors to turn towards bitcoin as a sound store of value to hedge against the upcoming hyperinflationas such bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies are now considered to be useful financial tools for everyone and not for just diehard fans supporting the technology behind themin this article we will lay out the effects the bitcoin revolution has had on economic development and the financial world as a whole to this end we need to explore some of the main benefits of blockchain technology and some of its macro and micro applications that lead to a more efficient financial ecosystemintroduction to blockchain and bitcoinbitcoin was created in  by the mysterious satoshi nakamoto the goal of the original cryptocurrency was to become a digital peertopeer payment network accessible to all and without the need for any intermediariesbitcoin was the first global currency that wasn’t issued by any central bank or government instead it relies upon a mathematical process called mining where millions of computers participate in a decentralized network to provide the needed power to mint new coinsthis decentralization was made possible through a distributed ledger technology called the blockchain bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies do not exist in any physical shape or form instead they are just transaction data recorded on the public ledger which makes them virtually impossible to duplicate or falsifythese transactions are organized in blocks of data and chained together through cryptography  hence the name blockchainthe main characteristics and benefits of bitcointhe decentralized nature of blockchain has brought a wide array of benefits to mankind in various sectors however finances were disrupted the most thanks to some of the inherent properties of bitcoin and the advantages they bring includingcapped maximum supplyunlike traditional currencies there is actually a limit to how many bitcoin can come into circulation this maximum supply is fixed to  million bitcoins with  million coins already circulating on the marketsas such bitcoin ensures increased scarcity over time this is in contrast to fiat money that can be printed whenever governments see fit just recently governments responded to the  crisis by printing trillions of dollars and injecting them into the current financial systemthis diluted the value of money already in the hands of the people or in their savings accounts bitcoin prevents this due to its deflationary design as fewer coins can be created over time thanks to the reward halving mechanismthe increased scarcity has played a crucial role in the price of bitcoin which has increased exponentially since its releaseglobal financial inclusionthanks to their decentralized nature blockchains are permissionless networks where anyone with internet access can take partthis way people in regions with poor banking systems and prone to hyperinflation can still access the growing internet economyfurthermore the decentralized finance ecosystem provides advanced financial products to anyone across the globe as such thirdworld country investors can access lending staking and interest accounts thanks to blockchain technologycheap and fast remittanceinternational money transfers are extremely slow especially if we consider that they are mere pieces of data traveling across the internet even so a money transfer from one country to another can take as long as  days with multiple intermediaries charging commissions in betweenblockchain technology solves this issue by allowing fast and costeffective international remittance transactions are done peertopeer avoiding any kind of thirdparty cost at the same time a bitcoin transfer takes only a few minutes compared to hours or days needed for a swift transferflexible store of valuefinally one of the most crucial benefits of bitcoin is its flexibility compared to traditional storeofvalue commodities bitcoin is infinitely easier to transport store and send overseas in contrast to gold which is bulky and heavythis advantage has been widely appreciated during the lockdowns caused by the pandemic people could easily transfer bitcoin to each other and convert it into usable assets unlike precious metals or bonds for instanceconclusionsince its inception bitcoin has managed to jumpstart an entire industry thanks to the numerous benefits of the blockchain technology it’s built uponthe success of cryptocurrencies is undeniable we are bound to see them play a crucial role in the shaping of the global economy in the upcoming years
