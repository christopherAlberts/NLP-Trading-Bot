even by the standards of cryptocurrencies the past seven days have been a wild ride the price of bitcoin crashed  per cent on wednesday to  – less than half the peak reached last month – after china announced a new crackdown and elon musk announced tesla would not accept bitcoin as paymenttraders sold off almost every major coin turning exchanges into a sea of red a rapid rebound later in the week wasn’t enough to recoup the losses by monday bitcoin was back up to concerningly the main crypto exchanges weren’t able to cope with the selloff experiencing technical outages which left customers temporarily unable to tradefor critics these problems give a taste of more serious issues that might occur in the event of a deeper downturn problems which would have ramifications far beyond cryptolandfrances coppola a financial economist who has written extensively about cryptocurrencies believes exchanges could struggle to cope with demand for withdrawals if enough people rush for the door and want to swap their crypto for traditional or fiat money“it would look very like a traditional bank run” says coppola“if the exchanges didn’t have enough fiat currency to meet withdrawal requests they would either have to obtain more in a hurry through a fire sale of assets or refuse to allow people to draw down fiat currencies”in practice this would mean shutting down their apps which coppola points out might look to a customer like a technical outageat the heart of potential problems in the  market are stablecoins a vitally important component of the crypto world which act as a bridge to the traditional financial systemstablecoins are socalled because they are pegged to the value of a realworld asset typically a currency like the dollarthey alleviate the biggest problem faced by cryptocurrencies huge volatility it can be nervewracking to go to bed while leaving your savings in an asset like bitcoin that’s fallen  per cent by lunchtime then risen by almost as much by the time you sit down for dinnerhaving a coin anchored to the price of the dollar pound or euro which are in turn backed by central banks means that people can “cash out” of the crypto market when it gets too choppythe availability of stablecoins has been a key factor in driving the recent bull run that saw bitcoin’s price surge  per cent between september and april but critics argue that the stability they claim to offer is a dangerous illusionwhy crucially when someone swaps their volatile cryptocurrency for a stablecoin such as tether by far the most widely used they are still within the crypto ecosystem they have not withdrawn real funds into a bank accounta digital analogue of a dollar is not a dollar tether dollars “usdt” can’t be used in many places outside of a crypto exchange its dollars are not backed by the us federal reserve but by an opaque company registered in hong kong with a bank account in the bahamas that has been less than transparent about its financial positiontether derives its value largely from the promise that it can be swapped for real dollars at a  exchange rate that promise has looked increasingly shaky jpmorgan is among those to have warned that a crash in the value of tether could sink the whole bitcoin market“exchanges market tether as a usd equivalent” coppola says “but there’s no guarantee from exchanges that people will always be able to exchange their tethers for usd and more importantly withdraw those dollars from the exchange”“and there’s also no guarantee from tether that people will be able to exchange their tethers for usd”tether the company behind the coin of the same name disagrees that it faces a problem it says that whatever price tether may be trading at on exchanges the company will honour the  peg with the dollarthe company is facing increased scrutiny however because until recently it had claimed that for every digital dollar it created it kept a real one in reserve at the bankthen in  it admitted this wasn’t true it only had enough to cover  per cent of its coins and not all of that amount was held in actual cash in the bank most of it was held in various forms of debt tether has refused repeated calls to audit its reserves so no one can verify its claims but the net is closing inin february tether agreed to pay  as part of a settlement with the new york attorney general after a  investigation which concluded “tether’s claims that it was at all times backed by dollars was a lie”tether was ordered to file quarterly disclosures stating what assets it is holding in reserve the first of those disclosures was published earlier this month in the form of a onepage document with two pie charts and no explanationin order to ensure that it can meet its promise to redeem a tether for a dollar the company needs to hold lots of dollars and high quality assets that can be sold quickly in exchange for dollars should the need arise but the company said only  per cent of its reserves are in cash with the rest held in various forms of debt issued by unknown entitiestether is acting in some ways like a bank creating money out of nothing however for good reason banks are highly regulated and must keep a reasonable cushion of capital assets minus liabilities to absorb potential lossestether is not regulated and its capital is a fraction of the amount that banks maintain at the end of march its capital ratio was just  per cent according to the best that can be deduced from the figures it has publishedfor anyone who can remember the global financial crisis some of these points – an institution with a dangerously low amount of capital risky debt labelled as safe – may sound familiarmeanwhile tether is growing at phenomenal pace in january last year it had issued  in tethers now more than  are in circulationwhile a collapse of stablecoins like tether could have dire consequences for the whole crypto market a fullblown economic meltdown similar to  is not likely says coppola“nevertheless an awful lot of people stand to get badly burned if it crashes”just like banks stablecoins are vulnerable to a run if people lose faith in their solvency and rush for the exitduring the rapid bitcoin selloff this week tether dollars were briefly changing hands for around  that price could easily fall further if people’s confidence in the company behind it deterioratesa spokesperson for the company said the peg to the dollar was not under threat“last week tether performed extremely well under challenging conditions for many” tether said “subject to our terms of service tether issues and redeems one usdt for one dollar no more no less this is irrespective of market conditions“as the pioneer of the stablecoin model tether represents battletested technology that has been through many cycles many users were flooding into usdt as a safe harbour”the allure of the cryptocurrency revolution has been that it is decentralised and therefore not reliant on powerful unaccountable institutions by becoming reliant on stable coins it has arguably created exactly what it set out to overthrow
