up until now businesses that accept bitcoin payments have had a free ride compared to businesses that accept cash if tesla sold a car and the customer paid with bitcoin tesla didn’t have to fill in any special government forms but an auto dealer who sold a car for cash had to notify the governmentthat’s about to change as part of its american families plan the biden administration just announced that any business that accepts cryptocurrency as payment for goods and services will have to report purchases over  to the internal revenue service irsjp koning a coindesk columnist worked as an equity researcher at a canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large canadian bank he runs the popular moneyness blogthis obligation has been required for cash transactions going back to the  for instance if a real estate broker sells a property for over  and the buyer pays in cash the broker has to submit a form  to the government the form includes the buyer’s name address taxpayer id number and other detailssubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policythe form  requirement applies to car dealers jewelry stores boat dealers pawn brokers and any other cashintensive businessthe information gleaned from these form  gets collected in a database by the financial crimes enforcement network fincen the us’ antimoney laundering authority and used along with currency transaction report ctr and suspicious activity report sars to help catch money launderers and because the form includes a taxpayer id number the irs can crossreference it against a taxpayer’s stated income to catch tax evaderswe don’t know yet if bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions will be subject to the exact same form  reporting as cash but it’s likely that the biden plan envisions something along those linesi suspect tesla’s recent foray into accepting cryptocurrency may have helped spur the biden administration’s  reporting requirement recall that on march  tesla ceo elon musk announced on twitter tesla would allow customers to buy cars with bitcoin this offer has since been rescindedif you work through the implications of businesses accepting large bitcoin payments you can see why the government might have been concerned by tesla’s moveregular lawabiding folks were never going to buy their tesla with bitcoin the company’s punitive return policy for cars bought with bitcoin ensured that compounding matters is the fear factor involved in making nonreversible bitcoin payments bankmediated payment methods are a lot friendlier most importantly bitcoiners hold bitcoin because they are expecting to get rich offloading bitcoins to buy a tesla means not becoming a millionaireif there was one group of buyers who may have flocked to buy teslas with bitcoin it was people willing to put up with all these inconveniences motivated folks like money launderers and tax evaderswouldbe money launderers have strong motives for using businesses that accept bitcoin as a “money mules” the irs has become more active about gathering personal trading data from cryptocurrency exchanges and so bitcoin owners with large gains and a preference for avoiding taxes must find lightlysurveilled offramps to liquidate their holdingsif you work through the implications of businesses accepting large bitcoin payments you can see why the government might have been concerned by tesla’s moveat the same time antimoney laundering aml measures at cryptocurrency exchanges are improving which means it is getting tougher for anyone who earned their bitcoin illicitly to launder them that waytesla’s decision to accept bitcoin may have made it the target of these highrisk clients to convert illicit bitcoin into legitimate dollars buy  teslas with bitcoin accept delivery then resell the cars for dollars in a bank account voila tesla has unwittingly helped launder dirty moneymoney laundering doesn’t scale well with smallticket items say buying pizzas or tshirts but cars are a particularly convenient way to launder money reselling  new teslas is much easier than selling  tshirtsin its nowdeleted bitcoin policy tesla said it would be conducting due diligence on buyers “you authorize us to make inquiries whether directly or through third parties that we consider necessary to verify your identity or protect you andor us against fraud or other financial crime”but a wouldbe launderer may not have taken tesla’s threat very seriously what does a car manufacturer know about setting up aml controlstesla removed its bitcoin payments option last week elon musk cited concern about “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions” incongruently musk hasn’t sold tesla’s bitcoin investment but it’s also possible that the risks of attracting every money launderer and tax evader in america led tesla execs to advocate for closing down the bitcoin payments windowof course i’m just speculating about their motivations but the key point remains accepting large bitcoin payments can be risky for a companyback to the biden administration’s proposed  reporting requirement for purchases consummated with cryptocurrency if it requires something like a form  it will add an extra layer of paperwork for companies like tesla that want to accept bitcoinbut it may also make bitcoin acceptance easier if companies have balked up until now at the idea of accepting bitcoin payments because of the risk of attracting shady customers the  reporting requirement provides a governmentsanctioned way of doing so a company need only be sure to fill in an irs form for each purchase and they’ll be onside so a form  requirement for cryptocurrency might make tesla more willing to restart bitcoin payments not lessif more and more businesses decide to accept large cryptocurrency payments will bitcoin finally become a popular medium of exchangeperhaps not this gets us back to the original problem regular people were never going to buy teslas with bitcoin for the reasons listed above and now with a proposed  cryptocurrency reporting requirement on the way money launderers and tax evaders won’t bother buying cars either
