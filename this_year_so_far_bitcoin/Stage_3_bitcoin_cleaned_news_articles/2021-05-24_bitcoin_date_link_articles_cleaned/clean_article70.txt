a new study has found that iran now accounts for  per cent of the world’s bitcoin mining and that the country is using the technology to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency assets to circumnavigate crippling sanctions imposed by the us and other countrieswashington has subjected tehran to economic penalties since the iranian revolution of  in opposition to its nuclear programme and its support for groups in the middle east that the us considers to be terrorist organisationsin their current form the sanctions amount to a neartotal economic embargo and a ban on all imports most damagingly from the country’s oil banking and shipping industries which has caused the former to plummet by  per cent in a decade and inspired recession unemployment and periodic outbreaks of civil unrest follow all the latest updates with the independent’s live coverage of the crypto marketbut the new research from blockchain analytics firm elliptic suggests that the country has turned to crypto mining as a new lifeline and a means of commodifying its energy potential which is considerable and relatively inexpensive given that iran is the world’s biggest producer of natural gassince  the country has recognised bitcoin mining as a lucrative business practice and swiftly established a licensing system requiring miners to pay a higher tariff for their electricity use and to sell their mined bitcoins on to the central bankbitcoin farms have since popped up across the country including in mosques where electricity is free allowing iran to in effect indirectly sell its energy assets on global markets and therein bypass trade embargoesthe bitcoins earned can also be used to pay for imports allowing miners to sidestep restrictions on carrying out transactions with iranian bankswhile the exact extent of bitcoin mining in iran is difficult to measure elliptic says its  per cent figure is based on data collected from miners by the cambridge centre for alternative finance up to april  as well as statements from iran’s statecontrolled power generation company in january  indicating that up to  mw of electricity was being consumed by the sectorthe electricity being used by the miners would require the equivalent of around  million barrels of crude oil each year to generate – approximately  per cent of total iranian oil exports last yearwhile iran’s crypto mining operations might currently be worth around  in annualised revenues they are also placing a major strain on the country’s creaking energy infrastructure networkto address that several chinese firms like rhy and lubian have reportedly stepped in with fresh investment and established farms of their own in the rafsanjan special economic zone in the country’s south east“we have good local resources in iran and we have maintained good relations with the ministry of energy the ministry of foreign affairs and even the army in iran” the latter said in a statement to “financial institutions should consider the sanctions risk they are exposed to due to iranian bitcoin mining  particularly those that are beginning to offer cryptoasset services” said dr tom robinson elliptic’s cofounder and chief scientist“if  per cent of bitcoin mining is based in iran then there is a  per cent chance that any bitcoin transaction will involve the sender paying a transaction fee to a bitcoin miner in iran”
