at the launch of bitcoin in  the size of the potential of the underlying technology the blockchain was not fully appreciatedwhat has not been fully exploited is the unique features of blockchain technology that can improve the lives of people and businesses these include the fact that it is an opensource software this makes its source code legally and freely available to endusers who can use it to create new products and services another significant feature is that it is decentralized democratizing the operation of the services built on it control of the services built on a blockchain isn’t in the hands of an individual or a single entity but involves all those connected to the networkin addition it enables peertopeer interaction between those connected to the network this is key as it enables parties to transact directly without using intermediaries or third parties finally it has inbuilt security data stored on it is immutable and cannot be changed easily new data can be added only after it is verified by everyone in the networkunfortunately bitcoin the project that introduced blockchain technology has hogged the limelight diverting attention from the technology’s underlying potential benefitsbitcoin has been embroiled in massive controversies attracting a host of criticisms these include the fact that it’s speculative and volatile and that it doesn’t provide any utility its price is driven largely by what investors think of it rather than any intrinsic value this is unlike other asset classes from which value can be derived such as gold jewelry real estate rent stocks and bonds interestthere is also an argument that it is bad for the environment because it uses so much electricityin addition developments and projects in the cryptoassets space since the launch of bitcoin have been largely driven by commercial interest and investment returns little attention has been given to its potential to contribute to the social and economic welfare of peoplebut this is slowly changingblockchain’s potential in africaa few companies have begun showcasing blockchain capabilities to various african countries unlike most other cryptocurrency blockchains which focus on private sector use in developed regions like europe and north america their approach has been to target the governments and public institutions in the developing worldin april the ethiopian government confirmed that it had signed a deal to create a national database of student and teacher ids using a decentralized digital identity solution the deal involves providing ids for  million students across  schools which will be used to store educational recordsthis is the largest blockchain deal ever to be signed by a government and has been making waves in the cryptoasset industryi believe that the deal marks a watershed moment for the use of blockchain and the cryptoasset industry and for african economies because it offers the promise of blockchain being used for real socioeconomic change the deal means that blockchain technology will be used to provide digital identity to millions of ethiopians digital identity—missing in most african countries—is the first step to real financial inclusion which in turn has been shown to carry a host of benefitswhat makes this promising is that it is the first main blockchain project focused on serving the african market with goals that align with developmental agendas set out under the united nations sustainable development goals as well as the african union agenda  goalsthe playersthere are three companies behind the dealthe first is cardano which has been at the forefront of showing how its core technology can be used to the benefit of governments cardano is technically owned by the cardano foundation a swiss nonprofit organizationcardano commissioned the software company iohk and a japanese software company emurgo to develop and maintain the cardano blockchaincardano isn’t alone in trying to power the future of finance by establishing a financial system characterized by peertopeer transactions ethereum the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after bitcoin is also pursuing this pathboth projects have a shared history as their ceos vitalik buterin and charles hoskinson were founders of ethereum but went their separate ways due to a business disagreementcardano iohk and emurgo have been showcasing how cardano blockchain and its core technology can be used to the benefit of african countriesin the case of the ethiopian deal a decentralized digital identity solution atala prism is being used the project will build digital identity solutions on the cardano blockchain the idea is to start by granting primary secondary and university students a digital identity that can track their educational career and future progressbitcoinsince the launch of bitcoin the cryptoasset industry has had an eventful history with dramatic episodesthe exponential rise and drastic fall in the price of bitcoin particularly from  has also added to concerns about itthen there was the proposed launch of private global stablecoins such as proposed by facebook libra now called diem and fierce opposition of western governments for their fear of potential loss of monetary sovereignty this resulted in a drive led by china to launch central bank digital currencies many countries are now exploring this optionmore intriguing has been the growth in a decentralized finance industry a fullblown financial system now appears to be running in the form of noncustodial finance as transactions happen on a peertopeer basis rather than through financial intermediaries like banksbut claims that a cryptocurrency could deliver financial inclusion since it facilitates the peertopeer exchange of value have not been met this is because currencies like bitcoin are far less accessible to those who need financial inclusion the most—such as those located in very poor and economically disadvantaged countriesthe bitcoin network is not managed by any corporate entity because of its decentralized open source network and therefore doesn’t have a profit driven mission nevertheless the cryptocurrency is now mostly desirable for its ability to make people richthe futuregiven the increasing doubts and concerns about the bitcoin network surely the right approach would be to shift focus away from it and instead to put energy into blockchain projects promising real contributions to the worldit is clear that new technologies such as blockchains hold huge promises to help achieve inclusive growth in economies such as those in africa they could be used for example in facilitating the continent’s free trade agreement through the institution of regional digital currencies powered by blockchain these could promote intraregional trade and could indeed be the answer to the currency inconvertibility problems—the inability to exchange one african currency for another—which has long plagued trade in the regionthe ethiopian deal should be one that african governments monitor closelythis article is republished from the conversation under a creative commons license read the original articlesign up
