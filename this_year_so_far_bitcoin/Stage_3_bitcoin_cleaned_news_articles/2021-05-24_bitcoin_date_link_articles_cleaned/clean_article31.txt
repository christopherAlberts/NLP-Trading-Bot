wild swings in the value of cryptocurrencies have once again raised questions about the fundamental role and function of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin is bitcoin a digital currency that represents the future of money is it a form of digital gold — a stable store of value and an inflation hedge or is bitcoin a purely speculative asset that is prone to massive price swingsto tackle these questions one must first grasp the unique status and role of money in modern economies in the dystopian novel “the mandibles a family ” by lionel shriver a character an economics professor at georgetown university observes “money is emotional because all value is subjective money is worth what people feel it’s worth they accept it in exchange for goods and services because they have faith in it economics is closer to religion than science without millions of individual citizens believing in a currency money is colored paper”in her novel shriver imagines a scary scenario in which people lose confidence in the us dollar and its value crashes the dollar loses its global reserve currency status and the resulting crisis precipitates a default by the us government on its debt obligationsadvertisementmany technolibertarians influenced by fears of a realworld collapse in the value of fiat currencies as well as by a desire to establish a decentralized payment system that would end government’s supposed monopoly over money creation became early adopters of bitcoin and continue to be major advocates for the increased use of cryptocurrenciesthe problem with fictional scenarios like the one painted in shriver’s novel as well as with the widespread belief that modern fiat money is purely based on a shared illusion is that they ignore a key aspect of reality involving key fiat currencies major fiat currencies in fact have some derived “intrinsic value” due to their status as legal tenders — they are backed by the full faith and power of stable national governments and supported by an elaborate and sophisticated regulatory and financial systemin her congressional testimony legal scholar katharina pistor noted “states that have their own currency issue most of their debt in their own currency and under their own laws and oversee financial intermediaries that also issue most of their debt in the currency of their home regulator states ensure asset safety by putting the future productivity of their economies and taxpaying citizens on the line they insure bank deposits up to a ceiling and they stand in for the sovereign debt they have issued”it would therefore require a state to utterly fail in some fiscal fashion as was the case in venezuela and zimbabwe in recent years for citizens to abandon faith in their currencymeanwhile bitcoin has no intrinsic value and its supply is inelastic it is not recognized as legal tender by major governments and no central bank will provide a backstop to cryptocurrencyoriented institutions furthermore cryptocurrencies are unlikely to play the role of a widely accepted medium of exchange or act as a unit of account given their tremendous daytoday volatility the fact that significant market turbulence can be generated by random tweets from a celebrity entrepreneur highlights the inaptness of using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for undertaking daytoday transactionsadvertisementcostly and energyintensive mining and transaction verification processes also reduce the attractiveness of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin furthermore bitcoin’s popularity among those involved in illegal activities will generate regulatory scrutiny and negate its anonymity advantage looking ahead statesupported central bank digital currencies are more likely to become the future of moneyif not the future of money can we make a case for bitcoin as digital gold proponents argue that since bitcoin by design is limited to a maximum of  million units it can act as a stable store of value given its short history and its intangible nature it is unclear that bitcoin offers a true alternative to traditional gold gold has a long history as a medium of exchange and the yellow metal has impressive physical properties that have caused humans to value it highly for thousands of years even today many societies widely use gold for jewelry and ceremonial purposes additionally from a financial standpoint bitcoin is currently too correlated with risky assets to act as an effective inflation hedgeat present bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appear to primarily function as speculative assets whose fluctuating valuations may be driven by financial mania or a form of contagious narrative central bank liquidity injections massive fiscal transfers rise of a new generation of retail investors utilizing online platforms like reddit to coordinate their actions and the emergence of zerocommission online trading platforms like robinhood have created a speculative frenzyfrankly nobody really knows the fundamental value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as we have yet to settle the debate surrounding their primary utility and functionproselytizers and critics continue to debate various use case scenarios for popular cryptocurrencies even as volatile cryptocurrencies grab the headlines we may be failing to grasp that a genuinely transformative era involving new financial technology and innovations may soon be upon us blockchainbased smart contracts nonfungible tokens and a shift towards decentralized finance all have the potential to radically alter the financial system such developments deserve greater attention from the media as well as from longterm investors and policymakersvivekanand jayakumar is an associate professor of economics at
