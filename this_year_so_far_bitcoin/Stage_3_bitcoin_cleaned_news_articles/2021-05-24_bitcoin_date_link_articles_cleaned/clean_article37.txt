cryptocurrencies can be used to hide your spouses’ true worth“as cryptocurrencies become more established they will undoubtedly enter mainstream divorce proceedings”cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin

there a reason to even stay”harriet errington a lawyer for boodle hatfield believes that bitcoin divorces are “going to become a massive issue” and fears that courts used to traditional ways of unearthing hidden wealth could be illequipped “the family court is quite old fashioned i suppose imagine a fuddy duddy judge faced with one of these issues  could be worth hardly anything or could be worth a fortune depending on the date of valuation” she says“ more and more people are going to buy into it it’s such an obvious way for people who want to hide money from their partner to do that divorce is the biggest threat to anyone’s wealth” obscuring wealth in digital coins is less popular in cases of largescale asset hiding vardag adds for the ultrarich with serious amounts of money to

cryptocurrencies stabilised leading to individuals investing larger proportions of their wealth in these assets we would expect then to see this filter through to other aspects of life including divorce proceedings”but a technologically savvy spouse could hide cryptocurrency easily during a divorce battle argues texasbased divorce lawyer kelly burris“i have not seen any attorneys other than myself request information regarding cryptocurrency in a divorce action and the rule often tends to be if the other side doesn’t ask you may not have a duty to disclose” she sayssuspicious partners should avoid turning detective however “it can be tempting to hack into emails or rifle through filing cabinets but there are strong penalties for doing that” warns errington “it’s hard as it’s tempting to open people’s mail or hack into their emails and do some detective work but that’s not sanctioned by the court”as bitcoin is used increasingly as a strategy to conceal wealth lawyers will
