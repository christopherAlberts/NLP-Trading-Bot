for more than  years the stock market has been one of the greatest wealth creators in this country stocks might have taken a back seat to housing oil gold or other assets for brief periods of time over the past century but theyve delivered the highest consistent returns of any investment vehiclethat is until cryptocurrencies came along a little over a decade agothe emergence of bitcoin cryptobtc ethereum cryptoeth dogecoin cryptodoge and a host of other digital currencies have paved the way for onceinalifetime gains for instance a  investment in bitcoin at  would have been worth over  million when it hit  a token in midaprilbut over the past two weeks cryptocurrencies have fallen off a cliff some would call this a natural pullback after a monstrous run higher i have a different name for it a popping bubblewhile there is no shortage of enthusiasts who believe digital currencies are the greatest thing since sliced bread i believe the crypto market is imploding for  very good reasons theres very minimal realworld utilityone of the biggest drawbacks of digital currency is that its virtually useless outside a cryptocurrency exchange although weve seen a small number of highprofile companies or organizations accept bitcoin or dogecoin the reality is that the total number of businesses accepting either is microscopic approximately  businesses globally have chosen to accept dogecoin after eight years while fundera found that  businesses accept bitcoin as of december  for some context here there are an estimated  million entrepreneurs worldwide valuations relative to transaction data made no senseeven though valuation is somewhat subjective one glance at transaction data for the three most popular cryptocurrencies relative to payment processing juggernauts such as visa nysev and mastercard nysema would leave anyones jaw on the floorthe latest nilson report found that  billion credit transactions were processed daily in   million of which were handled by visa and mastercard by comparison bitcoin ethereum and dogecoin are processing in the neighborhood of   million and  respective transactions on their blockchains each day all the major cryptos combined cant hold a candle to the processing potential of visa or mastercard yet the big three of crypto have a higher combined market value than visa and mastercard that makes no sense businesses have been slow to adopt blockchainon paper blockchain sounds great on the financial side of the equation its a way to expedite the validation and settlement of payments rather than waiting up to a week for crossborder payments to settle they could be resolved in mere seconds or minutes blockchain also has nonfinancial applications ethereums smart contractdriven blockchain might be the key to one day unlocking supply chain bottleneckshowever what sounds great on paper doesnt always translate into realworld success blockchain continues to suffer from a  businesses wont adopt it till the technology is proven on a broad scale but no businesses will abandon their existing and proven infrastructure to effectively be the guinea pig until blockchain matures big business will keep its distance theres virtually no barrier to entryaside from minimal utility my biggest personal gripe with crypto is theres no barrier to entry anyone with the time to code can develop a blockchain and potentially a tethered token according to coinmarketcap there are almost  different cryptocurrencies in its system while many arent trading much if at all thats an insane number of potential competitors to bitcoin dogecoin and ethereum with the likelihood of many more to comein short the crypto space is constantly being diluted by an unlimited amount of competition centralization remains a problemone of the many goals of cryptocurrencies is decentralization this is to ensure that no one person or small group of people controls a network yet according to data from bitinfochartscom ownership in bitcoin and dogecoin is fairly centralized just  addresses own almost  of all bitcoin while  of all outstanding dogecoin is owned by only  addresses its possible folks are waking up to the fact that these financial experiments arent as decentralized as they were intended to be elon musk is tugging at heartstringsanother reason the crypto bubble is bursting is that its been artificially driven by tweets from tesla ceo elon muskat first musk was all aboard the bitcoin train he purchased  billion bitcoin for teslas balance sheet in february and announced that the company would begin accepting bitcoin for electric vehicle purchases a month later then after  days he tweeted that tesla would no longer accept bitcoin because of the adverse environmental impacts of mining it hes since turned his attention to dogecointhe fact that tweets with little or no substance are creating and erasing hundreds of billions of dollars in crypto market value would seem to indicate that a bubble has been brewing for some time not all governments are ok with cryptothe crypto bubble is also popping because some governments arent ok with allowing cryptocurrencies to undermine their own central bankbacked currencies last week china sent the crypto market into a tailspin after prohibiting banks and online payment channels in the country from offering any services related to the cryptocurrency industry it should be noted that a lot of bitcoin mining occurs in chinaand chinas far from alone turkey recently enacted a ban on crypto payments meanwhile countries including bolivia ecuador nigeria and algeria have effectively banned digital currencies this trend makes the global use case for crypto unlikely there are no identifiable realworld correlationsyet another issue with crypto is there are no readily identifiable realworld correlationsfor example we know that gold and the us dollar have an inverse relationship to one another when the dollar is declining in value gold is very likely rising in value this is a correlation thats been established over a long period of timebitcoin ethereum and dogecoin dont have these correlations enthusiasts like to point out how crypto is a hedge against inflation but they forget that bitcoin has both risen and fallen when the money supply expanded rapidly or slowly crypto is driven by emotion and technical analysis primarily because it has no realworld correlations leverage is haunting the crypto marketthe cryptocurrency implosion can also be blamed on investors who are overlevered some of the most popular crypto exchanges will allow customers to use  to  times leverage on their actual account equity while this isnt an uncommon amount of leverage in forex where currencies move in fractions of a cent its absolutely ludicrous for crypto which can move  in the blink of an eyeaccording to data from bybtcom via bloomberg over  accounts totaling  billion in aggregate crypto assets were liquidated as a result of leveragebased margin calls on may  because of this insane leverage it doesnt take much for things to go south quickly for the crypto market investors always overhype new techfinally investors frequently overestimate the adoption of new technology though there is no shortage of people hyped up about blockchain its been more than a halfdecade and the blockchain buzz hasnt materialized into meaningful enterprise usage it takes all nextbigthing technology time to mature and crypto will be no different
