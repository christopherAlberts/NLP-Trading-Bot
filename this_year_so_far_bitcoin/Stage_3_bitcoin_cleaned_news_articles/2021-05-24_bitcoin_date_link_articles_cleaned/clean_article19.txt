myles udland brian sozzi and julie hyman discuss the continued selloff of bitcoin as the cryptocurrency falls below  due to factors such as china and the us treasury making moves to tighten regulationsvideo transcriptmyles udland but we begin today with what weve seen in crypto over the weekend as we mentioned right at the top bitcoin at this hour trading around  but with the move back towards  weve seen bitcoins gains from that alltime high just about cut in halfnow we discussed last week guys the team over at bespoke investment group noted that the average decline for bitcoin within price cycles is about  or the median decline i should say is about  from peak to trough now throughout bitcoins history that has been from  to  thats been from  to  the numbers have gotten bigger the market cap gets bigger over timeand i think julie the question continues to be how much of an impact will a decline a sustained or even a shorter term decline in the price of cryptocurrencies bleed over into risk markets just given the dollar amounts now that are associated with some of these assets and i think the last couple of weeks have shown that the answer is certainly not zero and something notably higher than that because the riskon move were seeing today in stocks seems at least from my vantage point to be kind of an in sympathy rally with the at least shorter term more constructive action lets call it that were seeing in the crypto complex this morningjulie hyman i mean any given day you can pick any reason you like for risk on or risk off i suppose that seems as good a reason as any i mean given the washout that we heard about in a lot of particularly smaller crypto investors who were investing on margin borrowing on margin investing that money into crypto and then when they got caught on the downside got wiped out it makes sense that you would see some spilloverstory continueswhats also sort of fascinating to me is one of the buzzwords as weve talked about of the crypto bulls has been adoption adoption adoption right are we going to see more adoption on the part of institutional investors institutions have been another buzzword of these folks the problem now for those institutions is trying to get their arms around and offer advice on something which theyre not really used to analyzing right you know something without as fundamental a case and as a way to analyze and so i think a lot of the wall street strategists are trying to figure out how to advise clients on this now that you do have that broader adoptionand so when you have this confusion you also have i mean whats already a volatile market perhaps even more so if investors who are used to getting sort of concrete advice on companies that make stuff maybe that theyre sort of a little bit adrift maybe in this current environmentbrian sozzi no very important julie that you mentioned adoption i have a story right now on the yahoo finance home page and i think based on a new piece of research out of goldman sachs specifically their global head of digital assets matthew mcdermott has flown a little bit under the radar so far this morning but i expect hell get more attention hes saying bitcoin is now considered an investable asset in other words saying bitcoin is a new asset class and you go deeper into this research note and mcdermott is saying the interest theyre seeing from clients right now for bitcoin other cryptos is getting more significant and thats coming out of a goldman sachs so i imagine its also happening around the others in the investment banking community which gives credence are you reaching some form of shortterm bottom here in cryptosjulie hyman yeah and on a related note brian this is something you flagged for us this morning also from goldman sachs that coinbase was initiated with a buy rating at that firm the price target is  now not a lot of higher targets than that or i should say there are a lot of higher targets in that thats one of the lower targets actually for coinbase but the analyst says that you know obviously their future is tied to cryptocurrencies and how theyre going to do but among the ways to invest in crypto plays coinbase is sort of a blue chip way to do soso sozz i thought that was interesting theyre getting in here you know you tend to have after companies debut a little bit of time and then the banks start piling in with their calls so goldman obviously a big one to make that kind of callmyles udland yeah and i think the question for coinbase is going to be is coinbase i mean if you read their prospectus they say that all volatility essentially all volatility in the crypto space ends up being a net positive for them because in general all else equal that is going to increase the amount of trading that happens within the crypto space and more trading is better for coinbase though i think the way not i think if you look at how the stock has acted since it has come public it has basically been a lever to play on the value of cryptocurrencies generallyand whether and i think the question for coinbase longer term and you kind of think about it this way also you look at sibo and ice and the groups that are interactive brokers  so on and so forth the groups that are levered to trading activity within the stock market do they by proxy become levered bets on the value of stocks over time and im not sure how the answer shakes out there i think its a little bit less correlated than coinbase has been so far but the challenge for them will of course be able to reach this kind of escape velocity if we want to think about it that way where their stock price is not subject to the whims of what happens with the price of various cryptocurrencies and they can fully establish themselves as an investable case as a play that does not depend on the pricebut i think so far at least in the companys public market history and theyre wrapped up in a softer spac and direct listing ipo market as well so they have those factors going against them at the same time but they have not to this point been able to make themselves trade out of step lets call it with the value of broad cryptocurren
