on sunday bitcoin crashed  dealing what should be a wakeup call to those touting it as a store of value and a hedge against inflationthis won’t be the end for bitcoin whose backers range from libertarians who don’t trust governmentcreated or fiat money to those who lost faith in banks in the wake of the financial crisis as well some of the biggest names in finance like blackrock the world’s largest investment managerback when it was dreamed up in  by satoshi nakamoto it was conceived of as an alternative to the broken financial system that had just plunged the world into crisis a token that would liberate us from banks and make small payments cheaperthat dream now lies in tatters – and the answer to the question as to whether people will buy goods get mortgages or hold their pension pots in bitcoin or ethereum rather than euros and dollars should now be a resounding ‘no’ even if elon musk is prepared sell you a tesla for cryptothere’s no ‘full faith and credit’ behind cryptocurrenciesa rollercoaster ride has taken the world’s bestknown digital currency from a value some eight hundredths of a us cent in  to  € in january  to close on  at the end of that year it crashed down to just north of  by the end of  before starting its seemingly inexorable rise to  this yearthe digital currency is no stranger to the kind of crash we saw last weekend either in one day in june  it plunged  wiping  off the value of all cryptocurrenciesthe argument for bitcoin is that unlike fiat currencies where central banks can create money in unlimited amounts the total number of coins is capped at  million and that this means it will rise in value indefinitely due to evergrowing demandread moreeven if a cryptocurrency’s value cannot be inflated away by large supply increases that doesn’t automatically mean its value is stable in terms of ability to buy goods and services bitcoin also faces now faces competition – dogecoin originally a joke – surged  in value last weekthe biggest problem is bitcoin is intrinsically worth nothing and noone backs it unlike the dollar which is backed by the ‘full faith and credit’ of the us and whose value in terms of what you can buy with it is pretty predictable in the futurecontrast that with bitcoin earlier this year investment bank jpmorgan calculated the threemonth volatility of bitcoin to be  compared with  for gold the asset is it touted as a replacement for as an inflation hedgea collective moment of doubt could make bitcoin worthlessunlike a government bond which pays principal or gold which can be made into a bracelet you can do nothing with bitcoin and so its price will eventually fall to zero critics saymost mainstream economists have long considered bitcoin to be a distraction or downright dangerous to those who buy it as an investment and pose the question what exactly is the problem that it was supposed to solve that isn’t already addressed“their value depends entirely on selffulfilling expectations – which means that total collapse is a real possibility if speculators were to have a collective moment of doubt suddenly fearing that bitcoins were worthless well bitcoins would become worthless” says nobel prizewinning economist paul krugmanbitcoin could rise but that doesn’t make the argument less validyou can still buy that tesla it is just that bitcoin is probably one of the least efficient ways of doing so short of turning up with a wheelbarrow of cash
