in sharp contrast to the belief of his counterpart investors bill miller has completely refuted the speculations arising in the market that digital currency bitcoin is in a bubble and would collapse like  and  several nobel price economics winners have said that the currency is in a bubble warren buffet one of the world’s richest man has been a fierce critique of cryptocurrency saying that it has zero value and he would never invest in it he has called this year’s bubble a ‘mirage’on the other hand bill miller the legendary investor has a completely different viewpoint of the whole situation not only he feels that bitcoin is not in a bubble but also he feels it’s the beginning of the digital currency mainstream transformation in an interview given to the cnbc network yesterday he quoted “supply is growing  a year and demand is growing faster that’s all you really need to know and that means it’s going higher” miller has made a fortune in bitcoin and completely trusts the behavior it exhibits he invested first in bitcoin in  when one unit was priced around  and now when the price of the same has peaked around  he doesn’t shy away from investing more during this time period bitcoin has risen and fallen in  when it peaked at  and fell to lose about  of its value which it later gained in time he believes that volatility is the price we pay for its performance and these sharp price swings will continue in the futurebitcoin has outperformed every government currency that has ever existed because of its decentralized nature and the fact that it trades in a free market completely dependent on demand and supply which has made it establish its own economy once looked at with a doubtful eye bitcoin today is accepted as means of payment by major companies like microsoft tesla and burger kingmany people including eight nobel prize winners have called the currency a fraud due to its supposedly unpredictable nature but what they have failed to see that embedded in the data of movement is a behavior of bitcoin that it exhibits without a shift in pattern a new currency whose market is just over a decade old has been in a bubble thrice after an exact period of four years in   and now again in  three bubbles exactly four years apart wouldn’t suggest fraud but a pattern that could be due to the way the currency has been programmed an analysis of this scientific currency using statistical tools could be used to predict its value and fluctuations in it which would allow people to make smart investments and plan accordinglythe price of bitcoin has exhibited some kind of volatility with high and lows throughout its life in the market but these fluctuations have been promoted by dubious trading of inexperienced traders who have failed to see a pattern in the behavior of the cryptocurrency and have repeated their trading habitsindustrialists like elon musk have classified the behavior of cryptocurrency as ‘volatile but predictable’ and investors like bill miller have called it ‘digital gold’ saying it’s more precious than gold as it can be carried easily and can change hand within an instant with a touch on cellphones
