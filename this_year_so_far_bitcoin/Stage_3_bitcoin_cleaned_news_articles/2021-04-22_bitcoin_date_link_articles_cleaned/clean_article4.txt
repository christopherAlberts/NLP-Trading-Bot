money it’s often said is a shared fiction i give you a slip of paper or more likely these days a piece of plastic you hand me eggs or butter or a white chocolate mocha frappuccino and we both walk away satisfied with cryptocurrency the arrangement is more like a shared metafiction and the instability of the genre is presumably part of the thrill dogecoin a cryptocurrency that was created as a spoof has risen in value by eight thousand per cent since january owing to a combination of gamestopstyle pumping and boosterish tweets from elon musk on tuesday which backers proclaimed dogeday the cryptocurrency was valued at more than fifty billion dollars which is more than the market cap of ford coinbase a cryptocurrency exchange went public last wednesday almost immediately it became worth more than gmmore on the environment sign up to receive news and commentary in our climate crisis newsletterthe mainstreaming of cryptocurrency as it’s been called is obviously a big deal for the world of finance it’s also a big deal for the world of well the world this is particularly true in the case of the urcryptocurrency bitcoin like dogecoin bitcoin has recently surged in value in april  a coin was worth about seven thousand dollars today it’s worth more than fiftyfive thousand it hit a record high of  on april  but has since fallen off as the cost of investing in bitcoin has soared so too has the potential profit in “mining” it bitcoin mining is of course purely metaphorical but the results can be every bit as destructive as with the real thingaccording to the cambridge bitcoin electricity consumption index bitcoinmining operations worldwide now use energy at the rate of nearly a hundred and twenty terawatthours per year this is about the annual domestic electricity consumption of the entire nation of sweden according to the web site digiconomist a single bitcoin transaction uses the same amount of power that the average american household consumes in a month and is responsible for roughly a million times more carbon emissions than a single visa transaction at a time when the world desperately needs to cut carbon emissions does it make sense to be devoting a sweden’s worth of electricity to a virtual currency the answer would seem pretty clearly to be no and yet here we arethe greenidge generating station in dresden new york sits on the shores of seneca lake about an hour southeast of rochester it was originally built in the nineteenthirties to run on coal over the decades new units were added and older ones shuttered the power station ceased operations in  and it sat idle until it was purchased by a privateequity firm and converted to run on natural gas in  under the ownership of greenidge generation holdings the plant reportedly began operating as a “peaker plant” to provide power to the grid during times of high demand a spokesperson noted that the plant “is permitted to run ” then in  it was announced that the plant would power bitcoin miningmining is the process by which bitcoin is both created and accounted for instead of being cleared by say a bank bitcoin transactions are recorded by a decentralized network—a blockchain miners compete to register the latest “block” of transactions by solving cryptographic puzzles the first one to the solution is rewarded with freshly minted bitcoin miners today receive  bitcoins per block which at current values are worth more than three hundred thousand dollarsit’s unclear exactly who dreamt up bitcoin so no one knows what this person or persons was thinking when the mining protocols were first established but as ari juels a computer scientist at cornell tech recently explained to me the arrangement seems to have been designed with equity in mind anyone devoting a processor to the enterprise would have just as much stake in the outcome as anyone else as is so often the case though the ideal was soon subverted“what was quickly discovered is that specialized computing devices—socalled mining rigs—are much much more effective at solving these puzzles” juels said “and in addition there are economies of scale in the operation of these mining groups so the process of mining which was originally conducted by a loose federation of presumably individual participants with ordinary computing devices has now become heavily consolidated”because rig “farms” which are essentially like server farms consume a lot of energy bitcoinmining operations tend to chase cheap electricity roughly seventy per cent of bitcoin mining today takes place in china a recent study found that the associated electricity consumption could “potentially undermine” china’s efforts to curb its carbon emissions russia is also a bitcoinmining center—there are big operations in siberia where cold temperatures help keep rig farms from overheating—as is iran where electricity is subsidizedin the united states home to about seven per cent of the world’s bitcoin mining finding cheap power can be complicated a few years ago miners “descended upon” the city of plattsburgh new york about a hundred and fifty miles north of albany which gets much of its electricity from hydroelectric dams on the st lawrence river the power is relatively inexpensive but once plattsburgh uses up its allotment it has to purchase more at higher rates bitcoin mining drove up the cost of electricity in the city so dramatically that in  plattsburgh enacted a moratorium on new mining operationsbuying a generating station as greenidge generation holdings has done is a way around the problem let others pay retail greenidge now gets its power “behind the meter” the firm recently announced that it was going public via a merger with a nasdaqlisted company called supportcom and boasted that it “expects to be the first publicly traded bitcoin mining company with a whollyowned power plant” in the announcement greenidge said that it was planning to more than double its bitcoinmining operations in dresden by the fall of  and to double them again by the end of  it further declared that it intends to “replicate its vertically integrated mining model at other power sites”to expand its operations in dresden greenidge will have to burn more and more natural gas thus producing correspondingly more greenhousegas emissions the firm’s plans have sparked demonstrations in the finger lakes region on saturday a hundred protesters marched to the gates of the plant“this is a test case” joseph campbell the president of seneca lake guardian the group that organized the march told wrfi an ithaca radio station two days later the local planning board approved greenidge’s application to build four new structures at the site to house more mining rigs members of the planning board said that for legal reasons they were barred from considering the broader implications of their decision “we know that bitcoin is a big waste of energy” the chairman of the planning board david granzin said “but we’re bound by law”whether this is in fact the case is debatable what’s beyond debate—or should be at least—is that this is a matter that shouldn’t be left to a local planning board to decide there’s no way for new york or the us as a whole to meet its emissionsreductions goals if old generating stations rather than being closed are converted into bitcoinmining operations greenidge may become the first mining firm with a “whollyowned power plant” but unless the state or federal government steps in it won’t be the last another cryptocurrency firm digihost international has already applied to new york state’s public service commission for permission to purchase a naturalgasburning station near buffalo as representatives of earthjustice and the sierra club recently put it in a letter to officials of new york’s department of environmental conservation “additional scrutiny    is essential to prevent the floodgates opening for other retiring power plants”andrew yang the former presidential candidate who’s now running for mayor of new york city has said that he wants to turn the city into a cryptocurrencymining hub it’s hard to imagine a worse idea the city is already looking at spending billions of dollars to protect itself from sealevel rise increased emissions are pretty much the last thing it needs forwardlooking politicians should be thinking about ways not to buoy bitcoin mining but to bury it
