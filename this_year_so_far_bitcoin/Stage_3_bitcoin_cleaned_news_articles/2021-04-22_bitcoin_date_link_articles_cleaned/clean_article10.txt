with you in the previous point there are no plans or packages only you can determine the amount of capital you want to invest one tip is that you only allocate the investment capital once you have already covered your expenses  expenses services food transport insurance etc do i have to buy  full bitcoin no you can buy fractions of bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrenciesno you can buy fractions of bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies the exchange to which i can send funds from my bank does not include the cryptocurrencies that i want to buy what i can do using bitso as an example you can buy cryptocurrencies and send them to another exchange where you have registered you can do it with xrp and litecoin preferably given the low commissions and time it takes to reach your other exchangeis an exchange different from a portfolio yes the main difference is its purpose in an exchange you will have an address for each cryptocurrency that you acquire or with which you operate these exist to facilitate transactions between users and wallets and your own cryptocurrency portfolio whether physical or digital serves to store and protect your cryptocurrenciesa transfer of fundsonce you have investigated each exchange and registered in those that are most practical for you as well as in those whose cryptocurrency offer includes those of your interest and you have defined the amount you want to invest you can buy the cryptocurrencies you wantmarkets available in bitsobtc  mxneth  mxnxrp  mxnltc  mxnbch  mxntusd  mxnmana  mxnbat  mxndai  mxnfor each of the above you will have an address that will function as a wallet and that for the security of your account will change for each transaction however the addresses previously assigned to your account continue to work and credit funds in your bitso accounteach cryptocurrency has its own interest rate and operates under its own chain of blocks “blockchain” this is important since it determines the transfer costs to another exchange or wallet as well as the number of confirmations that a cryptocurrency requires to arrive to the destination portfolio these confirmations are a measure of how many blocks need to be created after the block in which your transaction was created it is basically a security measure and determines the time it takes for each transaction to reach its destinationb the role of cryptocurrencies like xrp and ltcat the beginning i shared with you that bitso is considered the bridge between crypto and fiat money this because of the ease of sending funds to the exchange either from your banking apps or in cash from oxxo as well as sending funds back to your bank account  where once your capital is available you will be able to operate in the mexican peso markets ofif the cryptocurrency you want to acquire is not in bitso and not in crypto com exchanges in which you can buy cryptocurrencies directly you must transfer funds to another exchange in which you already have a registered account and this is where cryptocurrencies such as xrp  litecoin ltc and stellar lumens xlm stand out for their low transaction fees and the number of confirmations required which in the case of xlm only requires a confirmation both xrp and ltc can be acquired in bitso so the process to acquire a cryptocurrency that is not in bitso would beit is important to point out for those who start in crypto that the destination addresses are of the cryptocurrencies that you are going to transfer if you purchased litecoin in bitso to transfer to another exchange enter the destination exchange choose litecoin and click on deposit this will show the address of your litecoin wallet on the destination exchange as well as the qr code to facilitate sendingin the case of sending xrp when you click on the destination exchange to reveal your xrp address you will also have a destination tag which you must include when transferring funds and is required to determine to which user the funds sent will be assignedonce your xrp or ltc have been received you can sell them for btc or a stablecoin usually usdt to use them to buy the cryptocurrency in which you are interested in investingc types of orderscryptocurrency exchanges on an exchange occur between buyers and sellers through order books or order books in which all purchase and sale offers are found these exchanges can be executed through orders frommarketin this type of orders there is no control over the price they are used when you want the transaction to be executed immediately at the best available price which will not always be the current price shown this type of order is used by the bitso and coinbase apps in bitso to buy or sell at specific prices it is recommended to use other types of orders in bitso alphalimitin these orders you set the price at which you want the purchase or sale of an asset to be executed and it is executed when the price you set coincides with the price of the order book it offers a better price than the market orderstop limitthis type of order offers greater control over the price since you set the price at which you want it to be executed the exchange converts it into a market order when the trigger price stop is reached it is at this time that the order is created in the order book and will be executed at the best available price now as a market order but which may not be fully executedwhat are the crypto and  or projects in which you want to invest
