the canada revenue agency cra is getting serious about taxing bitcoin just recently it reached a disclosure deal with coinsquare that forced the company to hand over user information to cra agents prior to that it set up a “cryptocurrency section” of its audit department specifically to deal with crypto investors broadly these actions suggest that the cra is getting serious about taxing cryptocurrency in this article i’ll explore the ramifications of that fact for investorscrypto gains treated like any other capital gainif you invest in cryptocurrency you probably know by now that you have to pay taxes on realized gains the question is how much tax you’ll have to pay for a long time that was a legal grey area canadian tax law wasn’t created in a world where cryptocurrency existed only recently has the agency weighed in and its conclusion was very favourable to investorscryptocurrency is considered a digital asset in the cra’s eyes that means it is subject to capital gains tax which has a much better tax treatment than income when you realize a capital gain only half of it is subject to taxation that’s in contrast to employment and business income which is  taxable so thanks to the cra’s tax treatment of crypto gains you will pay much less tax on such gains than you would on conventional incomethe bad newsthe bad news is this you will have to pay taxes on your crypto holdings when you sell themand you won’t be able to hide your holdings part of the reason why coinsquare agreed to fork over data to the cra was because it was forced to by a court so there is now legal precedent for crypto exchanges having to hand over customer data sooner or later other major exchanges will follow suit as the courts have said the cra has the legal standing to demand ita notax way to hold cryptoif you’re worried about taxes eating up your crypto gains there’s some good news and some bad newsthe bad news is that any crypto you currently hold in a taxable environment is fully taxable you do get the capital gains tax break which is very generous but there’s no way to avoid taxation on realized crypto gainsstory continuesthe good news is that you can hold bitcoin in a tfsa that is through a crypto etf like purpose bitcoin etf tsxbtccb while canadian banks still don’t offer an easy way to hold bitcoin in a conventional account they do allow you to put etfs like btccb in a tfsabtccb is a crypto fund that holds  of its portfolio in bitcoin a pure play in bitcoin it’s almost the same as holding the coin itself the only difference is that you pay a  fee on your holdings every year when you hold say  worth of bitcoin  of it in a given year will go to the fund’s managers that’s not nothing but compared to having to pay taxes on bitcoin it’s very little so by holding btccb in a tfsa you skip all usual capital gains taxes in exchange for a  annual fee that seems like a fair tradethe post bitcoin tax the cra goes hard after crypto appeared first on the motley fool canadamore readingfool contributor andrew button has no position in any of the stocks mentionedthe motley fool’s purpose is to help the world invest better click here now for your free subscription to take stock the motley fool canada’s free investing newsletter packed with stock ideas and investing advice it is essential reading for anyone looking to build and grow their wealth in the years ahead motley fool canada
