bitcoin cryptobtc and dogecoin cryptodoge have both been hot investments over the past  months surging  and  respectively at recent prices despite being built on similar technology these cryptocurrencies have very different origin storiesbitcoin was created by the pseudonymous satoshi nakamoto in  the mysterious nakamoto published a white paper detailing how bitcoin could be used to build a new financial system  one that reduced transaction costs by eliminating the need for financial institutionsby comparison dogecoin was created as a joke in  adobe employee jackson palmer referenced the popular doge meme in a tweet investing in dogecoin pretty sure its the next big thing at the time dogecoin didnt exist and his comment simply poked fun at the growing hype surrounding bitcoin however ibm software developer billy markus helped bring palmers joke to lifeso which of these redhot cryptocurrencies is the better investmentcryptocurrency is built on blockchaindespite being a joke dogecoin does have one redeeming quality like bitcoin its built on blockchain the peertopeer technology that powers cryptocurrenciesblockchain is a distributed ledger that records every transaction on a network its genius is that it eliminates the need for a central authority to mint and manage a currency instead the miners who make up the network are responsible for building and maintaining the blockchain think of them as auditors as dogecoin transactions occur miners group those transactions into blocks and validate each block through an energyintensive process known as proof of work that term isnt used lightly  it takes powerful hardware and significant computational effort to solve the cryptographic hashes ie solutions that validate each block of transactionsthe process is noteworthy for two reasonsfirst the sheer computing power needed for this process means its virtually impossible to hack the blockchain in fact an individual would need to control  of the computing power on the network to successfully alter the ledger in other words blockchain is a secure way to store datasecond when miners correctly solve a cryptographic puzzle and validate a block they are rewarded with a certain amount of cryptocurrency this incentive ensures that a wide network of miners processes transactions eliminating the need for financial institutions to act as intermediaries ultimately this means cryptocurrency transactions are subject to fewer feesheres the takeaway blockchain is a secure decentralized database that could form the foundation of a more efficient financial system thats one point in favor of both bitcoin and dogecoindogecoin has a critical flaworiginally dogecoin had a hard limit of  billion tokens similar to bitcoins cap of  million tokens however the developers changed their plans in  eliminating the supply constraints in other words as long as miners continue to build the blockchain more dogecoin will continue to wink into existencein fact each time a block is verified the miner receives a fixed reward of  dogecoin tokens unless the code is rewritten this will go on foreverthats a critical flaw in economics when demand is held constant the price of an asset goes down as the supply goes up and if the supply of an asset inflates to infinity the price should theoretically drop to zero unless the code is rewritten to introduce scarcity i believe thats where dogecoins price is headed it may not be this year or even this decade but eventually the excess supply will overwhelm demandby comparison bitcoin benefits from scarcity thats because every  blocks the reward paid out to miners is cut in half this effectively limits the supply to  million tokens in this case the economics at work are similar to those that govern the price of gold in other words both bitcoin and precious metals have value because they are rare and people want themno one can say for certain whether bitcoin is a good investment but it certainly appears to be a better investment than dogecoinso why is dogecoin up much of the hype surrounding dogecoin can likely be attributed to elon musk the brilliant leader of tesla and spacex has repeatedly tweeted on the topic for instance in april  musk said dogecoin might be his favorite cryptocurrency earlier in  musk posted a picture of a fictional magazine titled dogue a pun based on the popular publication voguehowever a few days later musk explained his commentary during a chat on clubhouse occasionally i make jokes about dogecoin but they are really just meant to be jokes musk also noted that the cryptocurrency itself was created as a jokeas a final thought consider this if the developers of dogecoin didnt take it seriously theres no reason for anyone else to take it seriously either and with no limit on the number of tokens dogecoin is no more scarce than air thats why investors should exercise great caution if they decide to dabble in this digital currency sure some people have struck it rich and other people may get rich on dogecoin in the future but someone usually wins the lottery every week too  and that doesnt mean you should sink your savings into lottery tickets
