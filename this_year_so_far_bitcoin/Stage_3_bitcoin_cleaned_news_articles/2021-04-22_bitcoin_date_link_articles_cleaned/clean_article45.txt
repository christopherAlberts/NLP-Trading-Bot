in our last article we wrote about hiding assets the oldfashioned way for much of this writer’s career the game was “cash” the pizzeria the auto body shop the produce vendor they lived in  square foot houses and drove luxury cars nevertheless the tax returns showed a mere  in income a remarkable achievementin the last  years the cash world has measurably changed i have worked alongside fellow lawyers who told me that i could turn them upside down and empty their wallets without finding more than  in cash when i stand in line at the convenience store today people in front of me are buying cigarettes and a sandwich with a debit or credit card the dry cleaner and yes even my local pizzeria will take plastic for any transaction over  so cash is dead rightwell not so fast when we first wrote about bitcoin and its companion cryptocurrencies in  it appeared that these would be assets accessible to the rich in january  a bitcoin commanded  and there were very few places to trade or exchange it a year later it had catapulted to  then it collapsed in january  it was worth  the beginning of  brought it back up to  still half of the value two years earlier so bitcoin had two problems it was not easily accessible to trade and it was highly volatile two sound reasons to stay away even if your goal was to hide assets from a spouse after all if you had  you wanted to hide in january  you could buy bitcoin and hope no one figured it out however a year later your crummy coin had lost  of its value worse than disclosing and sharing the asset with your unworthy spouse changed everything if you bought a “coin” early in  you paid  a year later your coin was worth  last week it was commanding  your dollar investment was now worth  then there was last saturday night when your bitcoin lost  of its value while you were in bed sleepinga few months ago i engaged a contractor to fix some things around my house as i signed his proposal he asked if i had any bitcoin i confessed that i was wary his response was his whole family had investments in bitcoin as he left i mused where his family would have access to acquire virtual coins at  a popa week ago i found my answer i was in the supermarket and as i departed i saw a currency machine at the front of the store where you bring your change or buy ice or umbrellas “bitcoin sold here” so now i can hit the grocery store for  in groceries and take  cash back i then wander over and put my  in the bitcoin machine that will get me  of a bitcoin assuming no one is going to ding me for a  commission to buy my spouse will never know because my bitcoin machine and i have a confidential relationship rightmy grocery store visit prompted me to wonder whether this was an aberration so i looked at a site to search for places that sold cryptocurrencies it is httpscoinatmradarcombitcoinatmnearme my office is  miles northwest of philadelphia in an affluent chester county suburb my search turned up  cryptocurrency vending machines within fifteen miles all but one was in a gas station or a convenience store perhaps american investors have shifted from brokerages to petrol stations my suspicion is that these investors are in fact lottery ticket buyers who decided that at least all is not lost when the winning ticket is drawnso i smell a cryptocurrency bubble emerging however this is not an investment blog what concerns me is the temptation to use a vending machine to hide assets when it’s right there in the grocery store or gas station unhappy spouses who don’t want to share their marital assets may be “parking” wealth at the bitcoin machinewhat’s the solution in a divorce setting it can be dubbed “forensics at home” gather a year of bank statements prepare a chart of cash withdrawals if you see a regular pattern of large cash withdrawals from particular places go look at the location and see if there are cryptocurrency machines we have just asked a client to do this and to his surprise his spouse had  in cash withdrawals over  months certainly we all need cash but when was the last time you spent an average of  a day in actual federal reserve currency every single day for  consecutive days that was in addition to  in groceries  in clothing and  in personal care expenses that showed as withdrawals for those purchases the clear message is that money is being palmed it used to be in the cigar box or a shoebox in the closet now the shoebox is at the gas station and the grocery store
