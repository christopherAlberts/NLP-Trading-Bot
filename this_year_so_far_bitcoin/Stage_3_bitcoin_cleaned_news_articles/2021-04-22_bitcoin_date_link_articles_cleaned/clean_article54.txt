cryptocurrency about  say they are currently invested in crypto and another  are planning to invest according to a nationwide poll conducted by piplsay researchmeanwhile  of respondents said they either didnt understand or hadnt even heard of cryptocurrencies this shows that cryptocurrency has a long way to go before it reaches maturity with plenty of growth potentiala bit of contextits important to put woods purchase of coinbase global into context after buying more than a million shares and spending hundreds of millions of dollars coinbase only amounts to a little more than  of funds under management for each of the three ark funds that hold the stockby adding coinbase into the mix however wood is increasing her bet on the overall potential for cryptocurrency without putting too many eggs in one basket
