bitcoin doesn’t fix defi its defi that fixes bitcoin“bitcoin fixes this” i cringe every time i see this popular memei find it worse than nails on a chalkboard bitcoin and other cryptocurrency crypto supporters seem to wheel this tired trope out for every problem they see particularly at economic ones to their credit they genuinely want to fix the financial system’s problems i do too however crypto’s supporters have their subjects completely reversedto be sure our modernday financial system has problems it’s plagued by “too big to fail” embarrassingly slow innovation poor user experiences and recurrent cronyism real and perceived like the cryptocrowd i see centralization as the root cause we agree decentralization is the only cure we need decentralize finance defiyet i see crypto as a sideshow it’s a distraction from the main event—truly decentralizing the financial system while these innovative tools are worthy of admiration crypto simply doesn’t address the root causes and quite frankly it can’t thus from an investment perspective i’m cautious when it comes to crypto at least from a fundamental thesis crypto’s best chance for utility is in a decentralized financial system not the other way aroundwhy decentralizationdecentralized systems are more stable than centralized ones this broad principle applies to all situations from investment portfolios to supply chains to insect colonies decentralization ensures that risks don’t concentrate such that a single failure point can bring the whole system down centralization breeds instability and fragility this is all too evident in our financial systemunfortunately there are several modernday examples of centralized risks threatening entire economies “too big to fail” banks in  and longterm capital management’s epic collapse in  are notable ones here the failure of literally a handful of institutions endangered the entire economy how could this possibly be the global economy is enormous that we all were thrust into a nowin situation—to foot the bill for these actors’ mistakes or suffer hefty consequences by no fault of our own—is as astonishing as it is unjust yet it happened and centralization is to blamebanking is centralizedcentralization in financial markets is extremely high and for good reason they are among the most heavily regulated industries whether we like it or not laws regulations and mandates are centralizing forces in two ways first they limit competition by erecting barriers against new entrants these can take the form of compliance requirements licensing limitations and other costs more perniciously though they create behavioral herding regulations coerce companies to act in similar ways not because they or their customers necessarily want them to but rather to satisfy some mandate quite simply companies must optimize for the rules in order to competethe great financial crisis of  gfc illustrated just this banks are subject to a myriad of regulatory capital requirements across the globe these stringent rules dictate how much and in what forms companies must carry reserves to cover potential losses and liquidity needs as if banks wouldn’t in their absence they are codified formulas literally to which each company is subject for better or worse the ratings from nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations nrsro such as moody’s investors service and standard  poor’s feature prominently in these calculations thus their anointed opinions impact the actions of every bank preceding the gfc only three nrsros mattered moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings their wrong assessments of housingrelated investments brought the world to its knees in partthe way in which politicians write laws regulators formulate rules nrsros assess risk and lobbyists sway competitive dynamics are paramount to how banks manage their businesses what choice do management teams really have but to comply the alternative is not to operate this is how a few favored groups without “skin in the game” can transform seemingly benign views such as home prices never go down into dangerous and systemic risk concentrationsdecentralized and “free” bankingwhat if there were no banking laws would bankers ignore all risks and treat their capital like unconstrained madmen of course they wouldn’t those who did would not be in business for long there are always outliers history confirms this unpopular viewfreed from codified capital requirements banks would create a whole host of different risk management strategies they would because it’s a business necessity there is no greater regulator than the market to be sure a range of efficacies would emerge with some banks proving safer than others this diversity though would prove protective it dampens the threat of systemic failure due to any one bank’s action the wisdom of crowds protects us all by localizing the damage of mistakesin my view crypto’s biggest promise is to help decentralize financial services—aka defi defi is the practical solution for the centralized financial system’s failures however we don’t need crypto to decentralize banking and finance socalled “free banking” is hardly novelfree banking existed to various degrees throughout history most notably in scotland canada and the antebellum period in the us during these periods banks were lightly regulated and issued private notes that were convertible into gold these notes widely circulated and acted as currency while far from perfect the financial system’s stability in these periods compares favorably to our current ones based on central banks this is due to the decentralizationsource altmorga tally of recessions bank panics and bank failures reveals that “ widespread belief among economists historians and journalists that the federal reserve  was an essential major improvement appears to be no more than unreflective faith in government economic management with little foundation in the historical evidence”before crypto there were shadow banksthe financial system’s fragility is an unnecessary and terrifying risk in my view thus i absolutely love that crypto’s mission is defi bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are essentially workarounds to archaic laws and financial regulations that prevent innovation competition and ultimately concentrate systemic risks however in these regards crypto is not uniquethere is already a large and burgeoning industry busy at working around regulations to increase efficiency in finance it’s callously known as the shadow banking or eurodollar system the shadow banking system is a network of interconnected financial services companies spanning the globe it operates in the “shadows” ie favorable offshore jurisdictions to escape regulatory scrutiny and oversight hence its moniker in essence shadow banking is an attempt at defi while it gets a bad rap particularly due to its role in the gfc the shadow banks have been quite effective at improving the industry’s performancenote though that when the shadow banking system failed in the gfc it was around common points of centralization capital efficiency is the name of the game when it comes to financial services however there’s only so much wiggle room to circumvent capital requirement rules thus the shadow banks naturally piled into similar assets as they sought to optimize for these regulatory constraints unfortunately the regulations proved dangerous the nsros were very wrong about home prices and the safety of the assets they backed the result was system collapse around this common vulnerability that regulations createdwhile the shadow banking system is crafty it is not perfect in my view it wouldn’t exist in a lightly regulated regime maintaining this complex patchwork of interconnected entities around the globe requires lots of expertise and skill said differently it’s expensive simplifying the landscape removes the need for these workarounds that only add complexity opacity and cost to an already intricate industry thus liberalizing banking is the only way to eliminate the shadow banks it’s the only way to remove their utility it’s also the only way to create defiin my view it’s folly to think crypto is a defi gamechanger rather i see it as merely an evolution in the perpetual “cat and mouse game” played between productive financiers and overbearing regulators is there really a fundamental difference between shadow banks and decentralized tokens both exist to evade jurisdictional roadblocks to efficiency innovation and progress instead crypto seems like a new tool to be used towards defi’s endcrypto requires proper growing conditionsto be sure crypto may be able to exist on the fringe even in a hostile political environment its decentralized nature makes it hard to regulate by design however we—the users—do not live like this humans can only be in one place at a time we live centralized existences with homes families bank accounts etc that fall within specific jurisdictions our lives to certain extents are regulatablecannabis is good analogy despite being illegal you can find it almost everywhere however it’s a significantly smaller industry than it would be otherwise institutions ie companies and capital can’t touch it due to its legal status only when this changes can the cannabis industry thrive we’re beginning to see this nowin order for crypto to thrive we need defi first while it can help crypto is powerless to address the root cause of centralization the problem is the design of the financial system itself defi is more meta than crypto it requires a complete change of our views of finance we need to reorient them and free financiers from their bureaucratic overlords these are political issuescrypto is like a seed struggling to sprout it requires proper soil conditions to bloom you can’t grow a sequoia tree in sand no matter how promising the seedling the same goes for crypto fix the soil and only then can crypto thrive this why i remain skeptical of crypto from an investment perspectiveputting the horse before the cartto be sure today’s financial system has problems it’s an overall poor user experience with an outsized influence on our lives while many look to bureaucrats for solutions this is counterproductive the cause is the industry’s centralization which laws and regulations largely createothers rightfully see defi as the answer and are increasingly turning to crypto for help while admirable crypto cannot bring forth defi defi can only result from liberating the financial services industry from its onerous legal and regulatory frameworks that create the dangerous centralization while the shadow banking system is working hard to debottleneck these regulatoryinduced inefficiencies it can only do so much and has its own shortcomingsto be sure crypto may be part of the defi future but its supporters have it backwards defi is the prerequisite not the result it’s the enabling condition and unlocks crypto’s promising utility defi is not a matter of technology it’s a matter of political philosophyno bitcoin doesn’t fix this ie enables defi this
