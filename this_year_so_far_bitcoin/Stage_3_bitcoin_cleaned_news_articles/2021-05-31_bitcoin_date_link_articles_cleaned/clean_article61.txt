the trustee presiding over the mt gox civil rehabilitation case has taken the next step toward partially reimbursing victims who lost money to the cryptocurrency exchange in hacks that date back nearly a decade as of today claimants can begin to vote on whether or not they will accept the civil rehabilitation proposalthe deadline for claimants to cast their vote online is oct significantly the notice from the trustee statesif you do not vote you will be deemed to have voted against the draft rehabilitation plan for the requirement of the amount of the voting rightsbecause a minimum threshold of  of votes is required in order for the proposal to pass there is a chance the proposal could fail even if the majority of votes actively cast vote in favor of acceptancehow the payouts could workaccording to a letter sent to claimants last year the proposed payout would reimburse creditors in both jpy and btc or bch the total value of each claim is denominated in japanese yen jpy with each bitcoin being pegged to nearly  the rough price of bitcoin when the civil rehabilitation began in  not the  price of today but also not the few hundreds of dollars bitcoin was trading at when mt gox fellsubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policymt gox was hacked recurrently from  eventually driving it into insolvency since  bankruptcy proceedings have evolved into these rehabilitation proceedings the drawnout drama means some exhausted creditors sold their claims to law firms individuals and other stakeholders in the caseaccording to the terms of the proposal if a claimant filed a fiat bankruptcy claim back in the day they would be entitled to a priority payment for the full sum lost plus damagesfor everyone else there are a few optionsfirst all approved creditors will receive a base payment of up to  jpy approximately  usd that will count toward their total claimfrom there they can choose between two options they can opt for a faster earlysum payment which will reimburse them for about  of their first claim or they can also choose to wait for what could be potentially a few more percentage points but this isn’t guaranteedin other words someone who lost  btc and  who selects the “early sum” payment would receive a base small sum payment of  jpy  usd along with  btc  bch and  jpy for an approximate value of nearly  usdshould that same person select the later “final” payment options they could see that amount go up to around  usd but it could also dip lower than the early sum amount of there is no guarantee that the price will go up or down because mt gox currently holds over  btc and  bch and some  billion jpy of fiat but they have a total of  btcbch and  billion jpy in approved claims and  btcbch and  billion jpy per a wizsec blog post which explains payout details there are also some claims awaiting approval so at this point there is no way of knowing exactly what the final total disbursement amount to all creditors will bealso up for clarification is how those funds will be denominated creditors who lost funds in fiat currencies will be paid in jpy any cryptocurrency amounts owing will be reimbursed in a mix of btc andor bch and jpywizsec estimates that  of the dollar amount for btcbch claims will likely have to settle in jpy due to the shortage of cryptocurrency funds recovered and the numerous exchanges for fiat that have been conducted over the years any disbursement in cryptocurrencies will be sent to exchanges included on a whitelist approved by the trusteecreditors can get an estimate of their potential payout should the proposal pass the vote by using the payout calculator on wizsec’s latest post regarding the rehabilitation proceedingsvoting for an end to the dramashould the proposal be accepted by the majority of stakeholders individuals can then decide which of the two options early or final settlements they will choose for themselvesshould the vote fail it will be back to the drawing board for the trustee and the board leaving creditors waiting for a new proposal to be drawn up considering the years it has taken for this proposal to be created failure to accept these terms would likely force creditors to wait even longer for any compensation
