in related case federal court holds that bitcointobitcoin tumbler can represent money transmissionon april  irs ci and fbi special agents arrested roman sterlingov a dual citizen of russia and sweden for his alleged role as the founder and operator of bitcoin fog a cryptocurrency tumbler or mixer aimed at concealing the source of funds the criminal complaint and accompanying statement of facts filed in the district of columbia alleges that over the course of  years bitcoin fog moved more than  million bitcoin valued at the time of the transactions at about  million according to the governments press release he bulk of this cryptocurrency came from darknet marketplaces and was tied to illegal narcotics computer fraud and abuse activities and identity theftsterlingov allegedly founded the site while promoting it under the pseudonym akemashite omedetou a japanese phrase that means happy new year in a post on an online bitcoin forum omedetou advertised that bitcoin fog  up your bitcoins in our own pool with other users and can eliminate any chance of finding your payments and making it impossible to prove any connection between a deposit and a withdraw inside our serviceironically sterlingov was identified by investigators using the very same sort of tracing that bitcoin fog was meant to forestall the statement of facts outlines in extensive detail how sterlingov allegedly paid for bitcoin fogs domain using a nowdefunct digital currency it goes on to show a series of transactions recorded to the blockchain that identifies sterlingovs purchase of that currency with bitcoin based on tracing those financial transactions investigators were able to identify sterlingovs home address and phone number together with a google account that hosts a document that describes how to obscure bitcoin payments – that document mirrors closely the methods sterlingov allegedly employed to purchase the bitcoin fog domainin addition to thanking various domestic law enforcement agencies the governments press release highlights the international nature of the investigation by also thanking europol and swedish and romanian law enforcement agencies the criminal complaint against sterlingov is therefore another example of ircci pursuing its simultaneous goals of fighting cryptorelated crime and collaborating with foreign law enforcement officials in order to do sonotably this is the second case brought by the department of justice criminal divisions computer crime and intellectual property section targeting virtual currency mixer operations in united states v harmon a case also being prosecuted in the district of columbia the defendant has similarly been charged for his alleged role in operating helix a bitcoin mixer that sent more than  million in bitcoin to designated recipientsboth harmon and sterlingov have been charged with among other offenses i violating  usc §  for operating a money transmitting business without an appropriate money transmitting license in the district of columbia ii  usc §  for failing to comply with the money transmitting business registration requirements of the bank secrecy act bsa and iii engaging without a license in the business of money transmission in violation of the district of columbias money transmitters act mtaharmon irecent decisions in the harmon case regarding the applicability of those statutes to cryptomixing operations strengthens significantly the governments case against sterlingov last year harmon moved to dismiss the indictment against him claiming that bitcoin is not money under the mta and that helix was similarly not a money transmitting business under the bsa after considering among other things the way bitcoin is used as medium of exchange method of payment and store of value the court held that the statutory term money includes bitcoin and more specifically that the mta covers bitcoinbased money transmitter businesses such as helix as to harmans challenge of the applicability of  usc §  harman argued that that offense requires the transmission of funds from one person or location to another person or location and that the indictment failed to allege that helix did anything other than return bitcoin to the user from whom it was initially sent the court disagreed helixs business according to the court was receiving bitcoin to send to another location or person in order to mask the original source of those funds – under the relevant authorities that qualified as money transmissionharmon iimore recently harmon moved once more to dismiss the charges against him for violating the bsa and mta arguing that these statutes are voidforvagueness as applied against helixs business operations according to harmon he was under no notice that either the bsa or mta were applicable to a bitcointobitcoin transaction that involved no fiat currency harmon argued that because of purported overlapping regulation and confusion between the commodity futures trading commission the internal revenue service the securities and exchange commission and other government entities on how to classify and regulate bitcoin tumblers  regulations regarding bitcoin tumbling qualifying as money transmitting business could not have been sufficiently clear between  and here too the court disagreed notably in rejecting harmons challenge to the bsa the court referenced fincen guidance from  that was sufficiently broad to cover bitcoin tumbling operations like helix more specifically the court cited to  mar   which declined to distinguish between virtual currency and fiat currency and deemed the transfer of anything of value that substitutes for currency as transmission under the bsa the court also observed that that guidance specifically states that a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts    decentralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another personin all the prosecutions of harmon and sterlingov are a clear indication that the government will seek to hold cryptotocrypto services accountable under the traditional money transmission laws including the bsa and mta as for the prosecution against sterlingov in particular the case shows yet another example of how cryptocurrency once widely considered to be a powerful instrument for anonymous untraceable transactions has
