you can do more with spv than you think ‘bitcoin class with satoshi’ talks databases and hash chains video can’t be loaded because javascript is disabled spv and databases we’re talking spv again on this week’s edition of “bitcoin class with satoshi” a series of technical discussions between scrypt’s xiaohui liu and bitcoin creator dr craig s wright and it’s not just about making payments the two discuss logging events database storage and functionality content delivery hash tables and transaction logging—without needing to store every piece of data on every nodecontinuing with the theme of previous episodes we’re discussing what information needs to be stored and accessed onchain and what can be done elsewhere think about what spv does on a basic level it stores the hash header and only the transactions you care aboutquotable nothing thats on the internet about how these things work outside of what ive told you is right   — xhliu sinotrinity may  “what i want you to think about is if we extend it from the two of us and what if i’m running a company database i might have a database of all my records and i can have different levels of encryption external storage hashing all available in the equivalent of a sharded system where no one really knows what matches unless they’re part of the hierarchy of all the parts of this that get put together”or in other words how to put lots of information out there but not everyone has to have it“not every node has to do everything that stupid bloody ethereum mentality needs to go every node can be unique”the two refer to cdns content delivery networks and storage systems like alchemy and ipfs and how they organize information much can be done similarly using spv—dr wright says he’s seen people begin to put html code in transactions and theoretically they could include sql and other database commands in the script itselfxiaohui notes that several systems like this already exist but dr wright counters that the ones that do are generally messy and are subject to data loss and hash tables that don’t point anywhere if something is removed bitcoin he says does the same thing but with availability guaranteed years into the future and does it provably you could even rebuild some of the existing ones on bitcoinfor example ipfs he says is “an anarchist shitshow… it doesn’t work for a reason” it’s made by people who distrust laws and distrust companies and hence nothing works this is also the problem with half these nfts right now he adds there’s no guarantee what the token you purchased even points to if anything what is the component that is “real”corporations could build business models on top of bitcoin this way dr wright says you might need access to another firm’s data or code but not want to store it—using spv you could keep only what you need matching it against a hash header you could keep differentgrouped spv groups on an external database that defines what they all meanthese concepts exist in it already bitcoinspv is not necessarily different in functionality to what other cdn systems do it’s just better and more secureusing merkle proofs someone can validate whole chains of hashes with only a small amount of information this validation by processors can be trusted and their veracity proven“tell me what sort of things you might be able to start building” dr wright says he and xiaohui discuss methods for provable strings and some of the potential use cases which as they note are unboundedit’s clear that even for experienced developers and likely even for experienced bitcoiners a shift in thinking will be necessary to really grasp what bitcoin can do thinking outside the box of existing processes and functionalities requires creativity and a better knowledge of bitcoin’s capabilities bitcoin class with satoshi continues to provide a good introduction to theseto watch previous episodes of the theory of bitcoin and bitcoin class with satoshi check out the theory of bitcoin youtube channel here and the bitcoin class with satoshi youtube channel herenew to bitcoin check out coingeek’s bitcoin for beginners section the ultimate resource guide to learn more about bitcoin—as originally envisioned by satoshi nakamoto—and blockchain
