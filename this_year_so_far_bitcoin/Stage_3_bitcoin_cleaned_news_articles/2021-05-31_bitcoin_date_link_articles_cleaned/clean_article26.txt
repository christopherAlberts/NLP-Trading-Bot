described by some as an investment roller coaster ride the value of bitcoin and its unabating volatility can be difficult to comprehendthe fluctuations in bitcoin’s value acts as both a draw and a deterrent to investors in what has been described by many commentators as a modernday gold rush the true extent of bitcoin’s investment volatility can be best understood by examining two hypothetical investment scenariosinvestor a bought  worth of bitcoin on march   at the time they were able to buy roughly two bitcoin having held them for exactly twelve months he exchanged their bitcoin back to us dollars on april   receiving  and generating a profit of  or an annualized return of investor b bought  worth of bitcoin on april   the same date investor a chose to sell they were able to buy roughly one quarter of a bitcoin just  weeks later their bitcoin holdings have dropped in value by  and are worth around  representing a loss of  if sold thenwith its capacity to deliver such lucrative returns its easy to understand the allure of bitcoin investing and why many overlook the risks associated with its volatilityhowever it is more difficult to comprehend why the value of bitcoin is so volatile to do so it’s necessary to examine the fundamental principles underpinning the bitcoin phenomenonwhat is bitcoinin simple terms bitcoin is a cryptographically secure currency which mimics cash’s function as final settlement and only bitcoin does so digitally allowing for worldwide transactions whilst digital currencies do not have a physical form they offer a medium through which payments for goods services or other standard forms of currency can be made without the spender and receiver being present together in the same physical locationlaunched in  bitcoin was the first “cryptocurrency”although many other forms of digital currency have been introduced both before and after this bitcoin remains by far the most valuable and high profile and this trend appears to be continuingits skyrocket rise in popularity is divisive amidst commentators and public figures with opponents suggesting that the historic trajectory of its value growth is unsustainable in the long termthis argument is combated by bitcoin’s supporters who believe that bitcoins fundamental scarcity and limitations in supply will continue to drive its value up for many years to comedespite being a nonphysical asset bitcoin is a finite resource this serves to further increase its appeal amongst investors keen to buy in at the right time the factors underpinning this scarcity are inherent within bitcoin’s designwhy is bitcoin a finite resourcemining costs“mining” is the process through which bitcoin is produced and enters into public circulationbitcoins are awarded as a prize known as a “bitcoin block reward” to individuals referred to as “miners” for solving complex algorithmic equations using specially adapted high powered computersthis process becomes exponentially more difficult and resourceintensive as time progresses requiring more powerful hardware and consuming more energy as a consequence the average cost of creating bitcoin increases on a daily basislimited supplyunlike traditional forms of currency the supply of bitcoin is limited by design based on the current protocols the total number of bitcoins that can ever come into existence is capped at  millionover  million bitcoin  of the total available supply are already in circulation and as outlined above the mining process is becoming slower and more expensivehalving eventsthe rate at which bitcoin is released into circulation is cut in half on a cyclical basis this process known as “halving” makes the mining of bitcoin less rewarding and more costly over timehistorically halving events have resulted in extreme short term upward fluctuations in value which have eventually stabilized and resulted in a longer term increase according to forbes after the first halving bitcoin prices jumped from  to  a pattern which has been replicated in subsequent eventsdoes scarcity create volatilitythe above factors all serve to reinforce the perception that bitcoin is becoming increasingly scarce however a lack of supply does not create volatility by itself it is instead the combination of supply inflexibility mixed with extreme fluctuations in investor demand that gives rise to market swingsjust like traditional products traded on the stock exchange bitcoin’s price fluctuations are driven by investor demand this is heavily influenced by public perception and with its high profile and regular press coverage it is arguable that bitcoin is disproportionately impacted by investor sentimentwidespread skepticism regarding the longterm future and fundamental purpose of bitcoin creates uncertainty in the market as the technology is new to the worldthis fundamental uncertainty within a reactive pool of investors mixed with scarcity in supply are the driving forces behind bitcoin’s volatilityindeed the direct link between public perception and bitcoin’s value was recently demonstrated when elon musk who had previously shown his public support of bitcoin creating a surge in value said in a tweet that tesla would stop accepting bitcoin as a payment method because of the enormous amount of energy needed to mine such a statement caused a dip in bitcoin’s priceconversely suggestions that governmental legislative reforms will further regulate digital currencies are often attached to a decline in bitcoin’s perceived dollar valueconclusionit is clear that the bitcoin roller coaster ride is far from over and those aboard should prepare themselves for a bumpy ride still it represents an opportunity to invest in a future of freedom built on bitcoin by simply educating yourself about bitcoin you have already taken the first step in preparing for this futurethis is a guest post by mauricio carrillo opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not
