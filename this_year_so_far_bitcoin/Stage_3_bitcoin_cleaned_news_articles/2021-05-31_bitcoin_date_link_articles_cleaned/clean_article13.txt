mumbai the raging debate among cryptocurrency investors after the shock and awe crash of the previous two weeks is whether this is the beginning of sustained bear market in bitcoin or mere clearing of the froth created by leveragebased tradingafter hitting an alltime high of  on april  bitcoin has now given up  per cent of its gains with virtually every buyer of the cryptocurrency since february in losses after the dramatic crash which saw the cryptocurrency tumble to nearly  the currency has moved in a range of  in the past few days suggesting that the market is still finding its feet after being dazed by the selloffthe selloff in late may in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies was largely driven by regulatory actions taken by china against cryptocurrency dealings and miners which snowballed into liquidation of leveragebased positions in the market taken by shortterm holders of the coinaccording to bybtcom as many as  trading accounts were liquidated on may  alone reflecting the sheer magnitude of losses for investors currently around  per cent of the bitcoin supply held by shortterm traders less than  days is underwater after the crash according to data available on glassnodeinterestingly longterm holders of bitcoin defined as those who have held their coin for a period of more than  days have not panicked in the crash of the past two weeks“lths overall have returned to accumulation this suggests that early bull market buyers prices less than  have hodled a reasonable volume of supply and should this trend continue may indicate a longer term supply squeeze is in play” glassnode said in its newsletter released on mondayat the same time bitcoin miners have also started to accumulate their coins during the crash with two major players in the market showing gumption for accumulation of the cryptocurrency after such a rapid fall it should lend confidence to investorsyet the fact remains that the longer bitcoin price stays closer to the  mark the more difficult it will get for shortterm coin holders who are deep in the red holding their coins therefore the majority of the selling pressure will come from this lot as they are likely to use any bounce to sellwhat will determine the fate of the bitcoin market going ahead is what the longterm holders of the coin who purchased it during december and january will do these coin holders are still at cost on their holding since the price is hovering around the  threshold“lths on the other hand remain largely in profit but approaching the nupl net unrealised profit or loss threshold of  in previous cycles this has signalled the start of more bearish trends as lths tend to capture remaining unrealised gains” glassnode notedfor the time being therefore it is likely that the bitcoin market may go nowhere till either the longterm holders or the shortterm sellers assert their dominance in this tug of war
