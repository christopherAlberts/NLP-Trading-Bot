even though we have seven months left in  theres little question that this is going to be remembered as the year retail investors made their presence knownbeginning in january retail investors on reddits wallstreetbets chatroom began piling into stocks with high levels of short interest with the sole purpose of effecting a short squeeze since a majority of shortsellers are institutional investors this trade took on the feel of a david vs goliath battleand its not just equities that have been whipsawed wildly by retail traders cryptocurrencies have rocketed higher this year with retail investors exerting a lot of influence on crypto exchangesamc and dogecoin are blatant pumpanddump schemesthe result is that weve witnessed plenty of stocks and digital currencies head to the moon  many of which have no business whatsoever being valued where they areat the forefront of this retail movement are movie theater chain amc entertainment nyseamc and cryptocurrency dogecoin cryptodoge while investors in amc and dogecoin would like to believe there are tangible reasons behind their respective moves higher there arent theyve both been driven by a combination of hype ignorance of fact and the spread of misinformationin other words amc and dogecoin are nothing more than pumpanddump schemes in action thats where investors  especially early investors  use exaggerated and false claims to drive up the price of an asset its impossible to tell when these schemes will implode but history is crystal clear that bubbles like these burst  of the time and end with hefty losses for momentumchasing investorsthe big question is which of these two amc or dogecoin is the biggest pumpanddump scheme at the moment lets have a closer lookwhy amc entertainment is a pumpanddump stockreddit traders whove piled into amc have done so for one reason they believe institutional investors have been playing dirty by shortselling amc and are looking for the mother of all short squeezes as they put it as a reminder short squeezes are usually very shortterm events where pessimists who feel trapped in their positions buy to cover their shares held short when a lot of pessimists head for the exit at once it can create a very temporary spike in a companys share priceunfortunately there are a lot of things wrong with amc it starts with retail investors purposely ignoring the companys fundamentals ie its operating performance and balance sheet retail traders will say that fundamentals are irrelevant to a short squeeze but history has proven  of the time that fundamentals always matter when it comes to longterm valuation historically speaking betting on short squeezes has been a suckers beta few of the problems with amc includea  decline in movie ticket industry salesa morethandoubling in its net interest payments on corporate borrowings in the first quarter amc has virtually no chance of paying back its debts when they come due in deferred rent obligations of  millionbut you wont hear about any of these things from retail investors because it would damage their thesisinstead retail traders have taken to reddit and twitter to spread misinformation about the role institutional investors have played with amc and to perpetuate wild conspiracy theories of how the investing world works theyve claimed hedge funds tried to bankrupt amc and that the share price will rise because retail traders now control the float neither statement is accurate company actions and operating results determine whether a company goes bankrupt or succeeds no matter how many hedge funds short it or how many retail traders own itits impossible to tell when the hype train will derail but it eventually always doeswhy dogecoin is a pumpanddump crypto assetbut amc isnt alone retail investors in the crypto space are also attempting to pull the wool over unsuspecting investors eyes with their own combination of hype ignorance of fact and misinformation surrounding memebased cryptocurrency dogecoindogecoin enthusiasts have bet the farm on the idea that dogecoin has lower transaction fees than the big two in crypto bitcoin and ethereum and that dogecoin will benefit from increased adoption tesla ceo elon musk has also regularly voiced his support for dogecoin on twitterthe problem is that theres nothing tangible in its sails as an example proponents of dogecoin like to talk up its increased adoption but theyll fail to mention that its  transactions handled daily dont even move the needle next to the  million payments processed by visa and mastercard combined on a daily basis theyll also tell you to get in early on dogecoin before businesses start accepting it but will leave out that in eight years only  businesses have chosen to allow it as a form of paymentwhats more dogecoin supporters talk up its lower transaction fees but leave out some other important details for instance that dogecoins transaction fees are substantially higher than the likes of stellar nano ripple dash ethereum classic and bitcoin sv just to name a few or that its validating and settlement speeds are considerably slower than many of these popular networks including bitcointhe only real catalyst for dogecoin and im sorry to say this is tweets from elon musk imagine your entire investment thesis being based on the hope that elon musk posts a meme or mentions dogecoin in a tweet suffice it to say dogecoin investors are constantly having to hype it up on social media platforms to keep the price from collapsingand the biggest destroyer of future wealth isnow its time to answer the original question which of these two amc or dogecoin is the bigger pumpanddump schemeas you can probably tell i like neither company as an investment if i had to choose the two mostdangerous places to put your money to work and i mean dangerous in a negative context it would be amc and dogecoin but when it comes to which is a bigger pumpanddump scheme dogecoin takes home the crownwhy the simple answer is that amc has income statements balance sheets and industry trends that can be pored over to make reasonbased investment decisions even if todays traders choose to ignore that tangible data its also previously been a profitable company and could be so again in  or beyond its even possible that amcs management team gains concessions in the future that allow for more shares to be issued which would help the company reduce its debt load and take a potential bankruptcy by or before  off the tabledogecoin has none of this its transaction costs arent particularly low next to some other major blockchains and its slow processing speeds leave a lot to be desired very few businesses are accepting dogecoin and its entire runup is based on tweets from elon musk if thats not the dictionary definition of a pumpanddump scheme then i dont know what is
