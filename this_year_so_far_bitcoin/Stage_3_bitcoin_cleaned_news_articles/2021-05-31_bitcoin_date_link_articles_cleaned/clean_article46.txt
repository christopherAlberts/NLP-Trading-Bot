letters to the editor june  bitcoin no bargain for the planetbitcoin’s price on our planeteditor a recent indextribune article “chaching bitcoin rolls into sonoma” march  marvels over the fact that many sonoma businesses are being asked more and more to accept the cryptocurrency bitcoinindeed in the last  years the united states has experienced an explosive growth of bitcoin along with dozens of other new cryptocurrency companies concerns about this revolutionary digital “money” have focused mainly on its lack of any government backing or regulations and on its extreme volatility as an investment assetbut now we are challenged by an accelerating climate crisis and a desperate race against destruction of the planet’s life support systems it is critical therefore that the significant climate impacts of these cryptocurrencies be addressed with regulationsaccording to bill gates bitcoin alone uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to humankind operating bitcoin with its huge blockchain computer networks as well as the mining of precious metals for the bitcoins consumes more electricity than is generated by all the world’s solar panels combined it also is estimated that bitcoin produces as much  each year as a million transatlantic flightsthat’s just for bitcoin imagine what the climate impacts are from the dozens of new cryptocurrency companies now eagerly competing with bitcoin naomi klein’s book title “this changes everything capitalism vs the climate” captures the challenge before usjohn donnellysonomapacaso a ‘glorified timeshare’editor are we willing to sell out our neighborhoods to the highest bidder “sonoma neighborhoods fights controversial new homebuying model” may  that’s indeed the question that pacaso raises for the residents of sonoma pacaso is a new real estate company backed by hundreds of millions of dollars of funding they’re buying up properties in sonoma napa and other wine country destinations they offer “fractional” ownerships of  of a home which is a glorified timeshare as your “ownership” in a pacaso home is defined by the amount of time you’re allowed to stay  ownership give you  days but no more than two weeks at a time which you can give to family and friends they fancy themselves “disrupters” but the only thing they’re disrupting are our local neighborhoods the only thing innovative about this company is their legal strategy at avoiding timeshare regulations and taxespacaso is litigious and they’re bullies they’re suing the city of st helena in napa because st helena classifies pacaso as a timeshare and won’t allow it pacaso won’t hesitate to sue local municipalities to get their way do the local communities have the money to challengefor those wondering well how is this different from airbnb people who stay at airbnb pay transient occupancy taxes into our local community pacaso users will not pay this tax there are also regulations in place for where airbnbs and other vacation rentals can operate with pacaso they can buy into any neighborhood and flip it into a fractional ownershiptimeshare what’s the big deal well if you think sonoma has changed in the last few years wait until this business model sinks in within a few years our local neighborhoods will be a revolving door of tourists staying in residential homes using our facilities and not paying taxes plus this puts a bigger burden on an already crunched housing marketis this what we want for our community i don’t think it is that’s why i and the residents on my street are fighting this fight it’s about the big picture the long term sonoma is a special place and we have to work hard to keep it that way “community” means different things to different people but once you lose it it’s hard to get back so how can you help put pressure on  district supervisor susan gorin the city council of sonoma and sign our petition on changeorg at chngittxyxcmhxvlbrad daystop sonomans together opposing
