at the time of writing the price of a single bitcoin is £ having dropped more than £ in value and counting from its alltime peak price of £ which occurred earlier this march early  saw progressively higher prices in rapid succession each month seeing the bitcoin price break alltime high records peaking at £ in january and £ in february and £ in march simultaneously the university of cambridge’s bitcoin electricity consumption index estimated annualised electricity demand of the network peaked at a whopping  twh in the same period the present plummeting of the price of bitcoin has plunged cryptocurrency into what longterm investors fear as a bear market and caused a slight dip in the estimated annualised electricity demand to  twh mainly attributable to strong developments in china’s regulatory battle with bitcoin mining occurring last week and yet such volatile behaviour appears to be the norm in the erratic world of cryptocurrencies with the vision of bitcoin as a stateless peertopeer transaction mechanism instead superseded by a speculative and energyexhaustive digital asset seemingly used for no more than the private pursuit of wealth creationto better understand the nuance of bitcoin arguments an appreciation for the concept of security derived from proof of computational work at the heart of blockchain technology’s protocol is needed as outlined in the whitepaper after a fixed number of computational hashes energyintensive mathematical hash functions on the bitcoin network are solved the number of bitcoins which are afforded to the lucky miner is halved with the network mining algorithm set with the target of generating a new block every  minutes the difficulty of solving another hash is automatically adjusted requiring additional computational power to mine new blocks this ultimately encourages exhaustive energy use with the added incentive to develop singular purpose mining hardware in our marketbased economies however in a resource constrained world supposedly set on netzero ambitions one may argue that the resulting drain on key rare earth materials and consequent increases in price of crucial semiconductor devices only prevents the proliferation of lowcarbon technologieswhat is more it is becoming increasingly clear how the environmental costs of bitcoin’s blockchain technology are being socialised for an increasingly concentrated group of large holders commonly referred to as ‘whales’ investors who continue to own most of the digital asset in fact about  of the anonymous ownership accounts that can be tracked on the cryptocurrency’s blockchain control  of the digital asset in addition since bitcoin’s whitepaper highlights the requirement for total transparency ensuring anyone on the network can see their entire transaction history cryptocurrency ‘mixing’ services have prevailed ensuring the ability to obfuscate your cryptowallet’s address in the blockchain a major study released last may found that the value of the amount of bitcoin being transferred between darknet entities and crypto mixers saw a ‘staggering spike’ compared to  of the previous year indicative of the growing utility of bitcoin for illicit practicedespite these significant environmental and social costs the bitcoin clean energy initiative bcei released last month has received public support from high profile figures such as jack dorsey and elon musk the bcei whitepaper asserts that the cryptocurrency could instead accelerate the energy transition claiming the bitcoin network is capable of being leveraged as a unique buyer of clean energy this instead posits the bitcoin mining apparatus as a flexible and interruptible load one which can reduce grid congestion through quickly reducing electricity demand within a variable response time this interesting concept may also function to drive down costs associated with operating battery storage and solar farms if the energy system is coupled with mining hardware the system could assess whether it is more profitable to store energy in the battery or to mine bitcoin based on trailing profitability levelsthe immense and growing electricity consumption of bitcoin deeply implicates it in the energy transition with competing pathways for the digital currency being offered by a variety of powerful entrenched actors however with emissions already rebounding from ’s pandemic supply and demand shocks and last week’s iea netzero  roadmap further reiterating the immense emissions reduction potential from behaviour change policymakers should deeply question the rationality of remaining complicit regarding the regulation of future energyintensive proofofwork blockchain technologies
