more than  of users dont know if their mobile wallet is potentially compromised now theres an app for thata computer science engineer at michigan state university has a word of advice for the millions of bitcoin owners who use smartphone apps to manage their cryptocurrency dont or at least be careful researchers from msu are developing a mobile app to act as a safeguard for popular but vulnerable wallet applications used to manage cryptocurrencymore and more people are using bitcoin wallet apps on their smartphones said guanhua tu an assistant professor in msus college of engineering who works in the department of computer science and engineering but these applications have vulnerabilitiessmartphone wallet apps make it easy to buy and trade cryptocurrency a relatively new digital currency that can be challenging to understand in just about every way except one its very clearly valuable bitcoin was the most valuable cryptocurrency at the time of writing with one bitcoin being worth more than but tu and his team are uncovering vulnerabilities that can put a users money and personal information at risk the good news is that the team is also helping users better protect themselves by raising awareness about these security issues and developing an app that addresses those vulnerabilitiesthe researchers showcased that app  the bitcoin security rectifier  in a paper published for the association for computing machinerys conference on data and application security and privacy in terms of raising awareness tu wants to help wallet users understand that these apps can leave them vulnerable by violating one of bitcoins central principles something called decentralizationbitcoin is a currency thats not tied to any central bank or government theres also no central computer server that stores all the information about bitcoin accounts such as who owns how muchthere are some apps that violate this decentralized principle tu said the apps are developed by third parties and they can let their wallet app connect with their proprietary server that then connects to bitcoinin essence bitcoin security rectifier can introduce a middleman that bitcoin omits by design users often dont know this and app developers arent necessarily forthcoming with the informationmore than  of users are unaware of whether their wallet is violating this decentralized design principle based on the results of a user study tu said and if an app violates this principle it can be a huge security risk for the user for example it can open the door for an unscrupulous app developer to simply take a users bitcointu said that the best way users can safeguard themselves is to not use a smartphone wallet app developed by untrusted developers he instead encourages users to manage their bitcoin using a computer  not a smartphone  and resources found on bitcoins official website bitcoinorg for example the site can help users make informed decisions about wallet appsbut even wallets developed by reputable sources may not be completely safe which is where the new app comes inmost smartphone programs are written in a programming language called java bitcoin wallet apps make use of a java code library known bitcoinj pronounced bitcoin jay the library itself has vulnerabilities that cybercriminals could attack as the team demonstrated in its recent paperthese attacks can have a variety of consequences including compromising a users personal information for example they can help an attacker deduce all the bitcoin addresses that wallet users have used to send or receive bitcoin attacks can also send loads of unwanted data to a user draining batteries and potentially resulting in hefty phone billstus app is designed to run at the same time on the same phone as a wallet where it monitors for signs of such intrusions the app alerts users when an attack is happening and provides remedies based on the type of attack tu said for example the app can add noise to outgoing bitcoin messages to prevent a thief from getting accurate informationthe goal is that youll be able to download our tool and be free from these attacks tu saidthe team is currently developing the app for android phones and plans to have it available for download in the google play app store in the coming months theres currently no timetable for an iphone app because of the additional challenges and restrictions posed by ios tu saidin the meantime though tu emphasized that the best way users can protect themselves from the insecurities of a smartphone bitcoin wallet is simply by not using one unless the developer is trustedthe main thing that i want to share is that if you do not know your smartphone wallet applications well it is better not to use them since any developer  malicious or benign  can upload their wallet apps to google play or apple app store he saidalso collaborating on this project were msus professor li xiao as well as phd students yiwen hu and sihan wang all from the department of computer science and engineering this work was funded in part by the national science foundation
