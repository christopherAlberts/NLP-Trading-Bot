it has been a big year for cryptocurrency bitcoin is worth six times what it was  months ago and the joke currency dogecoin has seen a hundredfold increase in price a boom in “nonfungible tokens” or nfts – tradable tokens based on the same technology as cryptocurrency – is transforming the art marketwith this growth has come renewed scrutiny with critics attacking bitcoin in particular as a speculative bubble that uses vast amounts of electricity and produces no real valuea new cryptocurrency called chia which has just begun trading sets out to remedy these flaws while upholding cryptocurrency’s promise of a secure decentralised form of paymentchia is the brainchild of bram cohen who invented the bittorrent peertopeer filesharing system he claims it will be more reliable than other cryptocurrencies and more environmentally friendly toowhat is cryptocurrencyunlike traditional currencies such as the dollar or euro which are issued by central banks and rely on trust in governments cryptocurrencies rely on a decentralised database called a blockchain secured by sophisticated cryptographic toolsthe first cryptocurrency was bitcoin released in  and today there are at least  cryptocurrencies available bitcoin is still by far the biggest the total value of all bitcoin now in existence is some  trillionread more demystifying the blockchain a basic user guidedespite this booming popularity very few retailers accept cryptocurrency as paymentgovernments around the world are also exploring digital currencies the bank of england is hiring a dedicated team to explore the possibilities in this area while the australian stock exchange is reviewing applications for a cryptocurrencybased exchangetraded fund germany is one of the frontrunners in embracing crypto and is heavily investing in blockchain solutions for institutional investmenthow is chia different from bitcoinbitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies use a system in which currency is created or “mined” using computers to solve mathematical puzzles these are known as “proof of work” systems — solving the puzzle is proof that your computer has done a certain amount of workread more the utopian currency bitcoin is a potentially catastrophic energy guzzlerdoing this work takes specialised hardware and lots of energy bitcoin mining has helped create shortages of graphics processors and by some estimates it is more energyintensive than copper mining and uses more electricity than some entire countrieschia runs on a system that should use less energy called “proof of space and time” in this system users need to show they have reserved a specific amount of hard drive space at a precise timeso chia won’t use huge amounts of electricity and won’t see miners buying up every graphics card in sight but the requirement for hard drive storage space may lead to other drawbackshard drive price surgeeven before its official launch chia has used more than an exabyte of data storage that’s the equivalent of about a million of the  terabyte hard drives you might find in an average desktop computeraccording to the south china morning post hard drive prices in china have begun to soar as chia miners stockpile storage the price of  drives has increased by  since chia was announced in february this year and most professionalquality hard drives with more than  terabytes of capacity are sold outvietnam is also seeing hard drive shortages as a result of china’s chia crazeshutterstockwe may well see similar effects in other countries in the not too distant future at present chia lacks the name recognition and celebrity endorsements that have helped the likes of bitcoin and dogecoin to soar but it has a clear cost advantagewe can expect cryptocurrency miners will be inclined to try chia as a cheaper option than established cryptocurrencies eventually hard drive manufacturers may also revise their prices to increase their own revenuetime will tell how chia ends up performing on the market if it takes off we can expect a boom in hard drive prices but on the flipside it might also mean graphics processor prices come back down
