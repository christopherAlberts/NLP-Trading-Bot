the following is a republishing of hass mccook’s “comparing bitcoin’s environmental impact…” which was first published herenote the methodology and underlying figures specifically emission rates for gold and banking mentioned throughout are generally derived from my  and  works the  work is available as an easiertodigest  medium series herebitcoin’s energy consumption and environmental impact are commented on very regularly but ultimately they are rarely understood the majority of arguments stem from comparisons of bitcoin’s electricity use to that of particular countries or some other applestooranges comparison critics can’t even separate “energy use” from “electricity use”energy  electricity  heating  transportover  billion people have no access to the electrical grid but still have access to energy via physical fuels just like they don’t need the grid to survive neither do bitcoin miners many of whom are now using flared methane in remote oil fields to mine bitcoin of the  twh of energy generated worldwide each year  twh is lost to inefficiency and only  twh is generated by electrical grids bitcoin consumes around  twh a mere  of the energy wasted each year or  of the world’s grid electricity representing less than  of human energy production pick your poison with the framingalthough bitcoin’s energy use is trivial to define and calculate this is not the case for the industries with which bitcoin is regularly compared where does the environmental impact of the gold industry end does it end with the deep gashes in the earth that opencut gold mines leave that are so massive they can be seen from outer space do we also factor in the electricity costs of all of the world’s jewelry shops and gold dealers furthermore what about the environmental impact of the banking system does it include all of the bank buildings atms and cotton plastic and metal used to manufacture notes coins and cards or does banking’s impact include the money printing and relentless pursuit of profit at all costs that has spurred untethered consumerism and environmental destruction how do we classify the ability to print money out of thin air so that trillions can be spent on statesanctioned mass murder defining the scope of environmental impact can get out of hand quickly and emotionallythe next issue is framing there has been a dangerous conflation between energy use and pollution to return to the example of gold companies like dell are now aiming to use  recycled gold in their computer chipsets as according to research commissioned by them it is “at least  cleaner” than physical mining it is “cleaner” because recycling gold avoids the use of trillions of gallons of water and the creation of mountains of waste rock that being said recycling gold consumes more electricity than mining it so is recycling “dirtier” than mining just because more  is emitted this is laughable further gold is not mined with an electric caterpillar  bulldozer gold recycling is largely a griddependent process as the energy grid gets cleaner and becomes emissionless so will gold recycling for the most part this is also true for bitcoin you can expect bitcoin’s energy use to trend towards infinity in the long term and its environmental impact should trend towards zeroso what do the actual numbers look like although i have outlined why such comparisons are disingenuous i present the following analysis which is based on my works from  and  and indexed to today’s numbersgoldin   tons of gold were mined and  tons of gold were recycled according to “goldorg” according to dell each kilogram of mined gold produces  tons of  and uses  mwh of energy but they omit the energy needed for further refinement of the gold because of data limitations a new study from depaul university suggests that this number should be closer to  tons of  for jewelry which accounts for roughly  of global gold demand it is assumed that refinement uses a similar amount of power to recycling therefore a total of  mwh is used for the mining and refinement of each gram of gold used in jewelry each kilogram of recycled gold produces  tons of  and uses  mwh of energy this brings the gold mining industry’s  total to  twh of energy used and  mt of  produced if we use the depaul study’s numbers and account for  tons of jewelrybankingin  i calculated a figure of  twh of energy used by the banking system’s branches and atms in addition to cotton plastic and metal for manufacture of notes and coins without too much wizardry we can conservatively assume an increase of – per year and we can therefore round up our figure to  twh of energy consumed and about  mt of  produced“there are infinite emissions at the federal reserve” — neel kashkariimage sourcebitcoini am very comfortable using the cambridge bitcoin electricity consumption index cbeci as their methodology mirrors mine from  and  according to the cbeci bitcoin uses  twh of energy per year the proportion of renewables used is unknowable but basic economics dictates that miners will continue to chase the cheapest power available which is increasingly becoming renewable bitcoin could be running on a majority combination of stranded waste and renewable energy by the end of the decade using the current global average grid figure of about  tons of  per kwh of electricity produced bitcoin mining emits  mt of  annuallyalthough the comparisons are not likeforlike and with only bitcoin’s scope of energy use and emissions being  defined we can say that bitcoin consumesemits less than half of what the gold mining industry does and less than onefifth of what bank branches and atms doenergy used twh tonnes  produced gold mining   million gold jewelry   million gold recycling   million paper currency and minting   million bank branches and atms   million bitcoin mining   millioni know how much everyone loves this tablethis is a guest post by hass mccook opinions expressed are entirely
