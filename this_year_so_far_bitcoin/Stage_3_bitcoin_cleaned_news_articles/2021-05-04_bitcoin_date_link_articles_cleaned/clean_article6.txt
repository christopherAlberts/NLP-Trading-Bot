cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are becoming increasingly popular at first glance they have many advantages transactions are usually anonymous fast and inexpensive but sometimes there are problems with them in certain situations fraud is possible users can discover information about other users that should be kept secret and sometimes delays occurthe research unit security and privacy at tu wien lukas aumayr and his supervisor prof matteo maffei in collaboration with the imdea software institute prof pedro morenosanchez previously postdoc at tu wien and the purdue university prof aniket kate analyzed these problems and developed an improved protocol it has now been published and will be presented this year at the usenix security symposium  one of the big four it security conferences worldwide which are considered very prestigiousthe bottleneck of bitcoinit has long been known that bitcoin and other blockchain technologies have a scalability problem there can only be a maximum of ten transactions per second says lukas aumayr of the security and privacy research unit at tu wien thats very few compared to credit card companies for example which perform tens of thousands of transactions per second worldwidean approach to solve this problem is the lightning network  an additional network of payment channels between blockchain users for example if two people want to process many transactions in a short period of time they can exchange payments directly between each other in this way without each individual transaction being published on the blockchain only at the beginning and end of this series of transactions is there an official entry in the blockchainthese side branches of the blockchain can also be made relatively complicated with chains of multiple users problems can arise in the process says lukas aumayr in certain cases users can then get hold of data about other users in addition everyone in this chain has to contribute a certain amount of money which is locked as collateral sometimes a transaction fails and then a lot of money can remain locked for a relatively long time  the more people involved the longermathematically ruling out vulnerabilitiesthe research team at tu wien analyzed how this transaction protocol can be improved and developed an alternative construction you can analyze the security of such protocols using formal methods so we can mathematically prove that our new protocol does not allow certain errors and problems in any situation says aumayrthis makes it possible to rule out very specific securitycritical attacks that were previously possible and also to prevent longterm money blocking previously two rounds of communication were necessary in the first round the money is locked in the second round it is released  or refunded if there were problems that could mean an extra day of delay for each user in that chain with our protocol the communication chain only has to be run through once explains lukas aumayrsimulation proves practicalityhowever it is not only the fundamental logical structure of the new protocol that is important but also its practicality therefore the team simulated in a payment channel network how the new technology behaves compared to the previous lightning network the advantages of the new protocol became particularly apparent depending on the situation such as whether or not there are attacks and fraud attempts the new protocol results in a factor of  to  fewer failed transactions than with the conventional lightning networkthe tu wien team is already in contact with the lightning networks development organizations of course we hope that our technology will be quickly deployed or at least offered as a more secure alternative to the current technology says lukas aumayr technically this could be implemented immediatelycontactlukas aumayrforschungsbereich „security and privacyinstitut für logic and computationtu wienfavoritenstraße   wien österreich   lukasaumayrtuwienacat
