tractionmany digital currencies have distinct use cases and you should understand the value proposition of a potential investment before committing capital grayscale investments ceo michael sonnenshein said in an emailfor novice crypto investors its probably best to start with the larger more established options  such as bitcoin and ethereum while still highly volatile the regulatory framework around them is clearer than with other tokens which could help temper future riskbitcoin is also the most liquid cryptocurrency which should make it easier for investors to buy and sell with relative ease compared to smaller more niche coins with less demand farrokhnia saidafter starting with the usual suspects panxoras smith said invvestors should do some research then maybe branch out

buzzing about it fomo is not a good investment strategy instead many recommend the dollar cost averaging tactic which entails buying smaller amounts at regular intervals over a set period of timedollar cost averaging is a great tactic for investors who want to invest and hold digital currencies over the long term smith saidhow risky is it reallycryptocurrency is still quite risky compared with most other asset classesfor an average investor with a few thousand dollars of savings this may not be the best domain to invest your money farrokhnia saidthe price of most mainstream cryptocurrencies isnt pegged to something specific and observable in the way that stock prices typically fluctuate with the fundamental performance of a company that can make it hard to understand or predict the current or future trajectory of a digital coinfor this reason experts recommend allocating only a small portion of your total investment portfolio if any to cryptobut for some the higher risk could be attractive because it may mean higher rewardthe volatility inherent in the asset class makes crypto a riskier asset than most equities but it comes with higher potential upside many digital currencies including bitcoin offer superior riskadjusted returns over time grayscales sonnenshein said he added bitcoin may not be for everyone but everyone should at least consider it
