in modern economic terms money is often defined as a store of value measure of transactions unit of account and deferred exchange standard however monetary transactions have a longdisputed history concerning their originthroughout our civilisation we have read that the barter system was used as a means of a transaction however with size scope and measure of transactions increasing the barter system was inadequate and subsequently unreliable as the scope of goods transacted increased it became difficult to ascertain the actual barter value of each product leading to a uniform widely accepted mechanism to conduct trade and commercekingdoms in the past often used precious metal coins of varied compositions as demonstrators of the economic prosperity of their realms currency as we know it today ie paper currency has its origins in china china through its ancient silk road was a major global player in trade and commercetraders realised that carrying coins was impractical especially for significant transactions therefore they started keeping coins with a group of select individuals and began issuing paper notes backed by these coins as means of valuethe same principle is applied today concerning modernday currencies also known as fiat currencies backed by sovereign governments that provide uniformity as a store of value to various goods and services internationally there is a basket of currencies that are used to carry out international trade and commercealthough the aftermath of the  global financial crisis is a new type of independent means of the transaction came into existence ie cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are a form of digital money there are no actual bitcoins instead balances are held on a decentralised ledger based on blockchain technology and accessible to everyone both bitcoin transactions are verified using a massive amount of computing capacity since bitcoins are not circulated or backed by banks or states they are useless as resourcesconcerns have been raised regarding the actual value of these cryptocurrencies as their availability is scarce resulting in unnecessary speculations in terms of their valuations there is a concern that some tangible assets do not back cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin compared to fiat currencieshowever according to some studies researchers have argued that the expense of manufacturing a bitcoin which consumes a growing amount of electricity is closely related to its stock price despite concerns over fair value many companies and organisations have started accepting cryptocurrency as a means of payment for the purchase of goods and services on their respective platforms according to estimates there are roughly around over  different forms of cryptocurrencies that are in use across the world most common among them are bitcoin etherium and recent frenzy after elon musk and mark cuban’s tweets dogecoinrecent trends and the popularity of cryptocurrencies suggest that even sovereign nations may venture into the realm of digital currencies again china has taken the lead and others are exploring means to follow suit the big difference would be that digital currencies issued by sovereign countries would be like a digital version of their fiat currency which would lead to better scrutiny and regulation of this financial space bringing in muchneeded uniformity and parity however there are risks involved traditional commercial banks would be deprived of a reliable source of funds such as retail deposits clients would seek the stability of a central bankguaranteed account in the case of a recession or any other financial crisis exposing them to the risk of running on their coffers another factor favouring digital currencies backed by central banks would be the price volatility of private crypto’s the valuation of private cryptocurrencies fluctuates dramatically over brief periods a central bank digital currency would be considered far safer than cryptocurrencywhen businesses and consumers claim to be more concerned with climate change and sustainability their largescale endeavours into the realm of cryptocurrency may be at odds with their ecofriendly claims for instance tesla has spent more than  billion of its balance sheet in bitcoin a firm whose entire premise is to help mitigate climate change by lower carbon emissions what impact does its bitcoin assets have on its longterm viability scoreaccording to recent reports the annual carbon emissions from mining bitcoin and processing its transactions equal to the amount of electricity generated by the whole country of new zealand or argentina in an interview recently bill gates said “bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind and so it’s not a great climate thing”according to the bitcoin energy consumption index one bitcoin transaction is “equivalent to the carbon footprint of  visa transactions or  hours of watching youtube” as bitcoin becomes more prevalent in circulation energy consumption for its generation and transaction processing is expected to result in a significant rise in global temperatures making it impossible for organisations and countries to meet their climate change commitmentscryptocurrency trading has resulted in an impact on pricing in major energy and utility markets according to a  report by academics from dublin city university trinity college dublin and the university of southamptonif we look at the lifecycle costs of the whole cryptomining process serious questions can be raised concerning their longterm viability as private corporations are being taxed for carbon emissions the day is not far when similar calls for a carbon tax on crypto mining would be heard
