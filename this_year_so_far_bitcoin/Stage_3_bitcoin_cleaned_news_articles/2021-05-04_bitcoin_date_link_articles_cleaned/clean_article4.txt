after charlie munger said bitcoin cryptobtc is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization at the recent berkshire hathaway nysebrka nysebrkb annual meeting some may get the idea that all value investors must hate the worlds largest cryptocurrency well as in everything related to the market the bitcoin debate is not so cut and dried even among famous value investorsfor instance bill miller a very successful value investor and buffett acolyte is a bitcoin bull miller invested in bitcoin in his fund years ago before being forced to spin out his bitcoin holdings into a separate account for investors miller also invested his personal money in bitcoin and is now a bitcoin billionaire after having purchased the cryptocurrency back in  at an average price around  per share which he continues to holdwhile not as famous as buffett and munger miller became famous in the  and early  after beating the market for  consecutive years when he ran the legg mason value trust he did go on to make a big mistake during the great financial crisis of  losing  that year yet a recent profile in barrons showed miller is back with his current fund the miller opportunity trust in the top  of its peers over the past one three five and  periodsfor those interested in bitcoin but unsure if its right for them you can probably find the best arguments on both sides of the bitcoin debate from buffett and miller who share two of the greatest investing track records of all timehere are their takes on bitcoins intrinsic value which is predicated on its utility as a store of value medium of exchange and hedge against inflationbuffett v miller on bitcoins uses and intrinsic valuebuffett has commented on bitcoins value or lack thereof on numerous occasions in  he saidts ingenious and blockchain is important but bitcoin has no unique value at all it doesnt produce anything you can stare at it all day and no little bitcoins come our or anything like that its a delusion basicallyfollowers of buffett know he values all financial assets based on the wealth they produce for bitcoin and other types of commodities without high industrial value buffett cant escape the fact that these assets dont actually produce anything in  years there will still only be  million bitcoinsmeanwhile miller believes bitcoin is closest in function and value to digital gold in that it is a store of value and possible hedge against inflation and that bitcoin is superior as a better medium of exchange so why shouldnt bitcoin be at least as valuable as gold which is still  times the value of bitcoin heres what he saidmany of the larger owners of bitcoin say the best way to think about it is as digital gold gold is analog bitcoin is digital its far superior to gold as a store of value not just because its gone up  a year for  years but because you cant flee your country with millions of dollars worth of gold as its bulky and hard to divide whereas you can send bitcoin anywhere in a fraction of a second at very low cost and its almost infinitely divisible the best estimates ive seen are that theres about  trillion of gold value in the world some in jewelry some in central banks some in things like etfs bitcoins market cap is around  trillion im highly confident that bitcoin can go up  times under certain reasonably assumed conditionsâ€”namely it can be as valuable as goldfor the record buffett is not the biggest fan of gold either and has said similar things about gold as he has about bitcoin he believes its of limited utility notes that isnt used in many industrial applications and disagrees that its a good store of value or mode of exchange all of those factors will drive the price for bitcoin so lets investigate each potential use caseon bitcoins utility as a medium of exchangewhile gold cant really be used as an efficient medium of exchange these days more and more companies are allowing for you to pay for things with bitcoin in fact tesla nasdaqtsla just recently allowed customers to pay for cars with bitcoin as of the end of marchof course as a medium of exchange bitcoin is also up against the leading credit and debit card networks checks and cash buffett touched on bitcoins difficult competition years agoits a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that a check is a way of transmitting money too are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money i hope bitcoin becomes a better way of doing it but you can replicate it a bunch of different waysunsurprisingly miller was asked about that comment specifically and replied if there were  million checks in the world and thats all there were checks would be very very valuablemiller here is referring to the limit of  million bitcoins which is a limit put on the bitcoin blockchain network by its inventor satoshi nakamoto this is true and the scarcity value may make bitcoin like an expensive check but does that make it a better mode of exchangeback in  miller did write that there are possible scenarios in which bitcoin may be a better transaction medium that credit card networks because of lower friction and coststhe open ledger combined with the complexity of transaction data makes bitcoin a very secure method of payment relative to someones credit card which relies upon one simple set of numbers to effect many transactions one of bitcoins biggest advantages over other payment networks like visa and mastercard is minimal transaction fees while other payment networks typically charge the greater of  and  bitcoins transaction fee tends to be a negligible fraction of the transaction if any at all lower transaction fees not only enable buyers and sellers to transact at prices that are better for both parties but they could enable micropayments in markets that are not otherwise compatible with a  surcharge on lowprice lowmargin goods and servicesone pitfall is that bitcoin may be too good a medium of exchange so much so that it becomes a preferred solution for kidnappers and extortionists displacing suitcases full of cash this is one of the moral concerns munger has brought up while extortion and kidnapping existed before bitcoin its possible that bitcoin could make things marginally easier for some types of nefarious activitiesas with investing in things like sugary drinks oil cigarettes gambling or alcohol companies every investor needs to draw his or her own moral lines when investing taking into account of costs and benefits each security brings to the world without judging one way or another on this matter for the purposes of this debate lets continue focusing on bitcoins merits and shortfalls as a financial assetbitcoin as a store of valuebuffett has also dismissed the argument that bitcoin is a good store of value saying in its not a currency it does not meet the test of a currency i wouldnt be surprised if its not around in  or  years it is not a durable means of exchange its not a store of value its been a very speculative kind of buck rogerstype thing and people buy and sell them because they hope they go up or down just like they did with tulip bulbs a long time agoharking back to tulipmania of  holland buffett is basically saying bitcoin is only as valuable as tulips  in other words however much someone is willing to pay its likely that the inherent lack of government backing and high volatility make bitcoin a bad store of value and medium of exchange for buffetthowever millers son bill miller iv who runs is own income fund and shares his fathers views on bitcoin predicts that bitcoins volatility should decrease over time as the price runs higher which will improve its standing as a viable means of exchange and store of valuewhen bitcoins volatility approaches that of treasuries its market cap and price per bitcoin will be immensely higher and leave little room for excess return at that point one could imagine bitcoin transitioning to become a more commonly used medium of exchangethis may seem like circular logic bitcoin will be worth a lot as a medium of exchange when it becomes less volatile which will only happen after its price increases a lot and yet yes thats pretty much what miller believesfollowing on that topic in a recent interview miller claimed that bitcoins recent rise had made it less risky not more it gets less risky the higher it goes which is the opposite of most stocks miller saidin millers mind the recent rise in bitcoins price is validation of institutional demand and the mutual agreement across institutions that bitcoin is the de facto cryptocurrency for the world given that institutions and leading companies are now buying bitcoin in their treasuries with some corporate cash that validates bitcoins inherent value if that adoption continues demand should far outstrip the supply of bitcoin for some time to come miller goes onthe supply grew  last year its growing  this year is demand growing faster or slower than  well morgan stanley nysems is going to make bitcoin available to their clients goldman sachs nysegs is going to make it available to their clients every big bank will do so theres bitcoin exchangetraded funds in canada and brazil and about five of them have filed in the us theres an estimated  million millionaires in the world if each of them wanted to own one bitcoin they couldnt  there are only  million of them and how many hundreds of billions of dollars of cash is sitting on company balance sheets microstrategy nasdaqmstr famously put all of its cash in bitcoin tesla put cash in bitcoin but the adoption rounds to zero its that asymmetry between supply and demand that is leading to whats going onbuffett isnt convinced bitcoin will last and attributes its recent adoption by banks as no better than banks speculating on housing during the great financial crises or in tulips during the tulip bubble of  holland it will feed on itself for a while and sometimes for a long while and sometimes to extraordinary numbers but they come to bad endings and cryptocurrencies will come to bad endingswhats odd here is that buffett and miller both see bitcoin in a similar way yet have opposite takes on it buffett sees the cryptocurrency as having value only inasmuch that people are willing to believe it which makes it risky and of no real worth meanwhile miller sees current demand so far outstripping supply that it doesnt really matter what utility bitcoin will ultimately have its going higher regardless because institutions have decided its worth somethingon bitcoin as a good hedge against inflation and governmentbacked currencyone of the more intellectual arguments for bitcoin is that its a hedge against the fall of major governments and their currencies a scenario that could lead to hyperinflation with the us running up massive debts and increasing the money supply to cope with recent crises its a concern on many investors minds starting with the positive side here miller claims bitcoin is an effective hedge against a hyperinflationary scenariobitcoin is the solution to a problem thats bedeviled economies since there were economies which is government monopoly over the money supply and the banking systems leading to serial defaults confiscation with nationalization inflation and  money growth even in the us bitcoin protects you from all of those thingsthis argument probably makes the most sense for bitcoin as an intrinsically valuable financial asset assuming bitcoin has in fact achieved a firstmover advantage and the network effect of being the worlds centralized digital currency and not other cryptos then it may very well function as a more efficient form of goldbut again remember that buffett doesnt have much affection for gold even as an inflation hedge so to have a new technology that at its best may be a new digital form of gold isnt so appetizing on the topic of golds role as a hedge on inflation buffett wrote in his  letter to shareholdersthe second major category of investments involves assets that will never produce anything but that are purchased in the buyers hope that someone else  who also knows that the assets will be forever unproductive  will pay more for them in the future tulips of all things briefly became a favorite of such buyers in the  century  the major asset in this category is gold currently a huge favorite of investors who fear almost all other assets especially paper money of whose value as noted they are right to be fearful  during the past decade that belief has proved correct beyond that the rising price has on its own generated additional buying enthusiasm attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis as bandwagon investors join any party they create their own truth  for a whilebuffett then notes that internet stocks in the late  and housing in the  were examples of logical ideas that turned into bubbles before collapsing and the same could have been written about bitcoin todayso what would buffett prefer to own as a hedge against inflation instead of gold he prefers stocks of productive businesses that have pricing power and dont require much capital investment buffett went on to cite berkshire holdings cocacola and sees candies as examples of assets that are good inflation hedges since they can raise prices and customers are likely to accept them while neither is burdened with heavy capital coststhe verdictthe final verdict has not yet been rendered on bitcoin and its unclear whether buffett or miller will be proved right in fact they both could be right bitcoin could very well surge to or beyond the price of gold and then crash or even become worthless later onthese are two of the smartest investors on the planet articulating both sides of the bitcoin argument so investors will have to figure if the new financial currency is within their risk and moral toleranceregardless of where you come down one thing i would recommend is not putting a huge proportion of ones net worth in bitcoin whether bitcoin is a winner or a loser it appears to be an allornothing type of bet as they say regarding investments in highrisk highupside assets if it goes up a lot you dont need much and if it goes to zero you wont want much
