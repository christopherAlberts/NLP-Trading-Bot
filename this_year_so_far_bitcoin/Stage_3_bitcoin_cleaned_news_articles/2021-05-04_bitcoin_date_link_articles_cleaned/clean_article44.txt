need to account for how market makers can deliver the securities into a digital wallet on their behalf said frank koudelka senior vicepresident and global etf product specialist at state streetthe bostonbased custodian has accommodated this by providing a reference number for each transaction that notes on whose behalf the market maker is delivering the cryptocurrency koudelka said the company

fund accounting fund administration” waldron noted “it was a good testing ground to then step into the registered fund space and make sure we have that controlbased infrastructure”some of the tweaks were technical such as ensuring its fund accounting system could reconcile cryptocurrency valuations that are far more precise than traditional fund net asset values they also worked to make sure that their antimoney laundering and knowyourcustomer compliance control processes will work in a world where it can be hard to verify the identity of digital wallet ownersbut one area where crypto

holding cryptocurrencies alongside more traditional assets in a multiasset portfolious bank has a custody arm but has chosen to partner with crypto experts to custody bitcoin for etfs waldron said she
