what’s been behind the recent dips in the price of bitcoin and what might the future potentially holdnavigating the stormy seas of the bitcoin markets can be a challenge luckily bitcoin uses a publicly available blockchain that contains valuable information about all transactions that were ever made on the network by combining this onchain data with other price and market data bitcoin holders are more equipped to understand why its markets behave the way that they do giving them tools to make more informed decisions or the confidence needed to keep sailing this article is the fifth installment in a series of monthly market analyses that started out as a twitter thread that was transformed into this article upon requestthis bitcoin market analysis looks at three overarching questionswhy did we dip again is there still demand is there still room for growthbefore we dive into those questions lets first have a look at the price chart figure  bitcoin started the month strong rallying to a new alltime high at  but then dropped to  where it found a lot of confluence for support eg a key fibonacci level a large volume in the utxo realized price distribution and large whale inflowsupon writing my monthly market analyses i noticed a trend i am writing about a price dip that happened near the end of the month william clemente iii has recently noticed that same pattern figure figure  a tweet by william clemente iii image source why did we dip againbased on responses on twitter an explanation for this phenomenon should be sought in the options markets as explained here this is related to something called “max pain” which is essentially the art of making one’s trading counterparty suffer the most to reach optimal personal profitability after the bitcoin price had rapidly risen in late  an increasing number of options traders were expecting continued price growth this created a scenario in which it became profitable to take the other side of this trade if price indeed went downthe rapid bitcoin price growth is particularly visible in the bitcoin price temperature bpt as can be seen in the second chart in figure  temperatures rose at a much faster pace so far this cycle orange line in comparison to the previous one yellow line as a result price reached temperatures of around six orange line in the other charts in figure  at an earlier posthalving date than during the  bull run therefore some exhaustion of price could be expected around these price levelsfigure  the bitcoin price temperature bpt and bpt bands image sourcesimilarly to the options markets an increasing number of futures market participants became excited about bitcoin’s prospects and took leveraged bets at an increasing rate causing open interest on futures to skyrocket figure  not just the bitcoin price and its temperature needed to cool off — so did the leverage in the futures marketsfigure  open interest in futures markets on all exchanges chart sourcethe amount of pain of those futures traders that massively went long on leverage during this parabolic rise is visualized in the long liquidations chart in figure  a lesson can be learned here when everyone and their mother is going leveraged long it pays to be short — especially if you are a whale that can help push the price downfigure  long liquidations in usd on all exchanges chart sourcethe latter is exactly what happened the most recent bitcoin dip started with a large somewhat old august  whale that took a profit  who was followed up by a younger december  whale that also took a profit  that cascaded all the way down to some newbie whales  month old that even ended up selling at a loss i wrote a twitter thread about this of which the first four tweets are summarized in the gallery showing figure  gallery  imagesfigure  the first four tweets of a twitter thread on whale profittaking sourcethe thread concluded with a chart of the spent output profit ratio sopr that had just reset back to one figure  this means that on average the bitcoins that were last sold and moved onchain were neither in profit nor at a loss — an indication that market participants are no longer actively taking profits which is a good sign during a consolidating price dipfigure  spent output profit ratio soprchart sourcearound that same time the bitcoin price was touching the network value to transaction nvt ratio price model that had worked as a support during the previous bull runs figure figure  multiple bitcoin price models by willy woo including the nvt price blue line chart sourcethat week not just the bitcoin price dipped so did its hash rate likely thanks to a governmentinstituted power outage in china this drop caused the hash ribbons to compress creating a miner capitulation signal on the hash ribbon indicator as soon as the hash rate starts to recover the indicator then gives a “buy” signal blue dots in figure  that can soon be expected to occur on the bitcoin price although it is unclear if the unique circumstances of this specific hash rate drop invalidate the signal its miner capitulation and buy signals have historically been very good opportunities to buy bitcoinfigure  the bitcoin price and charles edwards hash ribbon indicator chart via tradingviewsince then the bitcoin price bounced back resiliently even closing the month at  which is barely even a red candle  what is encouraging is that this rise was accompanied by some very negative net flows on spot exchanges figure  possibly indicating continued institutional interest in the assetfigure  spot exchanges netflow chart sourceperhaps an even more comforting thought is that this latest price rise was not accompanied by a rise in funding rates figure  which is a sign that it was primarily spotmarkets driven and more likely to be sustainable this means that the traders that irresponsibly leveraged long during the run up and were rekt are now either on the sidelines or learned their lesson and bought spot bitcoin without leveragefigure  funding rates on all exchanges chart sourceto gauge the current market sentiment i held a twitter poll last week although the sample size was modest the results were quite clear figure  respondents were indifferent shortterm but very much bullish on bitcoin mid to longtermfigure  results of a twitter market sentiment poll on april   poll sourcethe previous  charts showed a clear picture that during the last few months bitcoin markets were overleveraged after a rapid price rise and simply needed a bit of time to cool off causing this consolidation with several dips to get out of a dip you clearly need demand for the asset though which brings us to the second question is there still demand for bitcointo assess this we will have a look at the trends in a number of different metrics perhaps the exchange balances chart that has been in an incredible downtrend since the march  –related market panic is the most famous figure  shows that although that downtrend has had a few minor bumps along the way its larger trend is still intactfigure  bitcoin balances on exchanges chart sourcea similar pattern can be witnessed in the balances of overthecounter otc trading desks figure  the supply shortage is real there is a decreasing amount of bitcoin that actively circulates on the marketsfigure  bitcoin balances on otc desks via lex moskovski chart sourcethat trend becomes even clearer when you see that the liquid market supply has decreased on a daily basis all year so far top chart in figure  and thus the illiquid supply — the coins in the hands of holders with no history of selling — keeps growing bottom chart in figure figure  the daily liquid supply change  and illiquid supply growth  via william clemente iii chart sourcea similar pattern can be witnessed when looking at miner positions miners were taking profits in january but have stopped doing so since late march and have been accumulating bitcoin ever since figure figure  miner net position change via william clemente iiichart sourceif there is an increasing supply shortage on the markets and newly created coins are not coming to market to fill it who willthe answer is clear existing coins need to become available to the market to meet the new demand the problem is that longterm holders are not selling — they are buying figure figure  longterm holder net position change via william clemente iiichart sourcesince neither miners nor longterm holders are selling their bitcoin and balances on exchanges are declining an increasing number of addresses on the bitcoin network is in accumulation mode as can be seen in figure figure  number of accumulation addresses via william clemente iiichart sourcethe steep rise in the number of accumulation addresses is even more encouraging when we consider that the number of new entities coming to the network is also growing at an alltime high figure figure  entities net growth sevenday exponential moving average via william clemente iii chart sourcethe previous charts are all observing historical data but the relatively high stablecoin balances on exchanges in figure  suggests that that there could currently be money waiting on the sidelines ready to buy the next dip — or perhaps fomo in if price runs awayfigure  stablecoin reserves on spot exchanges chart sourcethese charts all suggest that the trends that signaled a high demand for bitcoin in the past are still present is there still room for growthit is hard to predict future demand for any asset but the fact that bitcoin has moved in a very expressive fouryear cycle which i described in detail in this recent bitcoin magazine article means that there is clear cyclical historic data to compare the current cycle withone of these metrics is the marketvaluetorealizedvalue mvrv ratio that compares bitcoin’s current market valuation to the value of all individual unspent transactions on the network at the last time they moved onchain — the realized value like we saw with the bpt before the mvrv zscore reached relatively high levels recently but since then it has dropped because the realized value itself went up figure  the current cycle also did not reach similar mvrv zscore levels as it did during the previous cycles suggesting that if this cycle is like the others there still is room for growthfigure  market value to realized value mvrv zscore chart sourcesimilarly the puell multiple — a metric that quantifies to what extent the daily coin issuance is increased in compared to its oneyear moving average — was also at relatively high levels but recently decreased after the hash rate drop on the network figure figure  the puell multiple chart sourcewhen we shift our attention to the confidence of longterm holders which is captured by the reserve risk the results are less pronounced the reserve risk suggests that while longterm holders have gradually started taking some profits throughout the bull market so far we are only halfway through the cycle in comparison to the previous cycleswhere the reserve risk assesses longterm holder market behavior by looking at the age of the coins that were moved onchain the realized hodl rhodl ratio does so by looking at the age of the longterm holders’ coins that didn’t move onchain figure  the conclusion is similar nonetheless compared to previous cycles a relatively large portion of longterm holders are still keeping their cards against their chests waiting for higher prices to part with their bitcoinfigure  realized hodl ratio chart sourceto close off this analysis we’ll have a look at my halving cycle roadmap chart figure  that combines the bpt bands metric that was introduced earlier with several popular predictive price models by doing so we get a rough idea where the bitcoin price might be heading next — off course assuming that its fouryear cyclicality holds as the bpt recently cooled off toward green the bitcoin price is now lagging behind most of the predictive price models when will it catch upfigure  the bitcoin halving cycle roadmapto finalize this market analysis several conclusions can be summarizedcompared to the previous bull run of  the price increase in this current bull run was relatively steep and intense so some exhaustion could be expected at these levelsthe bitcoin futures markets were overleveraged but now less sothe demand for bitcoin appears to be strong as everunder the assumption of fouryear price cyclicality there is still room for growth left on most onchain market cycle
