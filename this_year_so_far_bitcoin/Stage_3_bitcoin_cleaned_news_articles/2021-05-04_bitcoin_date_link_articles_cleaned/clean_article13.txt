tns — by next year owners of a gasfired power plant on seneca lake hope to be producing enough electricity to power  homesbut much of that electricity won’t turn on lights in living rooms it will instead stay on site at the plant in dresden powering up to  computers that will run  hours a day to snag increasingly rare virtual currency called bitcointhe plant worries climate change activists who say the extraordinary amount of energy consumed in what’s known as bitcoin mining will make it hard for new york to meet its aggressive climate change goals“we’re talking about burning more fossil fuels to make fake money in the middle of climate change which we view as insane” said yvonne taylor vice president of the environmental group seneca lake guardianthe greenidge generation holdings plant is part of a growing trend lucrative cryptocurrency centers gobble up huge amounts of energy so much so that they take over power plants or old factories to use for themselves several have already set up shop in upstate new york where energy is cheap and cold weather reduces the cost of cooling thousands of computer processors each of which emits as much heat as a  hair dryernew york will have to grapple with the surging demand of bitcoin mining if the state expects to slash greenhouse gas emissions said tristan brown a professor of sustainable resources management at suny college of environmental science and forestry“bitcoin does raise some interesting questions” brown said “is this something we necessarily want to have contributing to our electrical demand what type of value does it bring the state economically that’s ultimately what state policy will have to determine”while those questions are being debated legislators in both houses are introducing bills that would impose a threeyear moratorium on cryptocurrency mining“the continued and expanded operation of cryptocurrency mining centers will greatly increase the amount of energy usage” reads the senate bill  sponsored by assemblyman kevin parker dbrooklyn “it is reasonable to believe the associated greenhouse gas emissions will irreparably harm compliance with the climate leadership and community protection act”assemblywoman anna kelles d ithaca plans to introduce the assembly version of the bill this weekthe largest cryptocurrency mining operation in the world is in the former alcoa aluminum smelter in massena according to its owner coinmint a british columbian company filed an application in april to buy a  gas power plant just north of buffalo and turn it into a bitcoin mining operationthis is just the beginning environmental groups earthjustice and the sierra club wrote to new york regulators in early april“the greenidge power plant is one of nearly  power plants in upstate new york with the potential to be converted to fulltime operation for bitcoin mining and other highenergy data tasks” the letter saidthe groups are urging the state to enforce strict environmental standards when the greenidge plant seeks to renew its air permit  which expires in september if the plant meets its capacity of  megawatts the groups said greenidge would pump more than  million tons of climatewarming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere exceeding the limits of the permit the letter saidwithout a thorough review and strong regulations of powerplantsturnedbitcoinmining centers the groups said new york would “face grave challenges” to reduce carbon emissions by  percent by  and  percent by  as called for in the climate leadership and community protection act“the state has established a commitment to its residents to the country to the planet that we have very aggressive goals” kelles said “the question with greenidge is will the way they are going to make money be completely counter to the state’s goal”a spokesman for greenidge michael mckeon said the company meets and will continue to meet all the requirements of its permit from the state department of environmental conservationgreenidge has revived a mothballed power plant and helped the local economy chief executive officer dale irwin said in a statement“we employ dozens of workers compared to two just a few years ago and anticipate creating an additional dozen or more new hightech jobs in just the next several months” he said “we are a business that fully supports our community partners protects our environment and seneca lake and operates in full compliance with all laws environmental permits and ordinances”mckeon said that  of the plant’s power is distributed to the grid where it is used to heat and light homes and businesses the company “regularly provides power to the grid and would provide  percent of our capacity to the grid if requested” he saidin documents announcing its intent to go public by merging with a technical support company greenidge said it “currently operates  mw of mining” at the dresden plant and would be up to  mw by the end of  any excess power produced above that would be sold to the grid at a profit during a cold snap in february chief executive officer jeff kirt told wouldbe investors that greenidge made so much money selling power that its cost to mine a bitcoin was minus  said it plans to expand its business model and be operating  mw of mining capacity by  although no additional projects are planned for new york mckeon saida megawatt is enough to power about  homes in new yorkbitcoin mining centers like the one in dresden consume vast amounts of electricity worldwide bitcoin mining consumes as much electricity as the entire country of argentina population  million said lee mcknight an information studies professor at syracuse university a princeton university professor told congress in  that bitcoin mining accounted for about  of the entire globe’s electrical consumption or about the same as all of new york stateto earn bitcoins more on that later you need as much computer processing power as possible and that means you need lots of electricity to run those processers the cheaper the power the more computers you can run and the better your odds of getting a bitcoin now valued at about  cofounder of coinmint which runs the mining center in massena in the former alcoa aluminum said in a  video that the company was paying about  per megawatthour for electricity the cost on the retail market would be  per megawatt he saidgreenidge plans to go one better the company “expects to become the first publicly traded bitcoin mining company with a wholly owned power plant” according to documents filed with the federal securities and exchange commission to go public this yearthe electricity produced and used on site is called “behind the meter” because it doesn’t get distributed into the overall power gridgreenidge touts upstate new york’s “northern dust free climate that ensures no need for expensive air conditioning” and greenidge’s access to “some of the lowest cost natural gas in north america”mckeon declined to say how much greenidge paid for gasenvironmentalists point out that some of that gas likely comes from hydraulic fracturing another controversial energyintensive process that extracts natural gas from rock a mile or more below the earth’s surface they note that greenidge in  received  million for a gas pipeline project through gov andrew cuomo’s competitive regional awards the state said the project “would not have a significant effect on the environment” and “will provide a needed source of energy”“they got a  million economic development grant to put a pipeline to a frackedgasburning facility” said joseph campbell president of seneca lake guardiangreenidge said in its merger announcement that it captured  bitcoins in the year ending feb  a bitcoin’s value can fluctuate but on monday was worth about  that means greenidge’s  bitcoin take is worth somewhere about  million the company said it had spent just  million to mine those bitcoinsbitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is virtual money stored as an investment or used to pay online transactions it’s sort of like paypal without the bank it’s also akin to wikipedia anyone can participate and see what everyone else has done because all of the transactions are public and onlineto snag a bitcoin your computer has to be the one that solves a complicated algorithm that helps to validate a long string of transactions every bitcoinmining computer in the world from brazil to china to dresden is competing at the same time for a single bitcoin which is why the process sucks up so much power a new bitcoin is awarded every  minutes“in true darwinian fashion the most powerful miners specialized computers consuming the most power win the most bitcoin” according to seeking alpha a website that gives investing advicethere are a finite number of bitcoins –  million and nearly  million of them have already been claimed each bitcoin gets progressively harder to get because the algorithms become increasingly complex that uses even more computing powerthe seneca lake power plant was built in  and it burned coal until it shut down in  the company that owns greenidge invested  million to get the plant running again switching it to natural gas the plant reopened in  and began bitcoin mining in  recently won approval from the town of torrey to add four buildings to the site which will house another  mining machinesresidents and environmental groups including the sierra club have filed a lawsuit in state court saying the proposed expansion of the plant in yates county will require enormous amounts of cooling water to be drawn from the lake which will then be piped back into the lake at higher temperatures“given the amount of power that will be used there are significant issues of air pollution and the discharge of heated water that will wind up in the lake” said richard lippes the buffalo lawyer representing the homeowners
