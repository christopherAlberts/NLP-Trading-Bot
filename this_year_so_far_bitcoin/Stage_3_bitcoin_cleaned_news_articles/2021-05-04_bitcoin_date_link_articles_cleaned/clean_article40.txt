qe ∞   trillion in spending fuels qendless bitcoin stocks bonds real estateit should come as no surprise that the wealth gap continues to increase to levels not seen since the great depression the rise of bitcoin is testament to thisstrong uptrends in the price of stocks commodities and real estate fuel the gap that said bitcoin is facilitating a transformation of wealth many younger investors are buying bitcoin as they prefer it over goldat its current price it is highly likely it will at some point be worth well over  million then  million and so on it is just a question of how long it will take black swans notwithstanding for it to reach such price levels at around  today this represents orders of magnitude of price increasepresident biden has proposed more government spending with his  trillion american families plan  trillion american jobs plan and his  trillion american rescue plan for a whopping total of  trillion this is on par with the staggering franklin delano roosevelt increases in spending which arguably kept the country in a state of depressionwealth redistribution from the haves to havenots has been the goal of the democrats ie the left as they mistakenly believe this will ultimately be good for the economy in reality the wealthy always find ways to reduce taxes through the use of legal loopholes as they can afford the best accountantsmeanwhile the economy is impacted negatively as some wealthy relocate their businesses offshore thus pay less or no tax in the new jurisdiction this negatively impacts the economy in their respective country making life more difficult for the middle and lower classessingularly history shows the left has created much debt with the mistaken keynesian notion that this would stimulate the economy in reality the policies of the left such as large government expenditures large redistributions of wealth via high taxes large deficits and the large printing of money have always ultimately led to wealth gaps debt crises money shortages and the eventual collapse of fiatone pivotal result that moved the us dollar close to its end was how this forced the us to go off the gold standard in while the pendulum may swing from one extreme to the other from the left to the right then back to the left the long term effect has been and will continue to be the devaluation of money less productivity means more money must be printed to pay off rising debtsthis is why reserve currencies have limited lifespans with the climax ending in the very few owning the most while the middle class is pushed lower such a system is a house of cards typically met with deep social unrest revolution andor warthe tipping pointbased on historical cycles in the economy we are at the tipping point of the longterm debt cycle which averages roughly  to  years based on extensive studies done by ray dalio who founded bridgewater – the largest fund in the usfrom roosevelt’s new deal to ww ii we had bigger government up through the  as represented by higher taxes on the wealthy then the reagan tax cuts came followed by the bush tax cuts representing smaller government as taxes on the wealthy trended lowerpresident obama reversed this trend with obamacare taxes though president trump countered it with his tax cuts across the boardpresident biden however wants to create the largest government spending programs and tax hikes since roosevelt while top tax rates would remain below the peak rates in the  biden’s proposal would result in a four to six per cent increase of tax rates on the top  per cent and a decline in aftertax income of roughly  per cent though as mentioned above there are always ways for the rich to adjust these numbers to their advantagefor the bottom earners taxes paid will be largely unchanged though they will be receiving new benefits and tax creditsimage courtesy of ray dalioeconomic principles never changewhile some things are different from the roosevelt years some things stay the same such as the repetition of the long term debt cycle as it is driven by basic economic principlesbut this cycle can be broken as i’ve written in previous articles the exponential growth of gamechanging technologies such as ai and blockchain can create immense utility thus can help productivity and wealth creation soar this can offset the mountains of debt creation thus soften the landing to avert a global crash a global revolution or outright warwhile capitalism has been the best system for productivity and wealth creation it has fallen short when it comes to helping the havenots because of the way the system has been designed while capitalist principles must remain in place the system must also be redesigned so not just the haves but the havenots are properly educated they will then become a thriving part of the work force rather than unemployable adults this will avert civil unrest and revolutionsuniversal basic incomeuniversal basic income ubi has been proposed in various countries to address the needs of the many but just giving handouts encourages a welfare state as history has shown when fiat is pushed into the hands of the many the issue then becomes how much is enough instead as a vital key part of proper education and productivity certain technologies must be provided to those who lack them this includes a mobile phone a laptop and broadband wifisuch investments will ultimately provide much higher returns than the base costs with the increase in wealth from technologies growing exponentially such base costs can be met then the issue of those in poorer communities lacking the basics such as broadband wifi an adequate computer and mobile phone will be solvedthis will increase gdp as well as economic stability as the wealth gap is narrowed by virtue of more people across the spectrum contributing to growth but nothing will change unless the systemic issues are met head on so articles such as this one will hopefully serve to spur others into action who are connected to government at local state and federal levels to create the necessary changes that will facilitate this form of “ubi”dr chris kacher nuclear physicist phd turned stockcrypto trading
