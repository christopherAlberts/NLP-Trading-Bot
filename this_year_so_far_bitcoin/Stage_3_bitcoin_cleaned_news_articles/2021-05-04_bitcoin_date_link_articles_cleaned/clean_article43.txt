at berkshire hathaways annual meeting on saturdaymunger berkshires  vice chairman also defended big tech companies from claims that they need to be broken up and he said unchecked federal spending would end in disasterhere are mungers  best quotes from the meeting lightly edited and condensed for clarity its crazy to think anybody is going to be smart enough to hug the money and then just come out on the bottom tick in some crazy crisis and spend it all thats too tough a standard anybody who expects that of berkshire is out of his mind  dismissing the idea that berkshire could have deployed a large chunk of its cash pile when markets tanked last spring warren and i dont have to agree on every damn little thing we do  commenting on berkshire exiting its position in costco mungers favorite company i would not like to see our present giants brought down to some low level based on any competitive reasoning i dont think theyre doing a lot of harm to any competitor i think theyre a credit to the market credit to our civilization  arguing against breaking up big tech companies theres a good chance that this extreme conduct is more feasible than everybody thought but i do know if you keep just doing it without any limit that it will end in disaster  suggesting that loose monetary and fiscal policy may be more sustainable than feared but cant go on foreverread more goldman sachs buy these  highgrowth stocks that are investing in cash cows for the future at the highest rates in the sp  its a moral failing to some extent the easy money made by things like spacs and derivatives and so on  you push that to excess it causes horrible problems with civilization it reflects no credit on the people who are doing it and no credit on the regulators and monitors that will allow it its not just stupid its shameful i dont mind the poor fish that gamble i dont like the professionals that take the suckers  emphasizing that hes far less concerned about amateur investors speculating than he is about the trading apps taking advantage of them were used to shooting fish in a barrel but thats gotten harder  bemoaning the lack of bargain stocks on the market bernie sanders has basically won with everything boomed off so high and interest rates so low the millennial generation is going to have a hell of a time getting rich compared to our generation the difference between the rich and the poor in the generation thats rising is going to be a lot less so bernie has won he did it by accident but he won if youre repurchasing stock just to pull it higher its deeply immoral but if youre repurchasing stock because its a fair thing to do in the interest of your existing shareholders its a highly moral act and the people who are criticizing it are bonkers its probably a mistake to be anticapitalist capitalism is what raises gdp for everybody im a little wary of just constantly being mad at people because they have a little more money it is stupid for states to drive out their wealthiest citizens the old people that dont commit crimes that donate to the local charity  who in the hell in the right mind would drive out the rich people florida and places like that are very shrewd and places like california are being very stupid its contrary to the interest of the state i hate the bitcoin success i dont welcome a currency thats so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth nor do i like just shuffling out a few extra billions and billions and billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air i should say modestly that i think the whole development is disgusting and contrary to the interest of civilization ill leave the criticism to others oh warren even though you shot and missed you were at least shooting at an elephant the cost of healthcare in singapore is  of what it is in the united states and their medical system works better so you were shooting at a huge elephant but as you found out its very hard for people to get very enthusiastic about losing part of their income  commenting on haven berkshires joint venture with amazon and jpmorgan to lower employee healthcare costs and improve care its just godawful that something like that would draw investment from civilized men and decent citizens its deeply wrong we dont want to make our money selling things that are bad for people  accusing robinhood and other trading apps of encouraging amateur investors to gamble on stocks and dabble with options trading the states have replaced the mafia as the proprietor in the numbers game they pushed the mafia aside and said thats our business not yours it doesnt make me proud of my government  comparing state lotteries to the italian lottery run by the mob if youre not a little confused by whats going on you dont understand it were in uncharted territory  arguing that nobody knows the mediumterm effects of stimulus checks nearzero interest rates and aggressive federal spending on the us stock market and economy
