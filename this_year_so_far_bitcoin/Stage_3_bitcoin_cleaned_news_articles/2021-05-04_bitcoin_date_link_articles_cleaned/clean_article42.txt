of crypto regulations would be passed within the coming two weeks but stopped short of calling for an outright ban“you cannot fix anything by banning crypto and we do not intend to do this” he saidthe

would be levied as a direct tax or an income tax on crypto assetsaccording to finance journalist erkan oz taxing investors would be much easier to do through banks“we know that a tax regulation is inevitable we just don’t know its shape and process payment and electronic money establishments being banned from the process can be interpreted as a foreshadowing for taxation from the source via bank channels” he said“i hope tax rates will not be so high and that the turkish implementation will come close to the us and eu regulations in the coming years”countries like the us and the uk tax

move their projects out of the countryspeaking to coindesk on the unfolding situation btcturk’s ceo ozgur guneri doesn’t expect regulation to limit investment in the long termrather he sees the current moment as an intermittent phase where turkish regulators are in the process of deciding what shape crypto regulation will take“in the next few months we are going to see regulation in turkey where business government and individual stakeholders will be operating in a much safer environment” guneri said“when that happens i believe the turkish central bank and capital markets will allow regulated companies to interact with the new regulated crypto asset industry”source trt world
