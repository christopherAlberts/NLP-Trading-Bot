natwest the uk retail bank has announced it will not engage with business customers who accept payment in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies it follows recent announcements from hsbc that it won’t allow transfers from digital wallets and won’t enable customers to buy shares in companies associated with cryptocurrencies such as coinbase or microstrategythe feeling from both banks is that cryptocurrencies are high risk and therefore justify a cautious approach though they note that their stance could change if and when regulation evolvesinterestingly this is not a view shared by institutions across the atlantic both morgan stanley and goldman sachs are now offering their wealth management clients the opportunity to invest in bitcoin indeed the initial uptake has been strong with morgan stanley alone drawing in nearly  million £ million of investment in two weekswhy the cautionthe cautious approach of natwest and hsbc stems from the  recommendations of the financial action task force a  initiative geared towards defeating money laundering these recommendations mandate each member state to implement measures requiring their banks to scrutinise customers’ transactions for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financingunder recommendation one the antimoney laundering framework is to be applied on the basis of perceived risk in other words if a transaction or business activity is perceived to be more risky than usual it needs closer scrutiny by the bank to ensure compliance with the frameworkthis increases the strain on bank resources to verify that a transaction or business activity is safe to continue but they also face large fines for noncompliance where there are deficiencies in their implementation of the framework or if things go wrongnatwest and hsbc are no strangers to being under the spotlight for compliance issues hsbc was fined  billion by us authorities in  while natwest faces charges over significant compliance breaches in the uk while these charges relate to traditional moneylaundering compliance breaches perhaps it goes some way to explaining the caution of the two banksbanks view digital currencies as risky because they have the potential to be used for money laundering they are targets for fraud and scams and their value can be extremely unstable in the shortterm indeed the uk’s financial conduct authority has warned that those investing and dealing with cryptocurrency are at risk of losing all their funds rather than face the enhanced burden of investigating businesses and individuals dealing with these assets it is easier for banks to avoid the risk and not engage with themthis situation is not unique to cryptocurrencies for instance it has long been a byproduct of the antimoney laundering requirements that banks have refused to offer financial services to charities operating in highrisk jurisdictions the banking sector accepts this reality particularly given that charities tend to be relatively lowvalue customersthe wrong approachon the face of it banks are perfectly entitled not top offer financial services to businesses transacting in digital currencies as well as antimoney laundering banks are bound by antifraud measures and consumer protection fradulent crypto transactions are both difficult to spot and impossible to reverse so the risks of engaging are high at least until the market establishes itself and the business case to engage is strongerof course this is not to say that they have necessarily made the right call the fact that the leading us banks have taken a different approach suggests that they think the potential rewards are worthy of the compliance burden in defence of cryptocurrencies they are both more traceable than cash and used less for money launderingand while it is true that there is a risk of significant losses with cryptocurrency investments there is also clear potential for big gains banks are profitmaking businesses the returns from crypto investments in recent months – notwithstanding the big selloff in the past couple of days – plus the very bullish forecasts ought to prompt them to at least speculate in the area regulatory burden asidewe could simplistically blame the uk banks for either being too cautious or not doing enough to help these businesses but it overlooks the bigger design flaw in the antimoney laundering framework compliance measures are a significant drain on a bank’s resources where a transaction or business is considered highrisk banks and their workers also face criminal sanctions including large fines where they fail to properly implement the rules which is particularly troublesome when it is almost impossible for a bank to identify what a suspicious crypto transaction looks likewithout a guaranteed high return for the bank it is easier to derisk and not engage with these businesses this represents a missed opportunity for banks and a potentially unnecessary stifling of legitimate business growth for companies wishing to deal with cryptocurrenciesbanks are portrayed as the public villain but the bigger problem is at a much higher level it is a political and legal issue which requires the attention and intervention of lawmakers to address the fact it is much easier for banks to derisk than to comply with the rules and help these businesses grow
