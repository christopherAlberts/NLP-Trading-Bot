a gasguzzling energy plant that overlooks one of new york’s bucolic finger lakes has received planning permission that will allow it to expand its significant onsite bitcoin mining business by  machines to a total of approximately  minersthe approval for the greenidge plant expansion granted through a fourtoone vote by the planning board of the small town of torrey on monday wades past the concerns of environmental activists who have railed against the former coalfired plant coming back online to mine bitcoin using natural gas they say the expansion will produce more harmful emissions which could pollute the water of nearby seneca lake and harm the yields of local vineyards while undermining the state’s climate goalsadvertisementminers process bitcoin transactions by solving complicated math puzzles the carrot dangled before them is newlyminted bitcoin and miners expend immense amounts of energy while in pursuit of this prize key to being a profitable bitcoin miner then is to have the cheapest energy on tap whether the source is renewable or fossil fuelsthis reality has reignited debate over the value that cryptocurrencies provide versus their environmental impact while it rages on a mix of renewables and fossil fuels including coal and natural gas continue to power the networknow that bitcoins price has risen tenfold over the past year ailing fossil fuel plants that have been left behind by the country’s slow move to renewable and nuclear energy are ramping up once again to make the most of the new technology—and the money a few examples a struggling coal plant in montana staved off closure by partnering with a cryptocurrency mining firm last year a bitcoin mine set up shop onsite at an oil pipeline in texas to turn excess gas into cheap electricity and gas companies themselves have started to build onsite bitcoin mines to turn their own waste gas into profit greenidge is one more plant that looked to bitcoin to turn its fortunes around“these obsolete fossil fuel sources become an easy prey for bitcoin miners who could then use it to get really cheap and constant energy” said alex de vries founder of digiconomist a site that tracks the environmental impact of bitcoin mininggreenidge was founded in  in dresden new york written off in  after selling coal power to the new york grid became unprofitable the struggling company became a money spinner after institutional investors among them private equity firm atlas holdings turned it into a natural gas plant in  in  it launched a test to use a portion of its cheap power to mine bitcoin and the operation went into full swing last yearadvertisementthe switch to bitcoin mining helped save the plant which alongside selling power to the new york state grid now uses about  percent of its capacity or  megawatts to run bitcoin miners greenidge said it mined  bitcoin from the year that preceded february  and spent approximately  to mine each one that’s a bargain at today’s bitcoin prices—about  last month the company estimated that it will draw in  million of revenue this year before taxes assuming bitcoin stays at roughly  its current price and that mining continues to generate  per megawatt hourwith permission to build four new structures that it can fill with mining rigs greenidge hopes to double its mining capacity to  megawatts by june  quadruple it by the end of next year and reach  megawatts by  to help fund all this greenidge wants to become listed on the nasdaqbut what’s good for greenidge is bad for the planet and at odds with new yorks own goal of reaching  percent renewable electricity by  environmental activists say in a letter to the new york state’s environmental conservation department earthjustice and the sierra club concluded that greenidge’s bitcoin mining increased its  emissions tenfold within a year of operations from  tons to  tons and if greenidge uses all of its resources to mine bitcoin it would produce just over  million tons of  a year the letter claimedgreenidge rejects the claims “there is simply no way that this facility will emit over  million tons of  in a year” said spokesperson michael mckeonin a statement provided to motherboard greenidge said that it will “not only operate squarely within our existing environmental permits and local ordinances but will produce more hightech jobs more tax revenues for our local governments and more dollars to local business through our partnership the torrey planning board declined to commentadvertisementin a notice posted on april  the new york department of environmental conservation said that it will monitor the greenidge mining operation closely to ensure compliance with current permits and said it will review future permits with a particular focus on the potential climate change impacts and consistency with the nationleading emissions limits set out in new york it will do so in consultation with the us environmental protection agency and the new york state climate action councillocal campaigners say that the environmental damage caused by greenidge’s bitcoin mining could harm the economy of the finger lakes which is reliant on its environment they fear that the bitcoin mining operation which pumps hot water into the lake could increase blooms of harmful algae and pollutants such as arsenic which are already present in the lakeyvonne taylor vice president of seneca lake guardian an environmental group that is against the plant’s bitcoin mining expansion said that over time the bitcoin mining farm could poison the water that feeds into some residents’ homes and harm wildlife in seneca lake“this goes far beyond the borders of the town of torrey she said if you have the wherewithal to think about the risk versus the reward it’s a no brainer its a really bad idea and this sets a really bad precedent for all of new york”advertisementrichard rainey a managing partner of forge cellar one of several wineries that farm and buy grapes along the finger lakes worries that the pollution could contribute to climate change that could cause his grapes to overripen develop frost too early or become contaminated with harmful substances “its so at odds with what were trying to accomplish in this region” he saidthe wine industry is far more economically important than the bitcoin mining plant said rainey since it brings in annual revenues of  billion and has attracted worldfamous vineyards “you dont want to shoot the goose that lays a golden egg” he saidboth taylor and rainey raised concerns that increased emissions could damage the  billion tourism industry that’s driven by the lake and surrounding forestspreventing the bitcoin mining operation would also “preserve the park and natural beauty of the region” said rainey it is a true paradise said taylor whose family has centurieslong ties to the regiongreenidge rejects such concerns as false and misleading “to suggest that greenidge is incompatible with the economic wellbeing of the region is absurd” it said in a pointbypoint rebuttal to the sierra club letter that it sent to motherboard no harmful algae blooms were recorded within  miles of its facility and rainfall determined the algae it said—“it isn’t greenidge”this isnt the first time that bitcoins hunger for cheap electricity has run afoul of the sensibilities of citizens in  the city of plattsburgh in upstate new york instituted a moratorium on bitcoin mining because it believed an influx of firms were sucking up the citys cheap power increasing the price of energy for residents since then concerns around bitcoins energy use and the potentially harmful sources of that juice for example coalfired plants in china have only grownthe approved expansion isnt the end of the story for greenidge taylor is among  individuals and institutions who filed a classaction lawsuit to stop the expansion the complaint filed in december against greenidge and the town of torrey’s planning board said that the board granted permission without sufficiently studying the impact of bitcoin mining farms on the environment and that greenidge did not disclose that the power plant was reopening to mine bitcoin it was to service the new york state energy grid it said“there was no mention at that time of anything other than the use of the energy in that fashion” said attorney richard lippes the lawyer who filed the case lippes said that the claimants still want the court to stop greenidge’s construction of the four new buildings despite monday’s vote in favor of the expansion it also seeks further studies around whether the plant will increase harmful algae blooms
