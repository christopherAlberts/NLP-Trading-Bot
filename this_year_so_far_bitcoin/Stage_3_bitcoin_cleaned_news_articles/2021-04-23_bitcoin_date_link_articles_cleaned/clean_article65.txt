fidelity can be relatively assured that amazon and facebook wont take them on anytime soon because of one word  regulation say what you like about the online brokers technology or lack thereof but these companies have a hardearned core competency in reading what is doable in financial services when every action is being policed its a lot to ask a mark zuckerberg or jeff bezos to freelance in that discipline even with its super strippeddown model robinhood is on a very steep learning curve with the sec never mind massachusetts schwab and fidelity leaders have taken divergent paths to provide cryptocurrency services but schwab is now inching toward fido and even hinting it will leapfrog the pioneer but clearly both firms are watching sec chair gary gensler like hawks to assure that their regulatorreading track records  and brands  remain untarnished comment sonly  months ago charles schwab  co said crypto was off its radar now ceo walter bettinger is a convert but hes holding

will be client oriented he saidschwabs big change is presumably in response to its clientele before it said clients were indifferent to crypto not so much nowwe can certainly see some of the client

with blackandwhite regulations that can be applied to a fuzzy financial asset classwe recognize well whats going on we would like to see more regulatory clarity and if and when that comes you should
