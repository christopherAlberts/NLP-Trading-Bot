volatility in bitcoin could prove beneficial to gold which has been losing the popularity battle against bitcoinbitcoin chart looks a bit negative bitcoin has been one of the reasons that held gold back some natural buyers of gold have been buyers of bitcoin and if bitcoin stays down next push higher in gold could see more sponsorship and the precious metal could take some people back from

increasebidens proposal means that the federal tax rates for some investors could be as high as  bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the mattersome of the highest capitalgains taxes around the world are in the  mark most are around  this is an overreach and with bidens infrastructure spending plans we could be looking at stagflation pavilonis said stagflation is a period of inflation combined with a decline in gdpbidens plan is impacting equities cryptocurrencies and most importantly the us dollar which has an inverse relationship to goldthe dollar does not seem to be liking a lot of the policies coming out of washington including the biden administrations proposed new capitalgains tax increase also one of the next big initiatives is infrastructure spending both of those factors are hurting the dollar and that is positive for gold said gainesville coins precious metals expert everett millmanif the tax structure becomes less favorable for those investors holding a lot of capital priced in us dollars they are going to find other places to put their money millman explained if the capital gains tax makes the us a less favorable destination there will be less incentive for people to hold money in us dollars that is going to hurt the purchasing power of the dollar generally millman saidalso markets are not forgetting about inflation which is said to be a major driver for gold later this year inflation expectations are the highest they have been in years we have not seen a lot of measured inflation yet because the velocity of money is pretty low but with infrastructure spending coming up markets think that at some point this will boost inflation millman addedgetting through pavilonis noted that once we get above  golds moves higher could become bigger due to fewer resistance levelsgold and silver would do very well we are set up for a longer run higher here in gold if we close above  we can move up quickly towards  he saidfor gold to get past the  level the us dollar index would have to drop below  noted nedoss on the week gold hasnt done too bad as long as we close above  it will be a positive week he said we would need to see the us dollar put in new lows to take out  might need the  handle in the dollar indexthe reason why  is proving to be a strong resistance level is that the  level is the  moving average for gold its possible to hit  with all this inflation talk i am surprised gold is not doing better nedoss saidmillman noted that if  is breached there is a ton of room for gold to rally towards its highs in the  rangehowever for next week one thing to be aware of is potentially downward pressure coming from positive macroeconomic data millman warnedwe have seen some green shoots in manufacturing a lot of shortterm reactions to economic data will be bad for gold and good for the broader economy the  is pretty strong resistance level that bulls would have to fight to push gold above itdata to watchthere is a slate of
