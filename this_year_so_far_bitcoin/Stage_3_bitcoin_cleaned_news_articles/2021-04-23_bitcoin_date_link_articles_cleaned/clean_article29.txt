april    min readthis story originally appeared on valuewalkas institutional investors continue to adopt bitcoin one concern that has come up is its connection to energy and environmental issues esg experts have argued that the cryptocurrency strains the environment because of all the energy it takes to mine a single bitcoin  hedge fund letters conferences and morehowever in a recent report coindesk argues that it isnt the case saying that bitcoin doesnt use as much energy as some would thinkenergy consumption and bitcoin miningthe news outlet admits that the cryptocurrency is energyintensive as individuals businesses and groups known as miners use specialized hardware to mine the cryptocurrency they process vast volumes of transactions by grouping them into blocks and racing against each other to find a random variable that meets the preestablished protocol requirementuncovering that variable enables the block to be added to the blockchain but it also consumers quite a bit of energy in the process miners are rewarded for the computations carried out on their machines with the issue of new bitcoins mining becomes profitable when the value of the new bitcoins is more than the cost of the power used to mine themcoindesk questions whether bitcoin mining needs to consume as much energy as it generally does the publication notes that the cryptocurrency was created for transactions between two parties without a middleman decentralizing the payment network for both parties to trust each other they must agree about who owns what and with strong enough security on the networkaccording to coindesk bitcoins energyintensive consensus protocol is how the network achieves that consensus and integrity if consensus were easy to achieve then the network could be easily attacked mining is energyintensive so that it is prohibitively expensive to attack the bitcoin networkif bitcoin were a countrybitcoin is a proofofwork chain with fairly transparent energy use because theres only a single step between power input and bitcoin output as a result bitcoins energy footprint is fully contained by the energy consumed by mining today bitcoin uses about  of global energy consumption which would rank it  in energy consumption if it were a countrycoindesk emphasizes that bitcoin isnt a country adding that comparing its power consumption to that of countries doesnt accomplish much more than understanding how much it consumes of the nations with mining operations bitcoin makes up no more than  of any one countrys total power consumptionin the us video game consoles make up about  of energy consumption while construction commercial cooling commercial ventilation and commercial lighting range from  to  coindesk explains that such a context is important because energy use for bitcoin mining is spread among multiple countries which means its useless to compare the cryptocurrencys consumption to that of countrieswhat kind of energy does bitcoin useas its been established that bitcoin mining uses a lot of energy the next consideration is what kind of energy it uses one of the big concerns about energy use is that bitcoin miners in asia may be using coalfired electricity which is known for its mass pollution across china however coindesk reports that a sizable percentage of the power used to mine bitcoin is renewablethe publication referenced a  study conducted by the ccaf which found that  of the total energy used for bitcoin mining came from renewable sources in  up from  the year before the study also found that  of miners were using renewable energy sources as part of their energy mixproblems with renewable energy sources for bitcoincoindesk points out that hydroelectricity is by far the most common source of renewable energy used by bitcoin miners however it is also widely considered the least desirable form due to the damage caused by mismanagement of the system and potential methane emissions coindesk argues that bitcoin miners shouldnt become overly dependent on any one source of renewable energy because there is no perfect sourcefor example while wind energy is costeffective it is intermittent and wind turbines can hurt local wildlife solar energy faces possible pollution from the photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into energy and it is intermittent and inefficient in conversiongeography is also an essential part of the conversation over bitcoin mining and energy consumption according to the ccaf about  of the hashrate is in china where energy generation has been heavily skewed toward coal however  of the mining occurs in provinces where the energy mix is mostly renewable the rest of the mining was in xinjiang and inner mongolia where coal is prevalent however operations in inner mongolia have been shut down and xinjiang has been moving toward renewable energybitcoin as a batterycoindesk also made another interesting point bitcoin can be seen as a sort of battery because of its use as a store of value while bitcoin mining is mobile energy production isnt always especially in the case of renewable energybitcoin miners could set up shop in a remote area with lots of renewable energy an economic boon to the community while the idea of bitcoin as a battery may be a bit misleading it is serving as a storage location but it is storing value instead of power miners are taking unused energy that would otherwise be wasted and transforming it into value through bitcoin
