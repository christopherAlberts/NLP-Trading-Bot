money performs three social functions simultaneously first it is an asset a vehicle for storing value empowering savings second money is currency a medium to exchange value enabling consumption and third money acts as a unit of account eg credits and debits a way to keep trackfor as long as anyone can remember those three roles have been bundled together the development of crypto markets and financial technology however are unbundling those functions creating new instruments that perform a single role rather than all three simultaneously in turn that alleviates tradeoffs faced by moneyissuers expanding the possibilities for monetary policyto illuminate the unbundling process let’s look at three recent case studies with key lessons for central bankers who are exploring digital currencies  bitcoin’s hard fork  china’s dcep experiments and  the evolution of defi on the ethereum networkben falk is an insights director at eyq ey’s global think tank focusing at the intersection of technology finance public policy and macroeconomycase study  – moneyasasset bagehot’s dictum drives a hard forkbitcoin’s evolution resulting in the  “hard fork” of the network illustrates this unbundling the term crypto“currency” is a misnomer applied to bitcoin whose architecture and governance make it better suited to store value rather than exchange it with a fixed token supply and released in declining quantities on a fixed schedule bitcoin creates incentives to hoard tokens the resulting artificial scarcity makes the token price highly volatilevolatility is undesirable in a currency and unit of account and as a result the adoption of bitcoin as a means of payment has been slow scarcity however is an attractive feature in an asset and indeed most interest in bitcoin is speculative with new demand from private investors including retail institutional asset managers and hedge fundsthus bitcoinascurrency suffered from what technologists call poor productmarket fit the misalignment between the design of the architecture and the targeted application created conflicts among bitcoin constituencies some members of the network sought to increase token supply or to raise the block size limit making bitcoin better suited for exchange purposes but at the cost of undermining bitcoin’s role as an asset no compromise was reached and so a breakaway subnetwork “hard forked” by duplicating the blockchain to create “bitcoin cash”subscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policycentral bankers might recognize the tradeoff driving that conflict as the same one surmised in bagehot’s dictum because money performs multiple functions issuers trade off satisfying demand for exchanging value with demand for storing value this feature of money in a simple macroeconomic model generates business cycle fluctuations as rising uncertainty gives people the incentive to hoard cashbut where central banks rely on bagehot’s rule of thumb the bitcoin network devised an alternative technical solution by unbundling money’s dual functions the hard fork created a second entirely different token targeting the more specific role of money exchanging value demanded by a more narrowly defined user basethat highlights a key lesson technology founders and venture capitalists have known for some time the design of the token must be aligned to the purpose of the instrument productmarket fit comes from a deep understanding of user perspectives and many rely on “design thinking” to drive innovation with that principle in mindfurther the experience demonstrates the expanded policy possibilities created by emerging technologies freed from the constraints of the physical cash world central bankers have a wider range of options to pursue their objectives including but not limited to deeply negative interest ratessome instruments even target specific liquidity motives for example ripple satisfies a preference for international liquidity by relying on a design that sacrifices decentralization to instantly transfer and settle crosscountry balances at scale similarly zcash leverages a decentralized architecture alongside zeroknowledge proofs to target a privacy motive the design maximizes user privacy without sacrificing market transparency helping to alleviate the tradeoff between the two objectivescombining emerging technologies in novel ways may enable the creation of additional new unbundled varieties of more targeted money to better satisfy divergent constituencies with varying demands possibly alleviating the tradeoff bagehot identified several hundred years agocase study  – moneyascurrency china resurrects gesell moneyno country is as advanced in developing central bank digital currencies cbdcs as china is one of the leading innovators globally china has been researching “digital yuan” since  and the people’s bank of china pboc is committed to deploying a digital currency nationally it recently completed an experiment in the southern city of shenzhen of the “digital currency electronic payment” dcep mechanism a stablecoin backed  with fiat chinese yuan cnyin one of the largest trials of its kind residents applied to participate in a lottery administered by the shenzhen local government selected participants were issued “red packets” of ecny deposits which could be accessed by opening an ewallet through the official digital renminbi appto ensure consumers used the tokens and in doing so tested the new infrastructure supporting dcep the pboc set special conditions on the trial the digital currency paid no interest it could not be transferred to a bank account to be saved and it couldn’t be given to another person the cash could be spent only at designated retailers for a limited period thus consumers faced strong incentives to spend the money before it expired as the balances carried an implied negative interest rate and indeed spend they did with about  of the money issued ultimately used to buy goods and services during the testthe design of the experiment is perhaps accidentally very close to proposals from silvio gesell a german entrepreneur whom the late economist john maynard keynes called an “unduly neglected prophet” gesell argued for a variety of unbundled money that could not be saved but rather could only be spent eg a medium of exchange but not a store of value as an incetive gesell suggested money should decay and expire just as the ecny did in the shenzhen trialgesell’s controversial ideas have reemerged among leading central bankers globally in recent years as they search for new policy tools at or even below the zerobound on interest rates emerging innovations are helping to make them a reality again nearly a century after they were first attemptedchina’s proofofconcept therefore demonstrates that highpowered varieties of decaying digital currency are technically feasible an important international milestone innovative varieties of money may give central banks greater firepower to stimulate growth employment and inflation the experiment also highlights that hypothesized financial stability risks such as disruptions to existing payments mechanisms are manageable opening the door to further trials globally and rapidly accelerating innovationcase study  – moneyasaccounting units ether defi and smart moneyone sector demonstrating rapid innovation is the development of smart contracts and programmable finance incubated on the decentralized ethereum blockchain smart contracts encode in software the terms of a paper contract which are automatically executed depending on certain conditionsthese automated programmable credits and debits perform a range of functions from simple expressions like expiry dates or numerical thresholds to more complex programs with multiple triggers like those in loan agreements innovation taking place in the open and transparent ethereum community is therefore generating positive knowledge spillovers for policymakersa host of new applications are proliferating within this network broadly under the umbrella term “decentralized finance” or defi for instance decentralized exchanges dexs where users can trade tokens directly with one another without a trusted intermediary are seeing user adoption lending platforms that encourage loaning and borrowing of digital assets have also grown in popularitythe application compound even sets interest rates algorithmically to balance supply and demand for funds in a fascinating test case for monetary policymakers because these programs are open source they can be used as building blocks and combined to create entirely new applicationsfor example smart contracts could be linked to macroeconomic shocks like recessions financial events such as bank runs or policy measures including tax changes to automatically provide liquidity relief to distressed firms and households or they might be linked to one another creating a controlled chain reaction to propagate liquidity injections at specified velocitiesimportantly because the overall structure is observable and can be known prior to events smart contracts might provide visibility into how financial instability cascades through the system deploying smart money could help central banks achieve their objectivesthis ethereum ecosystem offers a realworld test of the competitiveness of central bank instruments relative to private digital ones the good news is that by an overwhelming margin ethereum participants prefer at the moment to denominate transactions in us dollars as soon as private entrepreneurs issued digital tokens backed  by us dollars their instruments became the most popular in the network and the primary unit of account in defi applicationsthe experience demonstrates the importance of ecosystems in stimulating innovation a core driver of ethereum’s success so far has been the wide range of developers engineers economists traders financiers borrowers and investors who contribute to the platform large firms frequently invest in ecosystem strategies to boost the transfer of knowledge from beyond their borders before incorporating new insights into their business modelsthese ecosystem models help organizations stay abreast of the latest ideas enabling faster experimentation and subsequent deployment of emerging technologies central banks should consider building their own fintech ecosystems to encourage innovation as indeed some already do with regulatory “sandbox” approachesunbundled money cbdcs and the future of financeacross crypto platforms a primary stated motivation is reducing rentseeking by “middle men” in mainstream financial markets from the libor london interbank offered rate scandal to bernie madoff’s ponzi scheme to the panama papers and associated money laundering and tax evasion the list of proven visible demonstrable rentseeking behavior in the financial sector continues to grow the public has obviously taken note it is that loss of trust that probably represents the greatest threat to monetary sovereignty not any single technology community or platformdisruption from fintech is now unbundling money stripping out each role by creating powerful new instruments targeting a more precisely defined user base new designs might enhance the implementation of monetary policymaking by alleviating fundamental tradeoffs bitcoin emerged in part in response to quantitative easing and perceived inflation risks after central banks sacrificed longrun price stability objectives in order to uphold economic activity and the financial system in the short run the ability to target highly specific constituencies with distinct user needs indicates the revolution is not so much in money itself but perhaps rather in monetary policyfor illustration’s sake imagine a world in which all savings eg future consumption is denominated in bitcoin and all spending eg current consumption is denominated in bitcoin cash such a world is obviously a fantasy as neither instrument satisfies the diverse needs of their constituencies at largebut in this imaginary world one must cross the market to convert savings into spending and vice versa as such the exchange rate between bitcoin and bitcoin cash represents a freely floating interest rate if such a dualtoken strategy was adopted by central banks stateissued money could be priced rather than fiat
