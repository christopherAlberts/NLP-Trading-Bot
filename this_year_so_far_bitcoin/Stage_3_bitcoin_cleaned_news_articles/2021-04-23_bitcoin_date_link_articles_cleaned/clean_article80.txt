when you look at fiat currencies like the us dollar governments can print out as many dollars as they want the same cannot be said for cryptocurrencies most tokens have a hard cap to the number of coins that could be issued or mined as it’s called in the crypto world for bitcoin btc there’s a hard cap of  million tokens that can be mined once this happens there’s going to be no more new bitcoinwhile most people think that’s still a ways away we’re actually getting rather close to hitting that number most of that  million bitcoin has already been mined by now with only a fraction of that initial pool remaining here’s what happens when every single bitcoin gets mined and when that will happenonce the last bitcoin is finally mined these miners won’t be able to make an income from lending their computational power in this manner of course there will be other cryptocurrencies to mine but bitcoin will effectively be “mined out” however according to estimates that isn’t going to happen until sometime around  so not in most of our lifetimesevery ten minutes bitcoin miners “discover” a new block which involves solving a mathematical puzzle that allows the miner to add this block to the blockchain in return the miner that “discovers” this answer earns a certain number of bitcoin as a reward realistically it’s impossible for a single computer to do so especially nowadays so miners combine their computational power together into “mining pools” which split up their bitcoin rewards among all their respective membersout of the  million hard cap on bitcoin we’ve already mined around  million that means there’s less than  million new bitcoin remaining to be “mined” by miners while that might not seem like much the fewer bitcoin that remain the harder it becomes for computers to mine these remaining tokenswhat does this mean for investorswhether bitcoin runs out of supply or not actually doesn’t impact most investors that much the ones that will be most impacted are those making money from mining bitcoin besides them bitcoin will still operate the same way that it does now as a form of ecash that can be traded back and forth among other peoplesource pixabayarticle continues below advertisementfor miners the story is a little different though they wont be able to earn from mining they still will be able to lend their computational power to process transactions on the network in turn they could make money through transaction fees miners that verify blocks on the bitcoin blockchain are entitled to the transaction fees while these fees represent only a tiny portion of most miners’ revenues right now that will change dramatically around the year  when all remaining bitcoin is mined up
