bitcoin sank below  following bidenâ€™s tax plan announcement fundstrat lead digital asset strategist david grider joins yahoo finance live to discussvideo transcriptakiko fujita were starting though this hour with that big selloff that we saw in cryptos  billion in value wiped out from the cryptocurrency market analysts pointing to president bidens plans to raise the longterm capital gains tax as the potential catalyst and we should say btc down more than  in just over a week lets bring in david grider fundstrat lead digital asset strategist david its good to talk to you on this friday how do you look at the selloff that weve seen is this a healthy reset or have we seen the top in the marketdavid grider yeah thanks for having me on i think first we got to recap a little bit where we came from we hit a new alltime high back wednesday of the prior week when coinbase listed and that was a very exciting event and we hit  there and following that i think you saw a little euphoria fall off the market and then we saw some margin leverage kind of unwinding from that as folks were getting on some of these offshore exchanges a bit of extra exposureand we had a little reset of that over the weekend which sparked a little bit of that healthier correction and then coming over into this week weve seen a couple of things that have kind of put a little water on the market from you know some notable folks on wall street calling for some pullbacks to the tax hikes potentially looking at some folks in crypto who have made quite a bit of money over the last few years maybe wanted to take some off the table ahead of that so i think that those are some of the things that have occurred but we dont see this necessarily as something thats taking us to necessarily like a  type market top but more so as something where the market needs to have a healthy cooling off period before the market can continue forwardstory continueszack guzman and david i mean it looked like we got that over the weekend we can talk a lot about maybe leverage built into the market now as defi is taking off and how much that might have been automatically triggered when we got these drawbacks but when you step back and maybe look at things kind of shocking to see how some of these price calls based off the historical cycle of bitcoin still remain intact here i was looking at panteras stock to flow model and its followed that pretty much up so  their year end target might still hold if you think thats going to continue i know you had a  or so target on ether talk to me about maybe the way that thats held up here it hasnt necessarily declined by as much still holding above  what youre seeing when it comes to thatdavid grider yeah thats right zack i think thats a great point we also have a  target on bitcoin as well for the year end and were sticking to that i think one of the things that does give us a bit of confidence kind of where were at with the longer term cycle is that if you look at other large digital assets like ethereum which has held up pretty well in relative terms during even during this pullback bitcoins had its been on a relative basis kind of actually making newer recent highs over the last few yearsso i think that thats a strong indication that big segments of the market really are just seeing capital kind of move around within it and were not necessarily seeing a super flee of capital but i do think you know there could be a period where we do have a quicker we could have some pullbacks but i think you know if youre a trader maybe you can think about that but i think if youre an investor with a longer term time horizon i think theres still reasons that folks should still be involved in cryptoakiko fujita david if were talking about the capital gains tax this idea we should say just being floated out there it hasnt necessarily even been proposed if that was in fact the catalyst that we saw for this selloff what does that tell you about whos actually investing in cryptos right now and the amount of gains theyre seeing how do you make that direct correlationdavid grider yeah i think that its you know we dont know that its necessarily going to go through as its been talked about just yet so i think thats the first thing to know but obviously every market will have its kneejerk reactions as news comes out and you know our policy analyst tom block does think that things it probably wont go through as passed but if you look back to you know just the price moves that weve seen in crypto over the last couple of years i mean people would have quite a bit of capital gains on the table so i think possibly that it was something that also sparked some folks saying look let me maybe ahead of this if this does go through see what i can do to optimize my strategy that wayzack guzman and lastly i mean weve been talking a lot no doubt weve seen from our stats here a lot of people are interested in dogecoin that really has come back down too but it sparked i think another wave of maybe people who hadnt really thought about crypto getting excited taking a look when it comes to that how much does it add or detract from maybe the more established cryptos we talk about in bitcoin ether in some of these other projects when you have that kind of enthusiasm and bitcoin dominance which we also havent really discussed falling as well so how do you see that kind of playing out amongst some of the more established and less established playersdavid grider yeah i think this is a natural thing thats happened in the prior market cycles that weve seen you know after bitcoin breaks its alltime highs you see capital flows within the crypto economy go to other coins and then you also see this dynamic where newer investors who maybe view bitcoin or some of the larger coins as too expensive for them on a dollar basis going to some of these smaller coinsbut the interesting thing about this is that the rally weve seen thus far from  and  has really been institutionally dominated and i think on a mass basis it feels like the new capital flowing in from dogecoin and what were seeing in some of these other coins is kind of the first wave of retail kind of getting excited and involved now i think some folks probably got ahead of themselves and i think and we had that pullback there and its kind of to be expected but i think people were just testing the waters and i think theres the way for more people to kind of get involved from that so i think that thats an encouraging thing
