longconsidered the holy grail of retail crypto investment a uslisted bitcoin etf may be on the horizon supported by a confluence of factors including a new administration and securities watchdog as well as the rapid institutional adoption of bitcoin itself“my guess is we get an etf this year” says mike novogratz galaxy digital founder and ceo “right now the nextbest thing is the grayscale trust”novogratz is referring to the suite of exchange traded products etps sponsored by grayscale investments a subsidiary of digital currency group which also owns coindesk its grayscale bitcoin trust gbtc has exploded with investor money topping nearly  billion in assets but only sophisticated or socalled accredited investors may buy these securities and they are only traded in the overthecounter otc market in the us not listed on the nyse or nasdaq for instanceover  crypto funds have attempted to run the regulatory gauntlet and register their products in the us including two from the winklevoss twins which were ultimately rejected by the securities and exchange commission sec it’s a complicated legal process that includes filing a registration statement with the sec as well as a petition for rule change at the listing exchange such as nyse or nasdaq the archaic registration process for funds coming to market is being streamlined in the us but remains convoluted for many nontraditional etps including those in the crypto spacethe sec has yet to grant a rule change for any of these products denying all but the most recently filed and their registration statements lie dormant grayscale bitcoin trust has filed to list on the nyse arca exchange under the ticker btc — a request that is pendingbut hopes for a bitcoin fund available to the masses now center around the latest vaneck product the vaneck bitcoin trust which filed in the final days of  — just after the previous sec chair jay clayton left office vaneck may be hoping for a friendlier regulatory touch under gary gensler the current nominee to head the secstory continuesgensler was previously commissioner of the commodity futures trading commission cftc the us commodity watchdog there he implemented the sprawling new legal requirements of doddfrank as they applied to derivatives and swaps but he was criticized for his handling of the  mf global bankruptcy which roiled the futures industry for yearscommodity futures trading commission chairman gary gensler testifies before the house financial services committee on capitol hill in washington on tuesday june   ap photojacquelyn martinnovogratz has high hopes for gensler as sec chief characterizing him as tough but also fair with the senate confirmation likely to succeed he says “i am thrilled that gary is the head of the sec full disclosure — we worked together at goldman sachs back in  ‘  he’s got more hair than i do not much not much”all kidding aside he continues “gary taught a class on blockchain at mit and on crypto he understands it cold he’s progressive right and progressives broadly are going to go after  the rent takers crypto is not a rent taker crypto is trying to disrupt the rent takers”pause for greenlighting crypto fundsnovogratz points out that the grayscale products are subject to high fees  annually for most of the grayscale funds and are subject to wide swings in price that deviate from the underlying assets“if the sec’s job is protecting the little guy that in no way is protecting the little guy they wouldn’t let an etf in the space but they’d let that in the space — where hedge funds arbitrage retail” he sayslarge institutional traders including hedge funds can capitalize on socalled tracking errors which occur when the price of an etf doesn’t match the movement of the underlying assets they have the resources and sophistication to bet on the convergence of these prices — going long one side and shorting the other indeed the grayscale bitcoin trust traded to an alltime high premium of  to the price of bitcoin in may  as bitcoin itself surged above  for the first timebut as interest and liquidity in a security or an entire asset class for that matter grows institutional arbitrage tends to iron out and smooth these wild swings and it’s these very matters relating to the historical volatility of bitcoin and its derivatives that have given the sec pause for greenlighting a crypto fundthe earliest proposed bitcoin funds were in the regulatory pipeline during bitcoin’s meteoric  ascent when it would touch nearly  crypto exchanges were frequently crashing amid the daily  swings at the time the sec objected to the lack of a centralized agreedupon price for bitcoin that a fund could track additionally funds hadn’t worked out a custodial arrangement to safely warehouse the crypto assetsthat’s all changed as standards for crypto prices have emerged along with various custodial regimes such as the new york state bitlicense only today the oldest bank in the us bank of new york mellon announced it’s streamlining its custodial platform to onboard digital assets in addition large companies like telsa visa and paypal are creating network effects as they adopt bitcoin for paymentsbut in the end the sec must sign off — a job that ultimately rests with the incoming chief on gensler novogratz says “i don’t think he’s going to be a pushover for our space at all i think he’s going to be fair”jared blikrie is a correspondent focused on the markets or yahoo finance live follow him spyjaredfollow yahoo finance on twitter facebook
