after tesla announced it has invested  billion in bitcoin and expects to start accepting the cryptocurrency as a payment for its electric vehicles in the near future the bitcoin price went soaring it went from around  to an alltime high of over  in less than  hoursthe price is now up by over  in the first six weeks of  led by elon musk tesla’s investment is obviously in profit already depending on the exact day of the purchase it is likely to be worth over  billion pointing to a paper profit of over  million to put that in context when the electric carmaker made its first ever annual net profit in  it was just over  millionthe bitcoin pricetesla’s move into bitcoin comes on the back of a wave of institutional money invested in the leading cryptocurrency in recent months plus numerous other companies putting it into their treasury reserves with the world’s sixth most valuable company also saying it might buy and hold other digital assets “from time to time or long term” it must be tempting for other major companies to do likewise since the tesla announcement twitter finance director ned segal has already signalled that his company is considering such a move while a research note from the royal bank of canada has made a case for why it would benefit applethe prospect of a bluechip invasion into bitcoin has caused much excitement among cryptocurrency investors but if tesla does trigger such a goldrush there will also be some unsettling consequencesvolatility spillovertesla justified this material change in the way it manages its treasury reserves by stating that investing in bitcoin will “provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximise returns on our cash” corporate treasurers have always used the money markets to invest surplus cash to eke out small yields and it is harder than it used to be in the current longterm low interest rate environmentall the same this is very different to standard money management bitcoin is a highly volatile asset that you would not typically associate with the cash reserves on the balance sheet of a listed company worth close to a trillion us dollars as recently as march  the price dipped below  even in  the price fell more than  before its most recent surgetesla has put almost  of its reserves into the cryptocurrency if apple microsoft facebook twitter and google were to do the same this would translate into almost another  billion investment this is less than  of the total current worth of the bitcoin market but the signal that it would send to other companies and retail investors would likely trigger a bull run that would make the current market look comparably stable some crypto analysts are already predicting that the price will rise to  or even  before  is outsuch a rise would drive up the value of the bitcoin on corporate balance sheets to multiples of what it was at the time of investment tesla’s  allocation may already have gone up to  of the value of its reserves for instance and if it follows through on a potential plan to keep any bitcoins it receives for electric cars instead of converting them into dollars that percentage could rise all the fasterthe problem is the potential effect on company share prices tesla’s share price rose  on the news of the bitcoin investment though it has since fallen by  but a longer term example is canadian tech company microstrategy its share price has ballooned tenfold in value in the past year on the back of a heavy investment into bitcoin but is also down by almost a quarter in the days since the tesla announcementwrit large this could make stock markets far choppier in future – and vulnerable to a nosedive when the bitcoin bull market ends it would be easy to imagine that this could prompt a wider wave of selling as investors sought to cover their lossmaking positions which could be very dangerous for financial stabilitywhat the regulators will doglobal regulators will no doubt be concerned about a potential volatility spillover from digital asset prices into traditional capital markets they may not permit what could quickly amount to effective proxy approval by the back door for companies holding large proportions of a volatile asset on their balance sheetswe have already seen the likes of european central bank president christine lagarde and new us treasury secretary janet yellen calling for more bitcoin regulation in recent weeksthe view from us regulator the sec will be extremely important and it is difficult to predict the response of newly appointed head gary gensler who is himself a crypto expert we may see anything from a waitandsee approach through to a ban on listed companies holding any bitcoinlike assetsbut i would expect that if the price of bitcoin continues towards  there may be a regulatory restriction on the reserve percentage that listed companies can hold in digital assets this would be similar to the us rule that companies cannot buy back more than  of the average daily volume of their own stock such a rule would force companies to sell bitcoin if a price increase meant their holdings broke the maximum level creating a form of sell pressure that the crypto market has not seen beforefor now however bitcoin continues to look like a “buy” asset on the back of the tesla announcement the crypto community will be watching to see whether other major companies follow suit and whether tesla has the conviction to stay invested when its next quarterly announcement comes around but if this trend continues make no mistake that a reckoning will be coming over the prospect of the heady volatility of the crypto market going mainstream watch this space
