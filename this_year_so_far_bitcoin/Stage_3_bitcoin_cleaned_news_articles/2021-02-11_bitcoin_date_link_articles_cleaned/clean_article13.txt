tesla announced that they had invested  in bitcoin and the price duly surged markets are more efficient than many believe and in recent months the bitcoin price has responded positively to known investment flows more than anything else back in the day bitcoin would spike on news that a coffee shop accepted payment in bitcoin or a minor celebrity liked a tweetat the time that made total sense because it was evidence of network adoption and that bitcoin was catching on other examples showed price correlating with the number of addresses wallets and transactions those days are behind us and today it’s all about the moneyin  bitcoin miners will be rewarded with approximately  btc which they will presumably sell most because that is their business in the fourth epoch  halving period postmay  it is easier to sustain higher bitcoin prices than in previous times as the selling pressure has fallen considerably that is why future epochs are bullishhowever to sustain a  btc price that requires  bn of investment flows each year until  after that this falls to  bn coin generation and fee estimate in the  epoch it keeps on falling thereafter meaning that high prices are easier to sustain in the future than todayto put the current runrate of  of annual flows into context the gold etfs attracted  last year in their best year on record as  million ounces were scooped up at an average price of  each the late  weakness in the gold price came about as investors banked profits and headed for the exit in november given the offsetting flows into bitcoin at the time the evidence points towards gold investors switching into bitcoinit has been a good call as the gold investors made it in time for the bitcoin surge if bitcoin can attract  in  as gold did last year expect to see an average bitcoin price of  this is why it is totally rational for the price of bitcoin to bounce to news of inward flowsa milliondollar bitcoini believe there will be a milliondollar bitcoin price you just need to be patient  bn of inflows will easily see a milliondollarbitcoin but not until  add in  average consumer price inflation and that lands in  bolster inflation to  which seems more likely than not and that brings it forward to  is still  years away but a move from today’s price is a huge opportunity with an irr of  with bonds yielding zero and so on you can understand the attraction to sustain a milliondollar bitcoin in the  epoch or even the  would require huge sums of money better to be patient conserve capital and late nature take its coursethis is bitcoin so anything is possible but consider that bitcoin will not always be fed by gold outflows there will be times when they move the other way on the great journey to  i suspect these flows will move back and forth several times don’t forget that a  inflation rate would also likely see gold break  per ounce it’s a much lower return but not one to ignoreone advantage that gold has is that the miners get paid in a very different way you just pay them once for their hard work and they never ask for anything again this model has worked for thousands of years and the miners haven’t complained oncethe comparison between bitcoin and gold is fascinating gold is nice to look at and has remarkable physical properties but is static while bitcoins are dynamic gold is expert at sitting still while bitcoins are buzzing with electrons having followed gold for  years and bitcoin for eight i believe in a balanced approach between these great assetsbitcoin  gold  boldcombining bitcoin and gold is a good solution both assets are longterm stores of value yet they both have their strengths and weaknesses one is volatile the other is calm one is modern the other ancient one requires energy the other does not one has utility while the other has little outside of jewellery above all one is an established monetary asset accepted all over the world whereas the other hopes to catch upwhile both have their pros and cons the bold combination exceeds all expectations there are many different potential bold weighting methodologies our preferred technique is to focus on volatility it has been tried and tested in other asset classes with great success and is simple to implement using  days as our preferred volatility measure gold and bitcoin can be comparedgold and bitcoin volatilitygold has seen volatility consistently below  whereas bitcoin has rarely dipped below  sparing you the details the less volatile asset gets a higher exposure and viceversa which is then rebalanced each month since  this would have seen an average gold exposure of  and bitcoin  the range has seen bitcoin exposure peak at  and trough at  with gold picking up the balancebold asset allocation since having more bitcoin exposure when it has been relatively calm such as  or  has paid dividends having less during the bear markets in  and  successfully reduced risk when it mattered bitcoin has performed best while bold sits neatly in betweenbold delivers the best of both worldshigher rates of compounding are achieved by reducing drawdowns the maximum drawdown for bold has been a tolerable  which is not far below gold itself bold volatility comes out at a highly respectable  which is broadly in line with a company such as microsoft the sharpe ratio a simple measure of riskadjusted returns was  which is remarkablethe bold strategy works because gold and bitcoin behave in different ways despite being monetary assets both will spend time in and out of favour and investment flows will shift between them accordingly if you believe inflation is a risk then simply own bold as it naturally diversifies between the two assets in a simple scalable and logical mannercomparing bitcoin gold and bold to traditional asset classes bold has never been the best nor ever been the worst which makes it attractive in the eyes of asset allocators bold’s worst year was  when it wasn’t much behind european equities emerging markets or oil in most years it has delivered a resounding result and i would expect it to continue to do so for as long as the risk of inflation persistsasset class returns by yearin an inflationary environment the bitcoin versus gold conversation has come to the fore even michael saylor honorary bitcoin head of sales supports institutions to allow both asset classes to be held on their balance sheets we believe this makes sense because volatility matters as a profit or loss must be recognised in a company’s financial statementsbold jumps off the page as the asset for the next decade it spices up gold while derisking bitcoin this is why bytetreecom and bytetree asset management have decided to specialise in this field over the coming weeks expect to see some new
