the last  months have been marked by unprecedented volatility and uncertainty for the stock market the benchmark sp  set a record for both the steepest bear market decline and quickest bounceback rally to new highs from a bear market low in however one asset has been largely unfazed by this uncertainty bitcoinbitcoin euphoria has pushed it to record heightsthe worlds largest cryptocurrency had nearly quadrupled on a trailingyear basis through early morning jan   this blows the nearly  return for the sp  over the same time frame out of the watermost bitcoin enthusiasts will point to its scarcity utility and gamechanging potential as the reasons behind its surge in valuein terms of scarcity a maximum of  million bitcoin will be mined with approximately  million tokens already in circulation itll take nearly  more years before the final  million tokens are mined bitcoin hodlers ie those who buy and hold bitcoin view this fixed supply as a hedge against the everballooning money supply of the us dollaras for utility more merchants than ever are accepting bitcoin as a form of payment according to fundera there are now more than  bitcoin atms worldwide with north of  global businesses accepting the most popular digital currency as paymentbitcoins blockchain ie the underlying ledger responsible for transparently and immutably recording transactions is also viewed as a gamechanger in the financial landscape with the ability to process and settle transactions in mere minutes the idea of waiting a week for overseas payments to settle could be long gonebitcoin is now in a bear market and it could stay there for a whilebut in spite of all of the euphoria surrounding bitcoin it hasnt stopped the worlds most popular digital currency from falling into bear market territory a bear market describes an asset thats declined at least  from a recent high in bitcoins case its fallen by  since hitting an alltime closing high on jan historically emotions and technical analysis ie pretty charts are what have driven bitcoins shorterterm movements pull up a chart since bitcoins inception and youll see that these parabolic moves are always followed by protracted periods of decline and lost interest by investors in plain english this bear market likely signals the potential for a long and protracted move lower by bitcoinof course its not just emotions and fancy pointandfigure charting that have me believing the worlds top digital currency is headed lower my dislike of bitcoin as an investment is based on the leading cryptocurrencys many flawsbitcoins scarcity is based on uncertain promisesthe first issue with bitcoin is the false perception of scarcityi often hear from bitcoin supporters that since we dont know how much gold there is on planet earth but we do know theres a  millionbitcoin token limit bitcoin is the best example of a scarce asset but this thinking is completely backwards the amount of gold that exists on planet earth no matter what the tally is all therell ever be were talking about a physical lineinthesand form of scarcitymeanwhile bitcoins scarcity is contrived from the idea that community consensus wont be reached to increase the token count while that is a possible outcome for bitcoin its far from a line in the sand bitcoins scarcity amounts to nothing more than the perception of a promise that the community wont raise the token limit theres nothing concrete about thatbitcoins utility is blowing smoke not gathering steamwhile bitcoin has had no trouble generating plenty of trading volume due to its wild volatility its not exactly been the medium of exchange that it was originally designed to be the us has  million businesses with at least one employee according to the us census bureau yet per fundera only  us businesses accept bitcoin thats hardly a blipfurthermore the vast majority of bitcoin are held by a small percentage of funds and large investors most of these tokens arent going to find their way into general circulation for payments and spending purposes even with the ability to divide bitcoin tokens down to eight decimal places theres simply not enough of it to become a gamechanging form of paymentthe barrier to entry is virtually nonexistentanother overlooked flaw with bitcoin is that theres truly nothing unique or proprietary that makes it the clear and obvious choice for digital payments or investors for example more than  blockchain companies were formed in china alone last year it simply takes time and money to develop blockchain technology that may well prove superior to what bitcoin offerswhats more bitcoins blockchain strictly pertains to expediting payments and settlements in other words it has financial applications ethereum on the other hand has more realworld applications with its blockchain including executable smart contracts with its underlying ledgeras the icing on the cake were seeing blockchain developed that may operate with fiat currencies or perhaps with no tokenscurrency whatsoeverthe bitcoin fairy tale is full of holes and continues to be driven by nothing more than emotional traders and pretty charts with those charts not looking so pretty anymore bitcoins fundamental flaws will rise to the forefront and worsen its young bear market
