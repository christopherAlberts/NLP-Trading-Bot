the australia letter is a weekly newsletter from our australia bureau sign up to get it by email this week’s issue is written by yan zhuang and damien cave from the australia bureauwhat happens when a country’s politicians can’t agree on the color of the skyin the midst of all that’s been happening in the united states australia’s acting prime minister michael mccormack — filling in for prime minister scott morrison who is on holiday — recently defended the right of parliamentarian colleagues to spread misinformation on social media about the coronavirus and the american election by making this comparison“you might look out there and say the sky is blue and i can see from here that it’s gray” he told local journalists “if we go out from under this rotunda there are probably blue patches”clearly as the fallout to last week’s white house siege last week continues in the united states with donald trump making history as the first american president to be impeached twice its effects are also being felt overseasand in australia where the conservative government has been cozying up to president trump for years and stopped short of directly criticizing him over the white house violence the president’s suspension from social media platforms seems to have led his allies to issue a surprisingly vocal defense of the right to say whatever you want on social media even if it’s not true or so close to untrue as to be a bit absurdmr mccormack seemed to be saying that if there is a tiny patch of blue however fleeting that gives someone the right to say it was a beautiful clear and sunny day
