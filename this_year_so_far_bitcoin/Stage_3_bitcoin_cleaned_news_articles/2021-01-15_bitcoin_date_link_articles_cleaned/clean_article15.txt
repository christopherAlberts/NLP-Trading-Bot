in the contest between mutual funds and exchangetraded funds investors have been voting with their wallets lately for etfs now at least three fund issuers intend to convert some of their mutual funds to etfsetfs can be traded all day like stocks as their prices rise and fall they often have lower costs and result in lower tax bills than mutual funds dobut mutual funds which are priced only once a day may be more stable in some respects during a twoweek period in march when the markets became volatile bond etfs traded at huge discounts to their net asset value or nav which is the pershare value of the fund’s holdings that means that if you wanted to sell your fund in the middle of the turmoil you would have faced even steeper losses than the market decline warrantedbond etfs usually trade at prices close to the nav but during the socalled pandemic panic some major bond etfs traded at discounts of  percent or more before recovering in april partly because of mutual funds’ onceaday pricing their investors didn’t face the same problems
