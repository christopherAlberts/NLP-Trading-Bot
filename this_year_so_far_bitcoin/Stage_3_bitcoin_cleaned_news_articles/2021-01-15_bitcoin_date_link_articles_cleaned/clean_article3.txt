read story transcriptstefan thomas is a bitcoin millionaire or he would be if only he could remember his passwordthe san francisco software developer and ceo was an early adopter of bitcoin back in  he produced an animated video explaining how the digital currency works for his efforts a bitcoin enthusiast awarded him  bitcoinslater that year he lost the password to his ironkey the usb hard drive that contains the digital wallet that holds his bitcoins since then the currencys value has skyrocketed and thomas holdings are worth  million us  million cdnthe ironkey gives users  password guesses before it encrypts its contents permanently and thomas bitcoin is lost forever he has two guesses lefthere is part of his conversation with as it happens host carol offstefan how is it possible that one measly little password stands between you and hundreds of millions of dollarsyeah its a really good question isnt itok this happens right we all know we lose our passwords and so a little thing comes up when were going to our bank or whatever  did you forget your password and then you push it and then you go through a business of changing your password so thats not available to youno bitcoin is a decentralized system and so if you hold your bitcoins like i did in a completely independent wallet — so not with an exchange not with a bank not with any kind of institution but yourself — then its just like cash its like gold if you lose it you lose it theres no recovery process for thatsince then a lot of people have come up with all kinds of clever solutions like you know metal wallets where you can put down your secret keys and things like that but most of that didnt exist back then back then you had to kind of come up with your own solution and apparently i didnt do a very good job of thati tried everything i would stay up all night trying different ideas for how to recover it or just like staring at the ceiling for hours  stefan thomas software developerwe know that this has been a very good year for bitcoin how many people do you think are not able to access their fortunesin the new york times article about this they had an estimate which was something like  locked up in these wallets and so you can imagine its probably hundreds of thousands if not millions of people who are in my situationbut i think they said it was  per cent of all the bitcoin accounts are owned by people who cant access them yeah i think a good chunk of that especially like some of the larger ones were very early wallets so you know at the time it might have been less moneyin my case it was   cdn which for me was a huge amount — like an incomprehensible amount even then but of course you know once you cant access it and the price goes up the number just gets bigger and biggera visual representation of the cryptocurrency bitcoin dan kitwoodgetty imagesso what is it like for you i mean how many sleepless nights do you have thinking about the fact that you have  million that you cant get atafter i realized i lost the coins i was completely destroyed like when i think back to that its hard to even wrap my head around how i felt that those couple of weeksand i tried everything i would stay up all night trying different ideas for how to recover it or just like staring at the ceiling for hours you know just what you imagine you would do if you lost that sort of moneyand then after a couple of weeks of that i got to a point where i started to realize that the chances of recovery were not very good and well get into you know what that last little glimmer of hope is in a momentso i sort of had to make a decision right like either i let this define the rest of my life and i keep thinking back to it and i just you know like you said lose sleep for the rest of my life or i just you know face the fact that this money is gone these bitcoins are gone and i move forward and i get back to work and i chose the latterok so whats the last glimmer of hopethe famous usb stick with the  triesthere is a way to take a scanning electron microscope and take apart the physical chip and literally go into the the silicon chip and take away layer by layer like a few atoms thick and then read out the actual memory cells and then with that technique you should be able to bypass that limit of  tries and then you can have a supercomputer try you know billions of passwords per secondnow the problem is that first of all that requires a specialized laboratory its very expensive only a few people in the world can do it and even then its kind of high risk it could just fail and then the chip is destroyed and you dont get a second tryback then it definitely wasnt worth it i think now it probably is worth it but it still requires a lot of organizing and logistics and even then its not guaranteednow that this has been in the news im getting lots and lots of people reaching out some of whom are the types of people who have access to that kind of equipment and the kind of expertise needed and so im talking to them to see you know if we should attempt a recovery and like what it would cost etceteraso what happens i mean hundreds of millions of dollars are now sort of locked up  where does it go who gets itbecause im not selling those bitcoins that means that theres a little bit less supply in the market  and so potentially the price is infinitesimally higher rightother holders in theory profit although you have to imagine like because of this risk maybe there are people that maybe dont invest in bitcoin because theyre worried about this and so maybe that kind of makes up for it and kind of that reduces the price so again thats probably almost a better question for an economist to opine onthere are those who are saying that this now just belies the value of investing in this kind of bitcoin for all the advantages it has that you dont have to deal with institutions and governments that obviously it has its pitfalls and so are you one of those are you one of the people who think that maybe this kind of currency is not a good ideathis experience has definitely changed my opinion about bitcoin in terms of i was one of those people that was very excited about you know everyone can be their own bank and that sort of thingi know theres lots of bitcoin experts listening right now saying that this could never happen to me but for me personally like i kind of was very humbled by that experiencenowadays my belief is that i think its really nice that we live in a free country where we can have the choice and we can hold our own bitcoins if we want to and i think thats a right that i would fight for preserving there have been some discussions in the us about maybe not allowing that in the future and i think thats something im absolutely againstbut at the same time i think that as a practical matter for most people its probably better to hold their bitcoins with a custodian like an institution that specializes in securing and storing bitcoinswritten by sheena goodyear interview produced by chloe shantzhilkes qa has been edited for length and clarity
