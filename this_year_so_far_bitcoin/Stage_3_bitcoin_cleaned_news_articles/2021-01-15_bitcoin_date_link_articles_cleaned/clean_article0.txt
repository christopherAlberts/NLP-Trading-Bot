bitcoin prices are on the rise notwithstanding a recent bout of weakness but experts interviewed by marketwatch caution that although it may feel inevitable an exchangetraded fund backed by a digitalcurrency may not be seen as quickly as enthusiasts might hope“the sec appears to have a very high bar to clear tied to market manipulation and custody audit” todd rosenbluth head of etf and mutual fund research at cfra research told marketwatch in emailed comments on fridayfresh talk of an etf backed by a digital asset like bitcoin or an alternative comes amid a surge in institutional interest in the value of the overall complex of virtual assets the value of digital currencies hit a record at  trillion earlier this month as bitcoin prices btcusd  surged to an alltime high at  according to coindeskspeculation around the prospects for an investment fund that would be more accessible to individual investors also comes as wall street’s top cop the securities and exchange commission is set to be headed by a veritable bitcoin expert gary gensler a former head of the commodity futures trading commission and a professor of cryptocurrencies at massachusetts institute of technologypresidentelect joe biden on monday tapped gensler to serve as sec chairman with his knowledge of cryptos gensler would pair well with hester peirce an sec commissioner who has become a vocal advocate for digital assets and who is affectionately referred to as “crypto mom” by bitcoin bullshowever hope that gensler and peirce might fasttrack a muchhopedfor bitcoin fund with an etf wrapper may be a bit premature at least in the near term experts said“as the infrastructure around  grows we expect an etf to come to market eventually but it is unclear when and we are skeptical it will be in ” rosenbluth told marketwatchsince  a bitcoin etf has been a virtual holy grail for fans of digital assets with the aim of providing individual investors easier access to bitcoins at a low cost and in etf wrapperto be sure an etf sponsored by van eck securities corp and solidx management offers qualified investors mostly hedge funds and wealthy investors access to a bitcoinbacked trust but that offering failed to meet hopes for a fund that delivered cryptos to the massesjan van eck chief executive of a family firm founded several decades ago bearing his name told marketwatch in an interview earlier this week that he’s still intent on making a bitcoin etf a reality despite past rejection by the sec“we’re going to keep trying” he said “the way the regulations work is you file you have conversations with the sec and if it looks like you’re not going to get approved you pull your application” he saidrosenbluth estimates that about seven firms over the years have tried and failed to get clearance for a digitalcurrency etf — including gemini founded in  by tyler and cameron winklevossmuch has changed for bitcoin and its ilk over the years with a wave of institutional investor interest in the sector helping to foster a fresh rally in coins and renewed hope for products that offer a wider array of investors accesshowever lingering questions about infrastructure in a market that didn’t exist until  and arguably not until years after the first bitcoins were digital minted have given regulators reason to slow play a crypto etf“in general the sec is concerned about market manipulation they’re concerned about custody and then i think they’re just concerned about the maturity of the market” van eck saidamy lynch a former sec examiner and president and founder at consultant frontline compliance said that the question of how to value bitcoins and other cryptos may be the biggest issue for regulatorsit trades “purely on speculation as opposed to a real value denominator” lynch said“in order to price a security” if bitcoins and other assets are deemed as such “in a methodical way it has to be pegged to something priced in a repeatable standardized way” lynch saidthe frontline consultant said that the inability to price cryptos makes them more vulnerable to manipulation and harder to regulate“price stability comes from being able to effectively value it in a proven and repeatable and standardized method” she said“the question is always what’s the price” van eck also noted “you have to have a completely trustworthy infrastructure” he explainedbloomberg news on friday that gensler may be inclined to take a firm look at bitcoins and the cypto complex“if it gets broad adoption if we really think the crypto world is going to be part of the future it needs to come inside of public policy envelope” bloomberg quoted gensler saying in a  interviewthat sort of talk may be grist for the bulls who see it as an implicit nod to the eventuality of a digitalcurrency etf“i do think  has knowledge and interest in that space” said frontline compliance’s lynchshe cautioned however that pursuing an etf may not be a high priority for gensler should he be nominated“it is not a question of if it is a question of when” said michael sonnenshein managing director at grayscale one of the largest managers of cryptocurrencies via the grayscale bitcoin trust gbtc  and similar ethereumfocused investment entitiessonnenshein said that the market infrastructure has evolved significantly from three years ago when there was a retailfueled fervor that was capped by an epic collapse in bitcoin’s price in early lynch said that she doesn’t doubt that an etf will happen but warns that the sec may have larger priorities at hand“i agree that it isn’t a question of if but when but it will take time and it’s not going to happen in early days of his role in the sec” lynch said“this is going to take a lot of time and effort” the former sec examiner saidand in the end even if a bitcoin etf does come to pass it may be a problem at least in the early days for the market as investors pour out of investments like grayscale and into new lowcosts alternatives speculated jpmorgan chase  co analysts in a jan  research report“a cascade of gbtc outflows and a collapse of its premium would likely have negative nearterm implications for bitcoin given the flow and signaling important of gbtc” the jpm analysts wrotemeanwhile investors will have to turn to grayscale and other bitcoinadjacent assets like mining stocks
