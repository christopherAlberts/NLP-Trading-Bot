the idea that much of today’s cash use will shift to digital tokens is neither faddish nor outlandish as long as you don’t start equating the future of money with bitcoin sure governments will borrow some elements of the distributed ledger technology behind private cryptocurrencies but they will very much want to retain control of what circulates as money in their economies some will succeeddon’t be surprised if by the end of the current decade the ewallet on your smartphone resembles a multicurrency account but instead of dealing with commercial banks you may be a customer of central banks several of them in factsound farfetched apart from the bahamian sand dollar  there’s no official online currency in mass circulation yet still digital yuan pilots are gathering pace as beijing aims for a possible rollout coinciding with the  winter olympics sweden may be the next major nation to follow suit the bank of japan has no immediate plans but it acknowledges the possibility “of a surge in public demand” for official digital cash going forwardeven in the united states which is only toying with the concept digital payment vehicles that don’t rely on traditional bank accounts can increase financial inclusion among cash users according to a september  paper by federal reserve bank of atlanta president raphael bostic and others treasury secretary janet yellen says a digital dollar is “absolutely worth looking at”once china and the us are both in the fray virtual money is bound to become a tool for wielding global influence by carving up the world into new currency blocs that’s because any token will have dual uses outside the issuing nation’s borders the dollar or yuan that pops up in a phone wallet in indonesia or india — backed by a solemn promise of taxpayers in the us or china — could be used for buying goods services or assets internationallyjust as easily this new money can end up replacing domestic currency in people’s daily lives although this is no different from traditional dollarization that occurs in countries plagued by inflation and exchange rate volatility the convenience and accessibility of central bankissued digital cash could enable “substitution at a faster pace and larger scale” according to tao zhang a deputy managing director at the imfto stay in control of monetary policy  authorities in smaller economies will need their tokens to be attractive in domestic situations the goal for bigger nations may be different china and the us may want to offer addons that make the ecny or the fedcoin the preferred choice for foreigners in settling international claimsan efficient future will be one in which all central banks’ digital currencies are interoperable in other words they’ll interact with one another — and with privatesector alternatives including bitcoin says sky guo the chief executive of cypherium the us enterprise blockchain startup is a member of the fed’s faster payments council and of the digital monetary institute of the official monetary and financial institutions forum or omfif a central banking think tankguo is working on the challenges that will arise when sovereign money gets digitized how to process high volumes of transactions quickly cheaply and with a strong consensus among registries updated automatically across a network how to give people a sense of privacy in everyday payments even after the anonymity of cash is lostcentral banks will have to make choices not all smartphones can run advanced virtual machines effortlessly executing the software code for automated contracts choose the wrong technology and the unbanked population might once again get excluded ditto for overseas remittances a  trillionayear opportunity for tokens to replace an expensive network of correspondent banks moving money by exchanging swift messages but it won’t work for small transfers if the computing power to verify transactions in a decentralized network costs too muchthe ideal technology doesn’t necessarily have to be a blockchain but it should be something “lightweight flexible and capable of working with legacy systems” guo says above all the distributed ledger must be transparentthere will be other obstacles “a driving force for lobbying against central bank digital currencies has been established among payment processing giants like paypal venmo and stripe” guo tells me “fedcoin won’t need these intermediaries to send funds as these companies fall victim to innovation it’ll be interesting to see how they try to protect themselves from disruption”paypal holdings inc which owns the persontoperson service venmo contests guos assertion as false supporting and distributing central bank digital currencies is part of paypals vision of an inclusive future chief executive officer dan schulman told investors last month former bank of england governor mike carney who has proposed an alternative to the dollar through a network of central bank digital currencies recently joined the board of stripe incone way to resolve the tension may be to coopt the private sector as imf economists tobias adrian and tommaso mancinigriffoli have argued an official virtual currency could be like apple’s ios operating system with commercial banks and emoney providers running apps on top of it the apple health app may be fine for a lay user an athlete will want something more sophisticated money could go the same waycountries will also have to cooperate with one another take mcbdc bridge the project for  crossborder remittances using central bank digital currencies was begun by the hong kong monetary authority and the bank of thailand but has now been joined by the central bank of the united arab emirates and the people’s bank of chinamany emergingmarket central banks might think that to retain control of their nations’ money they must chain the population to using a single virtual token — the one they’ve issued but that may simply encourage mass migration to private cryptocurrencies that are pegged to legal tender and therefore less volatile diem as the formerly facebook incbacked libra project is now known could be one such stablecoinsovereign currency issuers will have to think of themselves less as lords and masters and more as service providers in a free market of digital cash after all they’ll be pushing their products into crowded wallets and hoping that we like them more than a rival offering from another central bank those that lose the plot might lose their citizens’ loyalty
