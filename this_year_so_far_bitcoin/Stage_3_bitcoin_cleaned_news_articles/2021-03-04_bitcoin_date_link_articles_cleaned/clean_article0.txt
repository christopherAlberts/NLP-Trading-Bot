bill gates fresh off making headlines for suggesting the world should eat  percent synthetic beef is now beefing with a new target bitcoingates the microsoft cofounder and chair of the investment fund breakthrough energy ventures recently said in a livestreamed clubhouse session that bitcoin guzzles up a concerning amount of energy➡ join pop mech pro to get exclusive answers to your burning science questions“bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind and so it’s not a great climate thing” gates told cnbc’s andrew ross sorkin you can hear gates’s comments on bitcoin starting around the  mark in the video belowthis content is imported from youtube you may be able to find the same content in another format or you may be able to find more information at their web sitein the broad sense gates isn’t making an especially egregious claim a quick refresher bitcoin is a cryptocurrency—a shared encrypted publicly available form of money made by building links in a longer and longer blockchain code blockchain refers to the collective record called a ledger that stores cryptocurrency transactions like a communal excel spreadsheetthis content is imported from embedname you may be able to find the same content in another format or you may be able to find more information at their web sitethis record is stored on volunteers’ computers which run software that verifies transactions checking to make sure that both parties agreed to the change and the buyer has enough currency to honor it these volunteers are called miners and the reward for volunteering their hardware is kickbacks in the form of more cryptocurrencyif enough computers conclude that yes this is a valid exchange that verification joins the rest of the world’s recent transactions as a “block” to prevent people from generating counterfeit currency the math required to verify a transaction takes so much computing power that no one user or group could do it“bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind”  bill gatespeople “mine” bitcoin then by tasking computers to process complicated math usually in the background on real users’ computers or even on dedicated machines miners use highend graphics cards or gpus because these pieces of hardware are already made to churn through computer math as quickly as possible and with a lot of calculations running at the same time like a highway with more lanes this reduces congestion and travel time it also heats up your pc usually requiring highend fans to matchgear we love

recently built an interactive analysis tool to calculate the real energy cost of bitcoin cryptocurrency using their energy use model the researchers found that bitcoin mining uses more energy each year  terrawat hours  than the entire country of argentina  twhaccording to the bbc cambridge’s tool also ranked bitcoin’s electricity consumption above that of the netherlands  twh and the united arab emirates  twh the tool counts mining activity and crossreferences users’ locations to make a heat map of energy use by all bitcoin minersuniversity of cambridgein response industry researchers have pushed back claiming bitcoin uses just  percent of digital tech emissions while that’s a fair claim no one is making anyone use bitcoin compared with technology usage that underlies infrastructure for example or public utilities what if just one optional transaction each year used  percent of the total by itself where do we draw the linethis content is imported from twitter you

industriesthe total ghg emissions from digital tech are estimated to  with bitcoin contributing to roughly  of thedigital tech emissions  — arcane research arcaneresearch february  “i haven’t chosen to invest in bitcoin” gates said during the clubhouse interview “i buy malaria vaccines i buy measles vaccines i invest in companies that make products”that’s all true but gates uses “digital money” with his global foundation“there are other ways of doing digital currency that our foundation is involved with which are done in local currency the transactions are not secret they’re reversible you can’t use it for ransom or things like that and yet the transaction fees are so low that it’s empowering the poorest”what’s the difference here exactlywhat gates describes is an almost utopian closed economy where sustainable businesses can exchange digital currency of a select type think about something like loyalty program rewards or airplane frequent flyer miles where you belong to an “in group” that entitles you to certain benefitsgates wants to direct this same style of structure toward the global poor for whom using digital currency could remove structural barriers debilitating transaction fees and other overhead costs think about a radical new system where people applying to college never have to pay an application fee for example or countries where citizens don’t typically pay services to file their own taxeshow is this different from cryptocurrency which is also digital well the idea of digital currency doesn’t ever necessarily include the portion with the “hash” of extremely large number arithmetic—that’s the crypto part of cryptocurrency simply making a digital currency means for example the ingame currencies in huge games like fortnite along with programs like the ones gates aspires to put in place around the world it’s a format like paper moneythe kind of digital currency gates is pursuing with his foundation doesn’t sound like cryptocurrency gates also seems to believe bitcoin is used for illegal activity in a way other digital currencies aren’t he’s not wrong but again cash has been the king of illegal activity for thousands of years that doesn’t mean paper currency is inherently badgates is right to remain skeptical of bitcoin because it makes sense to take a critical view of any kind of speculative investment—especially when so many people don’t seem to understand what bitcoin even is gates also has a personal investment in other kinds of digital currencies he’s not a luddite making criticisms with no stakeby warning smaller investors to keep their eyes peeled gates seems to be trying to educate consumers and advise caution🎥 now watch thisadditional reporting by alexander georgethis content is created and maintained by a third
