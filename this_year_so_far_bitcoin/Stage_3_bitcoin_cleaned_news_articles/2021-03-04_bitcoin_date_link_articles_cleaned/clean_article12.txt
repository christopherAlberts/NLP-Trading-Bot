with huge batteries good cameras and even some that run stock android its difficult to find a good allrounder in the entrylevel segment but there are some phones that do come close the new narzo  from realme claims to offer a good balance of features and performance at an affordable price pointshould you stop your search and buy this one instead here is my review of the realme narzo realme narzo  designlets start with the design the most affordable smartphone in the realme narzo  series today looks fresh and has a different design compared to its predecessors at the back the realme narzo  has a dual pattern of sorts with the bottom twothirds having diagonal lines while the upper section is plain the pattern looks good and helps you grip the smartphone easily realme has used a squareshaped camera module that reminded me of the realme narzo  review you also get a rearmounted fingerprint scanner that is wellpositioned and easy to reach the sidemounted power and volume buttons are conveniently placed toothe realme narzo  gets a decently big  display with a tall  aspect ratio the tall display requires some finger stretching to reach the top of the screen the sim tray is on the left side of the frame and has two nanosim slots and a dedicated slot for storage expansionthe realme narzo  is noticeably thicker because of the big  batterypick the smartphone up and you will notice that isnt the lightest device around tipping the scales at  the realme narzo  is noticeably heavy realme has used rounded sides to mask the thickness of the device which also helps to grip the smartphone better the upside of this slightly bulky phone is that it packs in a big  battery which helps it deliver good battery life more on that in a bitthe realme narzo  has a usb typec port a  headphone jack and the loudspeaker at the bottom it comes with a bundled  charger in the box which is a good addition at this price the realme narzo  is available in two colour options lazer black and lazer blue and i have the latter for this reviewrealme narzo  specifications and softwarerealme has stepped up its game with the narzo  as it gets a significant upgrade compared to the realme narzo  you get a more powerful mediatek helio  soc thats paired with either  or  of  ram depending on which variant you choose these variants are paired with  and  of storage respectively storage is expandable further upto  using a microsd card realme has priced the smartphone quite aggressively at rs  for the base variant while the higher variant is priced at rs the realme narzo  supports dualband wifi ac bluetooth  and three satellite navigation systems it runs realme ui  based on android  realme is promising an update to realme ui  soonyou get realme ui  on top of android since the realme narzo  still uses the older android skin i found the interface very easy to use there are a fair amount of bloatware apps preinstalled but you can uninstall most of them without any issues i did not encounter any spammy notifications from the stock apps eitherrealme narzo  performancethe realme narzo  worked very well for daily use and could also handle occasional gaming quite well if this is what your typical usage pattern looks like then the phone should not disappoint the rearmounted fingerprint scanner was quick at authentication and face recognition too did not need more than a single attempt to unlock the smartphone the realme narzo  has an hd resolution display which is acceptable for the price segment i found the display to be good indoors but it was strictly average when used outdoors under direct lighti ran benchmarks on the realme narzo  to see where it stands compared to the rest of the competition in antutu the narzo  scored  points while returning  points in pcmarks work  test suite in geekbench  singlecore and multicore tests it scored  and  points respectively in gfxbench the smartphone managed  and  in trex and car chase tests respectivelythe dualcamera setup on the narzo  sports a  camera and a portrait lensi did play call of duty mobile on the realme narzo  to see how it fares the game defaulted to the low graphics settings with the framerate set to medium the game was playable at these settings without any lag i played the game for  minutes and noticed a three percent drop in the battery level which is acceptable the phone was slightly warm to the touch but nothing alarmingbattery life on the realme narzo  was excellent and the phone managed to last for two days before needing to be plugged in with my typical usage in our hd video loop test the phone ran for  hours and  minutes which is incredibly good if you bingewatch lots of video content on your phone the narzo  can be the ideal partner the  charger in the box can charge the narzo  to  percent in half an hour and up to  percent in an hour keep in mind that even with this fast charger it still takes a good two and half hours to fully charge the batteryrealme narzo  camerasthe realme narzo  sports a  primary camera and a monochrome portrait camera with an unspecified resolution at the front it has an  camera for selfies the camera app has remained unchanged and finding the right setting wasnt too difficult there are multiple shooting modes available along with a camera ai that can automatically tune the colour settings based on the scene or object youre pointing atrealme narzo  daylight camera sample tap to see larger imagein daylight the photos taken by the realme narzo  looked good on the phones display but i noticed lower details upon magnifying the image text with large fonts at a distance was legible but the overall image lacked good sharpness there is a â€˜chroma boost toggle that increases the contrast slightly and improves details in the shadowsrealme narzo  closeup camera sample tap to see larger imagerealme narzo  portrait camera sample tap to see larger imagecloseups clicked in adequate light were good and the phone managed a soft bokeh effect for the background the realme narzo  occasionally struggled to focus on smaller objects in my experience portrait shots turned out quite well with good edge detection you also get the option to set the level of blur before you take the shotrealme narzo  lowlight camera sample tap to see larger imagerealme narzo  night mode camera sample tap to see larger imagelowlight camera performance was below average and the phone took over two seconds to take a shot in the regular photo mode the output lacked detail in the shadows and the slower shutter speed introduced motion blur in the output there is night mode as well in the camera app which takes over four seconds to take a shot this mode compensates for hand shakes and photos generally had better colours but it did not do much to improve details in the shadowsrealme narzo  selfie portrait camera sample tap to see larger imagerealme narzo  lowlight portrait selfie camera sample tap to see larger imageselfies from the realme narzo  were good and the phone managed good images in daylight as well as low light video recording tops out at  for the primary camera and lacks stabilisation resulting in a shaky footage i found the quality to be strictly average during the day with weaker details when shooting at night or in low lightverdictrealme has priced the narzo  under rs  which should make it accessible to a lot of people looking for a decent device on a tight budget the smartphone offers good overall performance for the price which is more than adequate for general use and a bit of occasional gaming i found the battery performance to be excellent which is one of the biggest highlights of this smartphonecamera performance is not the best ive seen at this price point although it does manage to take good selfies barring this major hurdle i think the realme narzo  is still a good pick for the price if software and cameras are of importance to you then the moto  plus review is one alternative you
