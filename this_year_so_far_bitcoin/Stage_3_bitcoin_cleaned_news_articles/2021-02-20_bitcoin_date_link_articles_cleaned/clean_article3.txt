earlier this week bitcoin cryptobtc the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap hit a milestone it handily topped the psychological  level as i write this on feb  its closing in on a market value of  trillion about  billion awaybitcoin has gotten an extra bump in recent weeks from a handful of brandname companies adding it to their balance sheets or accepting it as a form of payment tesla nasdaqtsla purchased  billion worth of bitcoin to add to its balance sheet with enterprise software company microstrategy buying in excess of  billion worth of tokens in decembereven the motley fool has decided to purchase  million worth of bitcoin to add to its balance sheetbut at the motley fool we strongly believe in understanding both sides to every investment personally i dont think highly of bitcoin i have  reasons why ill never buy it for my portfolio its scarcity is a mythbitcoin optimists often cite its  million token limit with  million bitcoin already in circulation itll take close to  more years before the remaining  million are mined and put into circulation the argument is that bitcoins fixed token count will help fight against the ongoing devaluation of the us dollar as the money supply expandsthe flaw in this thesis is that bitcoins scarcity is nothing more than an illusion while unlikely community consensus could decide at some point in the future to increase bitcoins token count without any physical scarcity to speak of a promise is all that keeps its token count from rising its realworld utility is minimalthough companies like tesla are adding fuel to the bitcoin craze the reality is that its not exactly a preferred form of payment an analysis from business funding company fundera found that approximately  us businesses accept bitcoin there are more than  million businesses in the us including soleproprietorships and about  million that employ at least one other person after a decade bitcoin has hardly made a dent on the utility frontalso dont forget that a vast majority of tokens arent actually in circulation investors are holding on to them which further limits bitcoins ability to be a medium of exchange the barrier to entry is almost nonexistentwant to start your own digital token if youve got money and time on your hands you can create your own digital currency with tethered blockchain the barrier to entry in the crypto space is exceptionally low meaning there could be dozens of superior alternatives to bitcoin or its blockchain in development or available for use having virtually no barrier to entry suggests that bitcoins firstmover advantage isnt a selling point its difficult to shortsell which leads to inefficient marketsin recent weeks retail investors who also happen to be the core fans of bitcoin have been in an allout war with shortsellers  ie investors who profit when the price of a security falls some even view shortsellers as evil but shortselling is a natural part of the investing cycle that helps lead to price discoverybitcoin is really difficult to shortsell on most platforms which means were not getting anywhere near a true price discovery this market inefficiency is one of the reasons bitcoin is so exceptionally volatile it isnt even the best option among financial networksbitcoins network has been touted as a game changer for financial payments rather than using traditional banking networks and waiting up to one week for payment to be validated and settled bitcoin can do so in an average of  minuteshowever bitcoins usage is strictly limited to the payments side of the equation and its not even the best network at what it does in the financial space stellar cryptoxlm can settle validate and settle financial transactions in mere seconds with its lumens coin meanwhile ethereum cryptoeth provides nonfinancial blockchain applications with the addition of smart contracts  commands that are executable once all predetermined conditions are met once again bitcoin may have firstmover advantage but its not the most innovative or functional kid on the block by a long shot blockchain has been an enterprise bust thus fardont overlook that the bitcoin story is really about advancing its underlying digital ledger known as blockchain with blockchain transactions can be validated and stored forever in a transparent and immutable waywhile there are plenty of applications for blockchain on paper we havent seen these ideas translate into realworld functionality businesses have been unwilling to replace their proven network infrastructure with untested blockchain technology creating something of a  coindesk reported that tech stalwart ibm nyseibm practically dismantled its blockchain division according to four people familiar with the matterin short enterprise blockchain has been a gigantic flop thus far storage and security issues are worrisomethis is a bit more personal but i have no desire to deal with the complexities of storing and protecting bitcoin from hackers bitcoin must be stored in a digital wallet kept on a hardwarebased platform or on the web either way it can be far less secure than most folks realizean estimated  billion worth of crypto tokens including at least  bitcoins were stolen in the first five months of  according to ciphertrace youll get absolutely no protection from the federal deposit insurance corporation either the tax situation can be burdensomeif you think you hate doing your taxes now try getting involved with bitcoin since the internal revenue service views cryptocurrency as property all dispositions must be accounted for via capital gains and losses youll have to report more than just buying and selling bitcoin if you purchase bitcoin and sell it to buy another cryptocurrency or a goodservice youll have to report your cost basis and disposition price it sounds burdensome especially if youre using bitcoin to buy goods and services its driven purely by emotions and technical analysisthere are only two true drivers to bitcoins value investor emotions and technical analysis ie pretty charts neither of these is a particularly intriguing reason to buy in especially since neither will help over the long runfear of missing out fomo and cheerleading from the likes of tesla ceo elon musk have fueled this record run higher in bitcoin as noted earlier utility remains poor scarcity is a myth and the barrier to entry is virtually nonexistent what were seeing is day traders having a field day and thats not something i want my money in history is undefeatedfinally history is undefeated when it comes to nextbigthing investment bubbles bursting you can look back more than a quarter of a century to the birth of the internet businesstobusiness commerce genomics  printing marijuana and even blockchain no matter what the next great advancement was the bubble eventually burst these trends did eventually produce winners but history suggests that parabolic moves in assets tied to nextbigthing trends arent sustainablefor these  reasons i dont plan to invest in bitcoin
