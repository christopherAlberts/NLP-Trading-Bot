our daily newsletter  things before the opening bellas bitcoin continues its meteoric rise breaching new records and crossing the  trillion market capitalization mark in just the last week more investors are assessing the longstanding comparison between the famous cryptocurrency and an equally wellknown asset class goldboth assets experts say are often seen as ways to diversify a portfolio or as a hedge against fiat currency inflation brought about by what some observers see as unsustainable fiscal and monetary policiesyet until recently it was rare to see wall street analysts chief executives or established investors seriously compare the two assets bitcoin commonly referred to as digital gold has historically been seen as a risky speculative investment for those looking to profit in the short term gold meanwhile has always been considered a safehaven assetnow bitcoins rapid ascent to over  per coin backed by new investments from tesla and other institutional names has led some to question whether old assumptions about these assets are correctgiven digital currencies dizzying climb insider surveyed  experts to see if theyd rather hold bitcoin or gold for the next  years and why we asked bitcoin bulls gold lovers analysts executives and moreread more jpmorgan says buy these  stocks set to soar as bond yields make a surprising jump higherheres what they had to sayholding goldmy vote would be for gold because it has thousands of years of a historical record as a store of value has onefifth the volatility of bitcoin and doesnt face the same competition risk the day that queen elizabeth trades in the five pounds of gold in her crown for crypto is the day ill shift course  david rosenberg of rosenberg research former chief economist and strategist for merrill lynch canada and merrill lynch in new york gold and silver have been stores of value and mediums of exchange for at least  millennia in every civilization in every corner of the world it has unmatched accessibility to people of all economic standing and technological knowledge and gold is the ultimate currency of central banks silver of the people there is room for cryptocurrencies too since their digital nature is a fundamental difference from gold and silver but that characteristic also ensures that cryptocurrencies will never replace gold and silver and will ultimately improve the metals value  phil baker president and ceo hecla mining company gold has long been considered to be the safehaven asset of choice and while bitcoin is the new kid on the block its debatable that it will eat into golds market share for a number of reasons bitcoin and gold both have significant advantages over fiat currencies because neither can be diluted or debased there is a possibility that bitcoin could one day cease to exist through hostile legislation some bitcoin derivatives have already been banned companies such as facebook who have attempted to start crypto have been prevented from doing so so while bitcoin is a more recent form of investment that is certainly receiving a lot of hype gold has retained its value through centuries whether bitcoin will offer the same level of longevity is highly questionable  sylvia carrasco ceo and founder of the gold exchange platform goldex one of the assumptions underlying bitcoins bull case is its limited supply but the supply of cryptocurrencies on the whole is theoretically unlimited some extol bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier but it has so far exhibited higher correlations to equities than gold particularly during periods of equity market stress when diversification tends to add the most value the demand for bitcoin may be over its skis relative to its likelihood to carve out a significant economic or financial use case  michael reynolds investment strategy officer at glenmede both crypto and gold have passionate investor basesâ€¦ however there are very clear differences golds history as a basic building block of global money is  years old and timetested bitcoin is  years old and has existed in only one monetary regime the standard deviation of bitcoins price is  making it a horrible store of value recent price history shows a large bias toward speculative interest so much so that companies are tempted to include bitcoin on corporate balance sheets to help grow assets in excess of corporate performance crypto is a poor monetary substitute in the us filing your taxes requires a voluntary disclosure of your cryptocurrency profits if a crypto trade automatically generated a statement to the irs as a brokerage transaction does the speculative outlook could dim robert minter director of investment strategy aberdeen standard investmentsbitcoin bullsbitcoin is a  improvement over gold as a store of value the world is realizing this and beginning to reprice digital currency in realtime although bitcoin has increased hundreds of percent in the last few months it is likely to continue appreciating in us dollar terms over the coming years i suspect that bitcoins market cap will surpass golds market cap by  for this reason i own no gold and have a material percent of my net worth invested in bitcoin  anthony pompliano of pomp investments and morgan creek digital assets the crypto bull run has seized the attention of millions of people who previously had never considered digital currencies like bitcoin to be an alternative asset while gold and bitcoin are both sometimes used as a means to diversify and hold a range of valuable assets in many ways they are quite different bitcoin and other digital currencies can be easily traded on platforms we have seen progressive global firms offering to receive payment in bitcoin and advocates such as tesla taking an active role in promoting it this liquidity ease of exchange and wider use in the modern economy are some of the major differentiators gold has a relatively defensive purpose to hold value whereas bitcoin and other currencies are intended to have several uses not least ease of exchange purchase and liquidity  pavel matveev ceo wirex based on the trajectory of this digital gold path and use cases globally we believe bitcoin will be a mainstream asset class in the future while gold has clear value and safety the upside in bitcoin is eyepopping if it stays on its current course over the next decade  daniel ives managing director and senior equity research analyst at wedbush securities gold is no pun intended the standard if you want to measure purchasing power over millennia the liquidity of gold has been consistent over time gold is what defines the xaxis of purchasing power over time bitcoin while it shares defensive qualities with gold has the additional attribute of being aspirational what bitcoin would seem to possess is the potential to go up to multiples of a moonshot no one thinks gold will moonshot bitcoin is also finite unlike gold no increase in demand can change that there is zero elasticity  jp thierot ceo of uphold a digital money platform i would probably pick bitcoin but why not both gold and bitcoin have a very similar aspect to the portfolio i would add gold as a diversifier i would add bitcoin as a diversifier the hedge is diversification bitcoin is a tool to get there bitcoin is a hedge to losing money to something stable  mike venuto coportfolio manager of the amplify
