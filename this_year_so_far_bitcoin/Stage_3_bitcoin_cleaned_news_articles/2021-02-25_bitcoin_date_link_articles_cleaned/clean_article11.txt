what’s clear however is that there’s no need for the fed to create its own proofofwork system for fedcoin proof of work is an expensive way to establish trust in a decentralized world the fed which is a centralized and already trusted entity doesn’t need to spend massive amounts of electricity reestablishing trust every time someone wants to spend a digital dollar instead it could just clear the transaction like any bank does cheaply and easily as long as people trust the fed not to steal their money and why would it when it can print as much as it likes a fed payments system could be incredibly cheap without relying on any cryptocurrency technology at all
