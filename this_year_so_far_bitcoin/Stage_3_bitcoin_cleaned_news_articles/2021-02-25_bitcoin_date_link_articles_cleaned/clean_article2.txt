what happens if bitcoin succeedsjon danielssonas the price of bitcoin continues to rise this column argues that most of us would not want to live in a society where bitcoin succeeds fortunately the internal contradictions and perverse consequences of cryptocurrencies success mean that they are destined for failure until then it might make sense for speculators to ride the cryptocurrency bubble so long as they get out in timeeditors note this column supersedes a blog by the author published on voxeu in in a week when bitcoin is setting records with a market value exceeding a trillion dollars what would it mean if cryptocurrencies succeedthe only reason all the bitcoins are worth a trillion dollars is the expectation of success as they are not very useful today cryptocurrencies must provide some valuable service if they are to justify their high valuation otherwise holding bitcoin is just like collecting stamps or beanie babies – a minority activity that does not justify the current  pricebut what is the valuable service that makes bitcoin successfulto the vast majority of bitcoin investors success means its price continues to rise but if that is all there is to it someday a little boy will yell the emperor has no clothes and the price will come crashing downthe bitcoin enthusiasts are quite vague on what success means beyond rising prices they seem more fond of arguments wrapped in mysticism than basic economic logic the most important criterion for success is that cryptocurrencies end up being used in commercial transactions like tesla accepting bitcoin today all the other value propositions like their use in payment systems fatás and weder di mauro  or their safehaven role cheema et al  flow from that if cryptocurrencies cannot be directly exchanged for real goods they will not be very successfulin other words the value proposition for bitcoin is that it will displace fiat money – the dollar euro renminbi and all the others – either fully or partially as i argue below i think it is inevitable that it will be ‘either or’ – either full displacement or no displacement complete success or failure and as i said here on vox three years ago danielsson  i dont think cryptocurrencies make senseso how do bitcoins compare to fiatthe us dollar is a debt obligation of the us government the value of the us dollar for the holder of that dollar is the real goods the dollar buysin spite of bitcoin containing the word “coin” and cryptocurrencies the word currency they are not money in any conventional sense just try to explain bitcoin to a typical person and it becomes immediately clear that cryptocurrencies are not money in the way most people as well as professional economists think about moneythe task of comparing bitcoin with money is further made complicated by the fact that there is no single definition of money should bitcoin be compared to central bank paper money and reserves  or ondemand money  or something else and then will bitcoin have the same velocity as the money we use todayby a first approximation suppose we use ondemand money  for the fiatbitcoin comparison and further assume they will have the same velocity the amount of  money in the  countries is  trillion which means of course that that  money can buy  trillion worth of goods if the price of bitcoin goes to  the holders of bitcoin can buy  trillion worth of goodsif bitcoin ends up equalling the purchasing power of  money the price of a single bitcoin will be  million these are very rough approximations but a full displacement of fiat money would mean the price of a bitcoin would be somewhere in the neighbourhood of a million and a half dollars whether it is a million or two million is immaterial for the discussion below but i think success means the price of bitcoin will be quite a bit higher than thatthat leaves us with two interesting questions what happens to the holders of bitcoin and what happens to everybody elseto begin with the current owners of bitcoin will become the wealthiest people in the world rivalling the kings and emperors that ruled over empires in centuries past they literally will own all the money they can buy anything they want there arent that many of them compared to the multitudes that own assets today via all the pension funds and mutual funds and the rest it is a tiny group of peopleso a sharp increase in inequality is an inevitable consequence of bitcoin success and unlike the richest people of today – the jeff bezoses and elon musks whose wealth comes from creating companies that benefit most of us – the bitcoin aristocrats will get their rank just by buying early they will make no contribution to societywhen the bitcoin aristocrats start spending their trillions what does that mean for the rest of uswe do know that such extreme levels of inequality fuel social division and populism the bitcoin aristocrats will come under increasing threat and the government will have to respond it will protect or attack it cant be neutral either way political and social instabilities get worseif then the bitcoin investors respond that everybody should buy bitcoin all that accomplishes is to bid the price up even more making existing bitcoin investors even more wealthywhat about the rest of us who dont own bitcoinas bitcoin starts displacing fiat money more and more it will change society in profound ways some will benefit those who own assets and services they can sell to the bitcoin aristocrats will prosper someone has to build their houses and clean their toilets educate their children and cook their food someone has to defend them from the rest of societybut that is also a small minoritythose whose material wellbeing depends on fiat will suffer the worst like pensioners because as bitcoin continues to gain in dominance the less we want to hold fiat we will all want to be paid in bitcoin and hold our savings in bitcoin as in any market the amount of goods and services that can be acquired by fiat money will inevitably fall further hurting those whose lives depend on the bitcoin enthusiasts will of course respond by saying they should also buy bitcoinbut the perverse consequence of this is that as bitcoin continues its ascendance the less fiat will be worththis is why i think coexistence between bitcoin and fiat would be an unstable equilibrium if bitcoin becomes successful then we will want to use it more and more that makes it even more successful so that we disregard fiat even more in the end fiat will be fully displaced as the success of bitcoin becomes a selffulfilling prophecy aizenman  auer and claessens there is however a contradiction in this scenario if bitcoin becomes the money we use in our daily lives it must also become a unit of account the current volatility of bitcoin precludes it from becoming such a unit of account because which shopkeeper wants to change their prices every time bitcoin goes up or down in value and who wants high volatility in the purchasing power of their salary or savingsand that contradiction may be the reason why bitcoin cannot become successful success means it is used in transactions but that requires bitcoin becoming a unit of account and for that to happen the purchasing power of a bitcoin must stabilisefortunately the more successful bitcoin becomes the more visible the perverse consequences and the internal contradictions become so that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be discarded long before we get to that point at which time the price of bitcoin will head to zerobitcoin is a bubble it makes sense to ride the bubble as long as possible – just get out in time watch out for a little boy yelling “the emperor has no clothes”referencesaizenman j  “on the
