everyone knows bill gates and warren buffett are good friends this could be the reason why berkshire hathaway never bought shares of microsoft they have many similarities and they both are bearish on bitcoin well i understand buffett’s reasoning as he has never been into technology but the founder of the world’s leading pc operating system os is also bearishthis whole bitcoin frenzy is a little difficult to digest btc is a digital coin that has no physical form no regulation is prone to scams and changes the power play from banks to those who have the digital coin while the concept is revolutionary it has both supporters and criticswhat does bill gates have to say about bitcoinbtc gained immense popularity when tesla invested  billion in the digital coin the world’s onandoff richest man elon musk clearly stated that it is not him who has invested in btc but tesla however people fail to differentiate the two just like when berkshire hathaway invested in snowflake’s initial public offering ipo media reports read the buffett had invested in cloud tech and earned some billions from its purchasein february when tesla disclosed its btc exposure bill gates cautioned the public to avoid elon musk’s crypto path in an interview with bloomberg television gates said “elon has tons of money and he’s very sophisticated so i don’t worry that his bitcoin will sort of randomly go up or down” he added “i do think people get bought into these manias who may not have as much money to spare my general thought would be that if you have less money than elon you should probably watch out”you may argue that microsoft accepts btc as payment but its founder is against the digital currency here again i will point out that gates and microsoft are different microsoft’s decisions need backing from the board and not just gates alonewhat makes bill gates anticrypto is the anonymity of crypto transactions that are irreversible and lack regulatory compliance moreover mining crypto is bad for the environment given the amount of electricity it consumes however he promotes digital money which is more regulatory compliant cost effective and energy efficient than cryptocurrency transactionsshould you invest in hive blockchain right now click here to learn morewhat does warren buffett have to say about bitcoinwarren buffett called bitcoin a “gambling device” and associated it with frauds but buffett has never been a supporter of gold either if you see his comments on gold and btc they are similar as btc is digital goldfor bitcoin he said “it doesn’t do anything it just sits there it’s like a seashell or something and that is not an investment to me” for gold he said “it gets dug out of the ground in africa or someplace then we melt it down dig another hole bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it it has no utility”buffett likes business something that has utility and you can predict the growth with revenue earnings and future demand even steel and oil are commodities but with utility which makes their demand predictable but that is not the case with gold or bitcoin hence they are called alternative investmentsthe way you look at alternative investments is with a long term horizon where your money is secure and probably gives you a regular income for instance you could buy an apartment for  and earn a rent of investing in btcalthough buffett despises gold as an investment berkshire bought barrick gold stock to enjoy the dividends it gives but that is not the case with bitcoin mining firms they don’t pay dividends if you are a riskaverse investor stay away from btcif you want to diversify into an alternative investment consider buying stocks of hive blockchain technologies tsxvhive this is the oldest crypto mining stock trading on the toronto stock exchange hive mines bitcoin ethereum and other currencies which diversifies your exposure to different cryptoshive’s main cost is the highperformance computing hardware electricity and cooling used to operate the mining data centres its revenue comes from selling btc and the fee for processing transactions despite having revenue and earnings it is difficult to forecast hive’s growth as it largely depends on crypto prices
