could this be the year that cryptocurrencies become mainstream it certainly looks that way as a number of cryptos take off in value reaching record highs across the boardin april bitcoin exceeded  € while this month ethereum broke through the  € threshold even dogecoin  the meme altcoin launched to poke fun at the former two mentioned  has made advancesbut it’s also hard to keep up with the sheer volume of cryptocurrencies being launched with more than  estimated to be in circulation at the time of publicationdespite their progress the likes of bitcoin and its ilk continue to be seen as risky investments due to their volatility though perceptions are changing their recent success has also brought increased scrutiny particularly over energyhungry practices such as miningbut there is one cryptocurrency that is starting to make waves for more positive reasons  chiahaving officially begun trading last week chia is trying to do things differently for one thing it is being branded as the green cryptocurrency but what makes it ecofriendly and how does it differ from other cryptoshow is chia different from bitcoinas the original  and to date highest valued  cryptocurrency bitcoin has set the standard for the altcoins that have followed in its wakein this respect many cryptos use a practice first adopted by bitcoin to create new tokens called mining known as a proof of work system mining requires the use of computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to unlock new bitcoin tokensthis is the first major difference with chia the latter using what is called a proof of space and time system instead what does that entail to farm chia you need a large number of empty hard discs to house plots which are then awarded a number of blocks based on available spacechia’s creator bram cohen the man who founded the filesharing platform bittorrent believes this method is more reliable secure and greener than how cryptos like bitcoin operateit’s this claim about it being more environmentally friendly that is particularly attracting attentionchia is potentially leading to a ewaste disaster getty images via canvahow green are chia’s credentialsthe process of mining requires both rigs  made up of specialist computer processors  and access to large amounts of energybitcoin’s surge in popularity has meant that home miners have been unable to match the output of largescale mining operations particularly when it comes to prohibitive energy billsas well as pricing out smallscale traders the colossal consumption of energy required by mining is having an indelible impact on the planetbitcoin investors are keen to point out that the crypto is increasingly relying on more renewable sources of energy but due to the cost of electricity involved the concentration of mines often moves around the global chasing lower energy pricesmore often than not cheaper sources of electricity are more likely than not generated by coalfired power plants rather than wind turbinesin china where the majority of the world’s bitcoin mines are located the process will create as many carbon emissions in a year as italy or saudi arabia by  as well as reports last month of localised power outagesgiven it doesn’t use mining chia has been praised for potentially opening up a new costeffective avenue for home users as well as providing a more environmentally sound alternative to energyintensive bitcoinon the face of it at least chia is living up to its green credentials in that it doesn’t need to use up high volumes of electricity however the means by which chia farmers mint new tokens is not without its critics  or an environmental costwhy is chia being criticisedeven before its launch on trading platforms at the start of may chia had already courted controversy after its early success caused a run on hard drivesthe surge in demand has already caused a shortage and pushed prices skyhigh in china and other parts of asia since the launch of chia was first announced in february prices for  drives have soared by  per cent in china alone according to the south china morning postthe reason for the increased demand is not just the sudden popularity of a newlylaunched cryptocurrency although this explains it in large part it is also fuelled by the fact that chia farming is incredibly wasteful when it comes to the required hardwareaccording to recent reports from china continuous chia farming is resulting in the shelf life of a  hard drive for example being reduced to just  days rather than a usual lifespan of around a decadethe result is the voiding of all warranty on the hard drives used and the potential for vast mountains of discarded unusable electronics ewaste is an evergrowing hazard as consumers are quicker to consign their electronic devices to landfills in order to upgrade to newer modelsewaste tends to contain toxic components such as heavy metals like lead and lithium which if disposed of improperly risk contaminating the environment and posing a human health riskfor the time being low energy costs are incentive enough to keep chia’s star in the ascent but the true environmental impact this green crypto will have is still uncertain
