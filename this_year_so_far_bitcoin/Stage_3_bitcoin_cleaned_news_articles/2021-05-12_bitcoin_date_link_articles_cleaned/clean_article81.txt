the cryptocurrency market is known for its fierce volatility which makes it unattractive to less aggressive investors investors often wonder about the best approach to cryptocurrency investments hence the reason for this articledollarcost averaging dca is an investing strategy where an investor invests a total sum of money in small increments over a period of time as opposed to investing all at once dca is designed to help offset any negative effect on an investment caused by shortterm market volatility for instance if the price of an asset drops during the time you are dollarcost averaging then you stand to make a profit if the price moves back updca is the best approach for individuals who are not professional investors it can save an investor a lot of effort trying to time the market in order to get the best prices it is a tool for investing slowly and consistently and it aims to protect against the human tendency of wanting to gain all at oncereadhow dollarcost averaging worksapplying dollarcost averaging is very simple and you do not necessarily have to invest in dollars the approach works well with any other currency you first have to determine the total amount of money and the cryptocurrencies you wish to invest in then instead of investing the money all at once you invest it in small equal installments over a specific length of timecommitting to this approach means at times you’ll be investing when the market or a particular asset has dropped in value it also means there will be times when you’re buying during a market selloff some riskaverse investors might not be encouraged to purchase securities during bear markets but viewed from another perspective buying from bear markets allows you to invest in potentially profitable cryptocurrency assets at significantly cheaper rates especially when they are below their intrinsic valueby buying when others might sell dollarcost averaging can potentially help you to reap the benefits of buying low and selling highreadpractical examplesay i plan to invest a total sum of  into the cryptocurrency called eos whose previous peak price was around  and i decide to invest this amount of money equally over the next  days ie  per day between the  of may and the  of may  dca seeks to reduce the risk of incurring a substantial loss resulting from investing the entire lump sum just before a fall in the marketas seen from the chart if i invested the total amount of money at once at the previous peak of  although i would be in profit today of about  if i did not dollar cost average using the current market price of eos at  i could have gotten in at an aggregated cost when the market dipped from the previous peak to around another observation is that the best time to apply this method is during a bear market where prices have dropped to a lowprice zone as seen in the chart a potential profit of  could have been made with an average cost of  this price was gotten by taking the average cost of the high and low prices between the  and the  of may  and taking the overall average of these days with the current market price at readwith every golden strategy there are downsidesthe most notable downside of dca is the possibility that you might miss out on a large gain you could have earned if you had invested all your money at once when the market was downfrom the example if an individual started dollar cost averaging on the  of may  on eos a potential gain of  would have been missed out on that being said we must remember that big profits require timing the market correctly which not all professional investors can do dca is still a potentially safer way to take advantage of big market dipsanother downside will be increased transaction charges because of the transaction charges of many trading platforms you’re going to incur more trading costs with a dollarcost averaging strategyanother risk is that you may buy after a steep rise in asset prices and face a downward correction afterwardsa dca strategy over time usually includes buying assets at any stage whether it be stable depreciating or appreciating if done consistently a dca strategy tends to lower your risk and does better over a longterm horizon
