while those comfortable in the dollar bubble deride bitcoin the stories of three emerging market users demonstrate why it is so importantin the eyes of most western elites investors journalists and academics bitcoin rates anywhere from an annoyance to a disasterjust a few days ago american billionaire charlie munger described bitcoin as “disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization” warren buffett once the world’s richest person sat next to munger in obvious agreement he has said bitcoin is “a delusion” and “rat poison squared” and has warned that he is sorry about its rise “because people get their hopes up that something like that is gonna change their lives” bill gates who also used to be the world’s richest person has said bitcoin is a “greater fool theory” investment and that he would short it if he couldhbo host bill maher skewered bitcoin in an extended segment on his show saying that the new currency’s promoters are “moneyhungry opportunists” a few weeks earlier the new york times ran a story that said bitcoin will “ruin the planet” financial times columnist martin wolf has long pegged it as “ideal for criminals terrorists and money launderers”prominent ivy league economist jeffrey sachs has said that bitcoin offers “nothing of social value” while former international monetary fund imf chief and european central bank president christine lagarde has called it a tool for “totally reprehensible money laundering activity”over the past decade these financial experts reporters and policymakers have continuously pounded the narrative that bitcoin is risky dangerous bad for humans and bad for the planetthey are wrong and they are blinded mainly by their financial privilegehow financial privilege blinds dollar users to bitcoin’s importancethe critics cited above are all wealthy citizens of advanced economies where they benefit from liberal democracy property rights free speech a functioning legal system and relatively stable reserve currencies like the dollar or poundin reality only  of our planet’s population is born into the dollar euro japanese yen british pound australian dollar canadian dollar or swiss franc the other  are born into autocracy or considerably less trustworthy currencies  billion people live under authoritarianism and  billion people live under double or tripledigit inflationcritics in the dollar bubble miss the bigger global picture that anyone with access to the internet can now participate in bitcoin a new money system with equal rules for all participants running on a network that does not censor or discriminate used by individuals who do not need to show a passport or an id and held by citizens in a way that is hard to confiscate and impossible to debasewhile western headlines focus on coinbase going public tesla buying billions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin and tech bros getting fabulously rich there is a quiet revolution happening worldwide until now governments and corporations have controlled the rules of money that is changingto learn more the author spoke to bitcoin users in sudan nigeria and ethiopia three countries with a combined population of  million well in excess of the number of individuals living in the united statesthe three speak for millions whose lived experience is much closer to that of the average person on this planet gates munger and buffett may not have recently dealt with conflict and violence black markets relentless inflation political repression and rampant corruption in their daily routine but most doand yet these bitcoiners are more hopeful for the future than the doomers listed above for them bitcoin is a protest a lifeline and a way outhere are their storiesbitcoin in nigeriaire aderinokun is a nigerian entrepreneur she is a frontend developer and user interface designer from lagos and is the cofounder coo and vice president of engineering at buycoins a cryptocurrency exchange that went through y combinator in  and is now one of the most popular places to buy bitcoin in west africa she is a prolific writer speaker organizer and activist and one of the founding members of the feminist coalition a group that champions equality for women in nigerian societyaderinokun talked about nigeria as a melting pot like the us of africa three big ethnic groups dominate the country but the population is split into hundreds of different tribes this is a strength but also a challenge as it is hard to bring so many different people together the country is governed through a predominantly muslim north and a predominantly christian south and the national leadership rotates between these constituencies nigeria has the largest economy in africa and the largest population with more than  million citizens but much of the wealth is tied to the export of oillike in many rentier states there is massive corruption and inequality while the fabulously rich jetset around the world six nigerians are impoverished every minute people who have wealth and power aderinokun said do not let it trickle down this has resulted in a situation where in major urban areas such as abuja and lagos there are countless lawyers for instance working in restaurants toiling away in careers that are professionally beneath them because there are not enough opportunities millions head to the big cities for jobs only to come up empty handedas a result aderinokun said the country struggles with unemployment especially among the youth  of the population is under  years old out of this crisis however are upsides she credits nigerians with being incredibly entrepreneurial people do what they need to do to get by and having a side hustle she said is naturalpart of this need to hustle relates to the country’s economic situation where the official inflation rate now stands around  with food inflation even higher in her personal experience aderinokun has seen the naira decline from  per dollar to  per dollar people she said are quite aware that the elites are stealing from the citizens through debasement it is expected so much so that when one’s family or friend gets a government job she said there is an assumption that they will provide for you and a circle of others the money trickles down through nepotism and the people at the top get fat this is an example of the cantillon effect in action where those closest to the point of money creation benefit at the expense of the restgrowing up she saw people try to keep their money in dollars or send it abroad or buy real estate this was how nigerians could protect the fruits of their time and energy but only a handful had these options now bitcoin is changing the game allowing more people to save like never before anyone with internet access now has an escape from their unreliable and exploitative national monetary systemaderinokun got her start in bitcoin with a coinbase account in  she and her friends initially thought could we use this new technology to send money abroad as it turned out bitcoin was easier and faster for sending money from nigeria to the us than traditional means so she decided to launch buycoins paystack — the nigerian tech giant — was just a few years old then and she is grateful that it existed at the time as it allowed buycoins to reach customers and create an experience that otherwise would have been impossibleat first the payment component of bitcoin was what really attracted aderinokun the idea that it could be easy instead of hard to send money from one place to another skipping over national borders this she thought is something bitcoin can fixbeyond the exchange itself buycoins also released an app called sendcash at first it helped people outside of nigeria send money home perhaps a family member moved to the us and they want to send dollars back the recipient would normally need a domiciliary account in dollars but aderinokun said those are difficult to open even then going from dollars to naira can be hard they thought could bitcoin help streamline the processwith sendcash users in the us send bitcoin to the app and it deposits as naira a few minutes later in any nigerian bank account today the app also sends naira to the us or ghana all using bitcoin as a payment railaderinokun said that around  of the nigerian population has internet access so is her mission worth it if a majority of nigerians still cannot even access bitcoin she said this is a dilemma she often ponders there are countless idps internallydisplaced persons across nigeria who cannot accept cryptocurrency because they do not have a smartphone in the end she said the work and mission is worth it because even though there are many who do not have a feature phone or smartphone there are millions who do and those individuals are sharing access to smart apps with those who do not have themas for the gates and buffets of the world aderinokun said some of bitcoin’s critics may have valid points to debate around for example the environmental impact — but she takes issue with western elites saying there is no upside or that it is a ponzi scheme or that it is just for funthey do not understand she said how important bitcoin is for those who cannot get dollars for billions they are trapped in a flawed currency that does not fulfill the purpose of what currency is supposed to do for many in nigeria and beyond bitcoin is providing another option and solving real problemsis it just helping the rich aderinokun laughed and said this is not the case at all it is providing employment it is helping people convert their naira to other currencies it is enabling commerce where it was not previously possible with the feminist coalition it helped people overcome financial repression and the freezing of activist bank accounts this is not she said just a case of people sitting around watching the pricemoving forward aderinokun thinks more education is essential nigerians are still very misinformed about bitcoin the main reason they know about it she said is because the price keeps going up and many do not see past that scams are a huge obstacle finally though she said people are beginning to understand they know bitcoin is volatile but they see that it goes up and to the right over time instead of down and to the right like the nairashe also wants to focus on building bridges and ramps between the naira and cryptocurrencies buycoins works with a naira stablecoin the ngnt which she said can also be helpful to people without traditional bank accountsand building on and offramps matters because the nigerian government has buycoins and other exchanges in its crosshairs recently the regime pronounced bitcoin as not legal tender and said banks should not hold or treat it as such they later clarified that individuals could still trade but have pressured regulated financial institutions to stay away buycoins has been struggling to hold naira because banks do not want to work with it but now aderinokun said it has shifted to a peertopeer solution when users need to go in and out of naira depositors and withdrawals are matched in a marketplaceaderinokun does not actually think it is possible to effectively ban bitcoin the most the government can do perhaps is what it has already done — forcing institutions to stay away but it cannot stop individuals from using hardware wallets or conducting peertopeer activity in a place like nigeria no one she said can stop me it is like saying it could ban facebook she said it could shut down the internet but that would have disastrous consequences for the whole nationwhat the government should be doing instead she said is trying to understand bitcoin and working with exchanges to allow nigerians to connect to the world around them aderinokun does not think the government should have an adversarial attitude in fact she believes bitcoin can help it maybe it would even be a good thing if the nigerian government figured out bitcoin before other nations but she said for the moment it is not even close to understanding how bitcoin works when asked if it is using blockchain surveillance or spying on individual transactions she laughed it does not have the abilities or knowhow yet she saidas for the future aderinokun is hopeful because she has seen bitcoin’s potential she watched it shine in the context of human rights and activism last october in the middle of nationwide protests against sars a notorious special police unit that was terrorizing citizens across the country the feminist coalition began accepting donations via flutterwave a fintech product this started off well enough but then the regime started cracking down its bank accounts were shutteredbitcoin was the only option left there was no other way to receive store and spend money for aderinokun and her cofounders this was an eyeopening moment they ended up setting up a btcpay server to process gifts from around the world in a way that avoided address reuse and protected donor privacy celebrities including jack dorsey shared the link and they raised more than  btcit was a great learning experience she said as many young people learned about bitcoin in this moment as a tool for activism the experience renewed and strengthened her belief in products she is building at buycoins people saw that bitcoin was cool and that the government could not stop it because of this aderinokun thinks that one day bitcoin will be talked about in the same way with the same importance as radio the tv and the internetasked if she is worried about a world where the government can no longer control the money she said no she is hopeful just printing more money she said has its downsides taking that option away is not necessarily a bad thingbitcoin in sudanmo also known as sudan hodl is a sudanese doctor he currently lives abroad in europe practicing medicine to support his family back homemo sees his country with brutally clear eyes he described the capital of khartoum as a crowded diverse megacity filled with pockets of extravagant wealth surrounded by an enormous belt of poverty it is a city of contradictions he said where palatial residences sit next to utter destitutionmo has worked in darfur where he described the lack of development as simply stunning there is no educational or health infrastructure during his time there he was one of three or four doctors treating hundreds of thousands of people there was a total lack of primary care and there were no pediatric hospitals he was treating women who suffered from fistula the national ruling class he said did not invest in these places warlords ultimately filled the power vacuum with the youth choosing violence instead of school as a way to get aheadmo told a tortured history of his country sudan he said has been living through a vicious cycle of military coups and authoritarian rule ever since gaining its independence from the british empire and losing its fragile first democracyislam mo said did not come to sudan by violence but through traders and sufis he said his muslim ancestors historically had a peaceful interpretation of their religion but in the  the rise of saudi arabia’s oil wealth led to the export of the extremist and militant ideology of wahhabism to many places around the world including sudan wahhabism was foreign to sudan’s culture but was forced into the country’s political structureby  military governments had allied themselves with the muslim brotherhood and imposed sharia law alienating the predominantly christian and animist south a democratic revolution in  was shortlived as islamists led by omar albashir staged another coup in  paving the way for three decades of his rule society was militarized and the intelligentsia were purged now if one spoke out against the regime mo said they were not just speaking out against them they were speaking against islam they were against god himself this gave bashir an excuse for his brutality and new jihads against ethnic minoritiessince colonial times minorities in south sudan and darfur had resisted authority from strongmen in faraway khartoum the seeds of this tension were planted in the  when these populations fell under postcolonial arab rule over time these minority groups rebelled only to be violently subjugated the bloodshed peaked in darfur in the early  when bashir committed genocide using the janjaweed militias to murder hundreds of thousands and displace millions of people this triggered the us and eu to increase sanctions against sudan cutting it off more deeply from the outside worldmo thinks it is important to share sudan’s economic history often overshadowed by the political story in addition to the extreme inequality on display in khartoum there is a bigger picture of lowincome workers trying to catch up to high inflation while those closer to the regime managed to do well infrastructure decayed and the average person suffered while bashir and his cronies loaded up on weapons real estate and foreign assets modern sudan is another vivid and tragic example of the cantillon effectit was not always like this mo said that under the gold standard three sudanese pounds once bought a dollar there was a middle class and khartoum was known as the london of north africa but in  the sudanese central bank took over and devalued the currency the first instance of what would happen many times over the coming decadeswhen bashir seized power in  he installed a regime of economic terrorism to instill fear in the population he chose to make an example of a young man named majdi mahjoub who was a single child living at home looking after his elderly parents a christian minority in a community of traders majdi had possession of a few thousand us dollars in his home the result of many years of family commercebashir created a new special “economic” division a sort of secret police that would go home to home searching for foreign currency or gold when the jackbooted thugs came to majdi’s house they found his savings and arrested him after a show trial he was hanged sending a message to the population if anyone tries to use anything but the sudanese currency through our banking system — if anyone tries to own their own money — they will get the death sentence even today according to mo many sudanese are fearful of using dollars or storing money at homeat the same time bashir launched a tribute system to finance his activities on top of what was taken through traditional taxation and seigniorage citizens had to pay a portion of their income to help the martyrs of their dictator’s wars the secret monetary police would spy on individuals freeze bank accounts confiscate assets and impose madeup fees on merchants no reasonable suspicion was required mo calls it a system of national extortionas far as the currency itself mo recalled several times in his life when the system was overhauled in the late  his family was living abroad in saudi arabia and when they visited home a quarter of a sudanese pound could buy a sandwich or a tasty snack on the street but after  when bashir changed the haram and colonial pound for the islamic dinar those quarter pounds became worthless the  saw massive inflation with the “official rate” of the dinar going from around  per dollar to more than  many years later in  bashir decided to ditch the islamic facade and switch back to the pound citizens had a small window to redeem dinars for the new currency after which they were no longer legal tender forcing citizens to surrender their savings or watch it disappeartoday after a series of devaluations and constant inflation a sudanese pound will officially obtain around  dollars according to mo inflation is  while the average citizen watched as their wages stagnated and living costs rose bashir and his cronies accumulated billions and saved them in foreign currencies locked away in swiss bank accounts today the new sudanese government is struggling to regain all that was looted and lost in the past  yearsin the spring of  in a stunning example of people power the sudanese population finally pushed out bashir since then a fragile reform government has been in place where military leaders of the old regime share power with a technocratic civilian government people were initially optimistic about the change mo said but the reality is not meeting their expectationshe says the imf has a deal to help give  per month to sudanese families and in a country where some only make a dollar a day this seemed significant the problem is the families are paid not in dollars but in pounds so the value disappears after a few months the sanctions levied on the bashir regime are now gone but most fintech products and payment apps are still not available for sudanese as corporations shy away due to “risk management”it is clear that in some places a political revolution is not enough toppling a tyrant like bashir is a historical and incredible achievement but people are still suffering so some like mo are turning to bitcoinin  mo first heard about this mysterious internet money as he put it on youtube he spent countless hours watching andreas antonopolous videos and read through “the internet of money” which helped him understand the “why” behind the new currency he started to use it while working abroad exchanging euros for bitcoin over paypal on localbitcoins he kept things small and mainly to himself but in  he started talking to family and friends he told them this is going to be a part of our future many of them are now saving in bitcoinas of today mo estimates that  million of sudan’s  million people have internet access and he thinks that in a few years that number will top  million there are more and more people coming online and there are now smartphones even in remote regions like darfur and the nuba mountains people are plugging in everywherehe said that the sudanese who do already have smartphones have an extended responsibility to help others with their privilege in his case he has a large extended family that he supports he is their uncle jimwhere there were once financial walls cutting off sudan from the world bitcoin has made bridges it is now easy for mo in europe to send money back to his friends and family what once took days now takes minutes and he does not have to trust any third parties or require his family to deal with thieves in governmentmo is beginning to see just how massive the lightning network will be for sudan because most users will be in the micropayment space sending transactions of  or  and will not be able to afford the increasingly high onchain fees if international exchanges can choose to service sudan and enable lightning withdrawals and deposits he said that would be an enormous step forward for financial empowermentas for the likes of bill gates and buffet mo said they might understand the technology behind bitcoin but they will never be happy about it because it is coming to seize a place on the global stage that they used to have just for themselves in direct contradiction to billionaire claims that bitcoin is worthless and has no social value mo knows many sudanese who rely on it as a lifeline maybe mo said the critics just cannot see past their financial privilegefor mo personally bitcoin has been transformative he has started a podcast in arabic for sudanese youth to talk about bitcoin money freedom and the future of their country fifteen years ago he could not have imagined being this optimisticone of the darkest moments in his life was in  after a peaceful political uprising was completely crushed mo left all social media he could not bear to look at the bloody images and videos streaming from the violence but now with twin political and economic transformations he sees the light at the end of the tunnel when people say bitcoin is hope he says that he agreesbitcoin in ethiopiakal kassa is an ethiopian businessman in a country of close to  million people more than  of the population has no access to a bank account this is a place he said where there are still communities that use salt for moneyin the remote northeast afar region dotted with volcanoes rifts and deserts the indigenous people mine salt as they have for generations and trek for days to barter it in markets for the goods they need it is their store of value medium of exchange and unit of account the word amole amharic for salt is even used today in ethiopia as the name of a mobile banking appaccording to kal  of ethiopians still live in rural areas outside of the capital of addis ababa home to  million very few have bank accounts or smartphones in total no more than  million ethiopians are connected to make matters worse ethiopia does not have open capital markets individuals cannot freely exchange their national currency — the birr — with dollars and vice versa sadly kassa said the country is still under the influence of militant marxism and economic centralizationtoday there is a bank rate that the national bank of ethiopia enforces at  birr per dollar and then a black market rate of  birr per dollar inflation is officially reported at around  kassa is not sure what the exact rate is but said that ethiopians traditionally buy a chicken or sheep or lamb for easter and these prices go up steadily every year when he arrived in ethiopia in  to start a consulting job one lamb went for around  birr today it can go for  or even  birrgovernment wages do grow kassa said but not on par with inflation he estimated salaries in urban areas have perhaps doubled over the past decade but goods have gone up by threetofive times since inflation is so high and such a constant phenomenon the upper classes use the dollar as their unit of account but outside of the cities people still account with and their living standards fall with the birr in rural areas people use cattle or sheep to store value if they can they obtain gold which is rare and still considered very precious dollars are officially illegalthe government is afraid that people will dump the birr for dollars pushing the price of the birr toward zero but the government operates a double standard wanting to retain as many dollars as it can for its own purposes if for example one runs a tourist service they are allowed to take payments into a dollar account which they can use to pay for imported goods for up to around two months but if they do not use those dollars within that window the government simply swaps the dollars out for birr at the official rate which of course means they get the fake price of  birr for one dollar and not the real market rate of kassa’s brother was arrested and imprisoned once simply because he had  in his pocket in ethiopia people are jailed for the crime of using better currencystarting in  ethiopia underwent a series of reforms under a young new leader who was awarded the nobel peace prize for efforts to end hostilities with neighboring eritrea the shifts appeared to open up political space and move the country toward liberalism after more than  years of a police state three years later however repression ethnic tensions and armed conflict have caused a democratic backslide this uncertainty has caused major capital flight on top of that ethiopia imports more than it exports oil medical goods and cars for example are all brought in from other countriesin this weak environment ethiopians are forced to buy government bonds which as kassa dryly noted have negative real interest rates they are as he put it donations for the statekassa was born in ethiopia but left as a young child growing up in california he moved back at the end of  as a senior associate for grant thornton working on privatization on the buy and sell sides he lived there until last summer when the government shut off the internetkassa’s phone could still send sms messages and make calls but there was no data the regime justified this as a defense against rebellions but especially during the pandemic lockdown this got old very quickly so last summer wearing just a backpack he got on a plane and headed back to the uskassa first heard about bitcoin in  when his roommate was mining it at chapman university but the idea did not click for him he spent years thinking bitcoin was just some kind of alternative and speculative investment he said his penny drop moment actually came when he was at the airport in addis last summer as he was boarding the plane he stood and wondered if i had my wealth stored in gold or cattle how could i take it across a bordertoday kassa has created telegram groups where he pays freelancers graphic designers and translators based in ethiopia with bitcoin in america he said most people treat bitcoin as an investment or as a savings account but he is using it as a medium of exchange and payment too it is easier and cheaper and now a part of his lifekassa is focused on the lightning network and uses it to pay his contacts in ethiopia he helps them set up the opensource free blue wallet and pays them directly with lightning he is amazed at how easy it is and how it transmits hard value instantly halfway across the worldon the other end his contacts use blue wallet as their savings accounts and they exchange locally into birr when they need to in peertopeer markets this is he said hugely preferable to western union and birrdenominated accounts where for example on a recent payment kassa had to pay  to send  when kassa pays his colleagues he pays them the full amount rather than paying through the government exchange rate where authorities steal a portion his contacts are their own banks and no one can debase or remotely confiscate their funds this kassa said is a revolutionkassa does have concerns and fears about bitcoin for example the ethiopian government is hyperconcerned about satellite internet if citizens are caught with satellite equipment for example they can go to prison in this context he is worried about the safety of people running their own bitcoin nodes he also thinks that many people may end up using custodial services since as of right now many cannot even tell the difference between bitcoin and other coins and are far away from understanding the difference between custodial and noncustodial services he is also cautious about all the new cheap smartphones flooding in from zte and huawei all from china he is worried about people using these phones for bitcoin hot wallets as he does not think they are safe in addition because the phone networks are not reliable people still carry cash in cities even if they have smartphones as sometimes the service goes outkassa said the biggest obstacle to bitcoin adoption in ethiopia might be the false promise of alternative cryptocurrencies in particular he has identified cardano as a threat in a recent video the currency’s creator spoke about working with the ethiopian regime to incorporate  million students onto the cardano blockchain and boasts that then they could be tracked with metadata throughout their life and career“our vision and goals” he said “are directly in line with the goals of the ethiopian government” in contrast kassa is glad that bitcoin’s goals are not in line with the aims of the thieves and bureaucrats who run his country he worried that many may fall prey to schemes like cardanoas for gates and buffet kassa actually did get a chance to go to the berkshire hathaway event in lincoln nebraska a few years ago it was very powerful he said to see  people coming together as part of a community but the event was very inwardlooking which explains how buffet and friends cannot see just how corrupt the world is around them they do not see the water that they swim in and are seemingly blind to the trillions of dollars of money laundered each year through the banking system for them to ignore the harms that the dollar system has caused on the developing world kassa said and instead focus on the flaws of bitcoin is naive and selfserving he is glad that these investors are dinosaurs they are not the futurein contrast  of the population of ethiopia is under the age of  once they start using bitcoin kassa thinks they will spread the technology quickly to friends and family adoption will not take decades but years when he moved back to ethiopia in  there were about  million people online now there are about  million in the next five years he expects a majority of the population will be connected and for bitcoin to followas far as priorities kassa thinks spreading education is most important he is currently working on translating “the little bitcoin book” into amharic as far as he knows there is no other bitcoin content translated as of yet into ethiopias three major languageswhen asked if he is worried about the government cracking down on bitcoin he said that it will be hard to get in the middle of a hardworking ethiopian and a better life the population is young agile creative and adapting it will not be stopped people he said are sick of poverty and earning money only to see it depreciatetoday ethiopians are at war with each other “we are fighting ourselves” kassa said “if we are willing to kill each other to solve our problems we will definitely be willing to try bitcoin as an alternative” and that he thinks will be a peaceful revolutionafter reading the stories of aderinokun mo and kassa and witnessing how bitcoin is so valuable to people outside of the dollar bubble compare this with what munger buffet lagarde sachs and others say about bitcoin that it is something with no social value that it will just get people’s hopes up only to let them down“disgusting”“rat poison”“i would short it”“totally reprehensible”for most people it is the government that lets people down it is the government that is reprehensible liberation technologies should be invested in not shortedand for those comfortable in the dollar bubble it’s time to check your financial privilege
