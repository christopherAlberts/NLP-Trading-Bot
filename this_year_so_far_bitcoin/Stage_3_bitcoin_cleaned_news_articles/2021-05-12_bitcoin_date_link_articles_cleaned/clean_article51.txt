if bitcoin doesn’t rally if and when stocks are under pressure due to inflationary worries it will likely set off an excruciating downtrend as king crypto’s mythos unravels and people come to terms with what it’s likely been about all along selling to the next guy a lot of people have infamously written “bitcoin is dead” articles not me i’ve written about why most people dont need bitcoin about why the evidence is overwhelming that bitcoin trades as a speculative asset but i’ve always left room for the possibility of the seemingly impossible that bitcoin will one day make a miraculous metamorphosis from a getrichquick trade to an inflationary hedge evidence such a day will come is paltry and the clock is ticking i’ve always maintained the most positive thing for bitcoin would be if it rallies during a stock selloff apart from a brief moment in october last year it’s never happened and right now is when it countsbitcoin’s been billed by its biggest proponents as a store of value in a hyperinflationary environment produced by excessive stimulus from policymakers right now investors’ biggest concern is inflation produced by excessive stimulus from policymakers and growth stocks are paying the price for it if an inflationdriven selloff gets more serious and bitcoin drops too its façade will erode quickly bitcoin has utility in its role as a censorshipresistant means of money transfer but many cryptos can accomplish this goal its the gold story thats been the secret to its success digital gold is the easiest catchphrase to remember repeat and fits with the financial narrative du jour of the moneyprinting generation but most importantly it’s been the most successful story because it’s been impossible to disprove – up until nowthis is the moment everyone’s been waiting for we just had the biggest bond selloff in history a few months ago and the dollar is in a monthlong freefall the prospect of inflation is causing unstoppable momentum stocks of the past decade to stall out bitcoiners have never been more convinced that destiny is manifest and many believe crypto canon calls for an extension of gains after last year’s block “halving” gold is finally rallying but bitcoin’s hit a wall if it sells off here the entire story falls apartimage sourced from pixabay
