despite bitcoin’s btc meteoric rise of over  this year onchain analysis paints a picture that it’s still early in the game why three words coin days destroyed cddby assessing cdd we can visualize the confidence amongst longterm bitcoin holders relative to the current price of bitcoin to understand how cdd works let’s start with coin dayswhat is a coin daycoin day is the number of days since a bitcoin was moved over from one wallet to another the logic behind coin days is to assign a higher value to an idle coin why simply because longterm holders of bitcoin have greater knowledge of market cycle volatility and are more adept at identifying the best times to buy or sell so when longterm holders sell their bitcoins the coin days destroyed will surge higher when strong hands do not spend it trends lower which suggests their confidence in a new bull marketwhat are coin days destroyedcoin days destroyed is when bitcoin has been sitting in a wallet  accruing coin days  and all of a sudden it is sold and becomes “destroyed” to be abundantly clear bitcoin is not actually destroyed its merely terminology that calculates the time erased here’s an example imagine if an investor purchases  bitcoin and holds it in his wallet for  days he then sees a big increase in the price and decides to sell he would have “destroyed”  bitcoin dayswhen investors are accumulating and few old coins are spent coin days destroyed will trend downwards during latestage bull markets old coins often are increasingly spent and will lead to a spike in coin days destroyedthe beauty of this formula it weighs less on the activity by shortterm traders these traders don’t hold bitcoin long therefore the impact on coin days destroyed will be minimal from the activities by shortterm tradershowever when longterm holders are starting to sell their bitcoins it’s worth paying attention to when we look at these important metrics it appears that bitcoin is nowhere near its high this year bitcoin is now over  but the  moving average for coin days destroyed is near its lowest levels see the chart belowthe decline in bitcoin days destroyed shows that old hands are stronger than ever amid the price increasehow is cdd calculatedcoin days destroyed is calculated bythe number of bitcoins in a transaction and then multiplying it by the number of days it has been since those coins were last spentthe “destroyed” part comes into effect when it is removed on receipt once again it means the coins held for long time periods will carry more weight in cdd this onchain metric shows the weight of the strong hands versus the shortterm speculators the current number of coin days destroyed is far lower than the  price top so this indicates that fewer veteran hands are selling than in the previous bull cyclesconsidering the bitcoin network is now  years old and the current btc supply has already appreciated it’s telling that strong hands are not selling their holdings this suggests that the market top is nowhere near our current price what’s more the higher demand from institutional investors could be the primary force behind this recent surge in longterm confidence from veteran holders in april fidelity investments with  trillion in assets under management introduced a crypto platform for its institutional clients called “sherlock” etf manager cathie wood announced she has joined the board of a european cryptocurrency platform called anum holdingsthese moves by highprofile asset management firms underscore the rise of institutional investors who are banking on the future growth in bitcointhe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc
