cryptocurrencies are having a major moment in the prices of the leading crypto assets such as bitcoin and ethereum have surged to new alltime highs numerous altcoins have blasted off into the stratosphere and cryptocurrency is taking popular culture by storm coinbases ticker coin trading application recently even took the top spot as the most downloaded application in the apple app store thats no doubt been helped by prominent figures such as elon musk spreading the cryptocurrency message far and wideone important player has not yet been swayed however the us securities and exchange commission remains a noteworthy holdout from cryptocurrency enthusiasm in the past the sec has repeatedly blocked efforts to launch a bitcoin exchangetraded fund other countries such as canada have now approved cryptocurrency etfs in their markets but the sec hasnt followed that exampleas of now the us only has cryptocurrency trusts such as the grayscale bitcoin trust gbtc while trusts like gbtc are arguably better than nothing they dont trade on major exchanges have poor liquidity and often sell at wide premiums or discounts to their underlying asset values a bitcoin etf might offer a much cleaner and more investorfriendly solutioncrypto etfs their time has comewith the new presidential administration theres also a new chairman at the sec gary gensler this led to hopes that the sec might immediately change course on cryptocurrency funds however it may be a more gradual process on may  the sec issued a public statement regarding bitcoin closedend funds mutual funds and etfsin this statement the sec continued to show caution about the cryptocurrency marketplace among other things investors should understand that bitcoin including gaining exposure through the bitcoin futures market is a highly speculative investment as such investors should consider the volatility of bitcoin and the bitcoin futures market as well as the lack of regulation and potential for fraud or manipulation in the underlying bitcoin market the statement readcryptocurrency proponents believe that the sec should already approve etfs matthew le merle is managing partner of blockchain coinvestors which operates funds of funds and invests directly in numerous blockchain companies le merle believes its time for cryptocurrency etfs its difficult for a regulator to approve an etf if the underlying asset is a new or not that well understood asset but that is nonetheless their job â€“ to make investable assets easily accessible to the broadest possible audience and etfs are one of the best solutions to that le merle sayswhat might explain the secs hesitancy so far the sec looks for a broad market with significant trading volume and pricing transparency before approving an etf crypto proponents push back on this argumentafter all the sec has approved etfs for a variety of esoteric instruments such as equity volatility dry bulk shipping and various metals and grainsle merle acknowledges that say two years ago the secs concerns about underlying market liquidity for bitcoin were valid the sec wants to make sure that theres no management or manipulation of prices on the underlying assets going into an etf while bitcoin used to be on a limited number of popular exchanges there is now enough liquidity and price discovery in bitcoin to make it functionally equivalent to something like gold or copper where there are approved etfswe feel like the lawmakers and regulators are supposed to open up access to democratize investing in appropriate ways and fundamentally etfs provide more access so theyre a good thing le merle sayswill crypto etfs stifle the industrysec regulation of the industry could in theory put a damper on the industrys innovation some things have been possible in cryptocurrency simply because its such an open environment however its not all bad news by any means to have the sec play a more active role with its new chairmangensler knows a lot about crypto and taught classes on the subject once you understand and see the potential its hard to be opposed to it regulations are good for the industry and hes knowledgeable and can make smart and sensible regulation says ben weiss ceo and cofounder of coinflip the largest crypto atm providerplus if the sec doesnt approve bitcoin etfs it could potentially prove quite harmful stifling innovation in a field with a ton of promise its not necessarily a desirable image for the worlds premier capitalist societyon a related note there has been some concern in the bitcoin community that etfs could make life more difficult for a lot of independent cryptocurrency exchanges and businesses theres a streak of antiwall street sentiment in much of the trading community so having crypto centralize at an institutional etf level could lead to backlashnot everyone is worried however the point of bitcoin is to hold your own coin but theres room for every sort of business and player in the industry and as much access as possible i think people should hold their own coin but for people that cant such as pension funds etfs wont monopolize the market weiss sayscrypto proponents arent worried about folks using etfs to bet against the market either a highquality market needs to have two sides as much as we may not like the people who focus on shorting the market does work better if there are two sides to every trade le merle says weiss brushed off concerns about short sellers as well rightly noting that shorting crypto has rarely been a profitable tradehow celebrities and memes affect the marketsome analysts have expressed concern about the rise of dogecoin safemoon and other such alternatives to the more established cryptocurrencies however it can easily be seen as part of the evolution of a rapidly developing ecosystem the free market determines which altcoins succeed the memecoins are about the retail investor its nice to see retail investors have a seat at the table collectively retail is serious money even if individuals dont have the same money as goldman sachs weiss says
