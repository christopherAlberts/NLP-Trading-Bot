bitcoiners and fiat expertssociety has conditioned us to listen to experts they teach us what to eat what to learn how to exercise how to raise our children and how to care for the environment we think they know better that they have our best interests at heart after all they have fancy titles decades of experience appear in mainstream media and have tons of followers many of them even work in organizations that have world in the name how prestigious is that we intuitively think we wouldnt be able to decide whats best for ourselves why would we or more importantly how could we go against advice from expertsmoney from first principlesto understand bitcoins value and i mean truly understand it you have to start asking what is money this sends precoiners spiraling down the bitcoin rabbit hole after extensive research on money and economics a veil is lifted from their eyes they start thinking if ive been lied to about money about inflation being normal what else have i been taught that was a lie this is generally where people become skeptical which leads them to think critically and not take things at face value for the first time they start paying attention to what experts are actually saying they begin seeing inconsistencies in between the various word salads some proceed to look at experts’ track records how could these experts be so dead wrong about so many things for so many years even worse nothing happens to them they arent fired there arent any consequences no accountabilitythats when some newcoiners begin their transformation its because of experts’ incompetence political agendas manipulation and corruption newcoiners become obsessed with relearning everything they begin studying history philosophy sociology diet and environment they are in pursuit of truth in a world where everything is manipulated and politicized they want realnessin order to do so you need to identify who the fiat experts are it is helpful to use the following framework first people have to realize experts arent allknowing and incapable of being irrational or outright wrong theyre as human as you and me as such they are prone to error then recognize that they have plenty of biases this is arguably the most important part absolutely everyone has biases the best you can do is be aware of them both your own and others’ and in doing so minimize their impact sadly it appears very few realize how impactful bias is in one’s decisionmaking it doesnt stop there experts also have political agendas after all selfinterest is a very powerful motivator experts like everyone else have bills to pay want promotions and also just dont want to get fired the problem there is misaligned incentives whats best for the expert or organization isnt always whats best for their audience oftentimes experts dont have these highlevel positions because theyre the best for the job but because they can be controlled on top of that humans have a hard time differentiating between confidence and intelligence be careful to not fall into this trap the bigger the influence the higher the accountability should be yet thats the exact opposite of what happens in our society the bigger a person’s influence the more untouchable they arefiat experts entering the bitcoin spaceexperts have a hard time grasping the fact that theyre just like everyone one else when it comes to bitcoin bitcoin doesn’t discriminate experts in my opinion do have one distinct advantage they can simply tweet i want to understand bitcoin and a flurry of bitcoin authors and podcasters will appear offering them their precious time that is extremely valuable experts are able to have oneonone conversations with the brightest minds in the space instead they come in thinking they have an original thought on why bitcoin doesnt work this repeats over and over again the same debunked criticisms different critics same bewildered reactions when bitcoiners begin their attack weve seen many examples of this already allen farrington has slayed a few himself a tale of two talebs and gauge theory does not fix this come to mind the former a twohour read deconstructing everything that is wrong about nassim taleb and the latter in allen’s own words “i spent  weeks learning a completely irrelevant subject at postgraduate level whose alleged expert thought nobody would ever actually do and hence he could bullshit about it undetected”lopp’s tweet sums up most critics of bitcoinbitcoin isn’t in any textbook the world has never seen something like it before phds try to mold bitcoin into their theories but bitcoin works despite themfiat experts fail to understand that bitcoins biggest critics are bitcoinersexperts should first dive deep down the rabbit hole before providing input their credentials just help them get their foot in the “influence door” after that if they dont shut up and learn they will get dismissedsaifedean’s thread articulates many bitcoiners’ frustrations with fiat expertshe also has a podcast episode about this topic with allen farringtoncyber hornetswhat drew me to bitcoin twitter was how different the community is in that they dont rely solely on past accomplishments to continue to have influence as soon as influencers start being inconsistent unethical or malicious they will get called out no matter who they are the cyber hornets will swarm what i found interesting was michael saylor understanding this and publicly acknowledging his loyalty to bitcoinevery expert should be held to a high standard of accountability in any industry like i said above the bigger the influence the higher the responsibilityreputation in a bitcoin worldsoon if not already reputation will be almost like a currency what you say and what you do will have great consequences be that good or bad a lot of people start with noble intentions but get corrupted along the way thats why there needs to be accountability at all times dont trust verify is built into bitcoin bullshitters wont survive for very long when humans get comfortable in their positions they become susceptible to corruption greed or manipulation thankfully if there is constant accountability they wont get too comfortable in a bitcoin future where people and organizations are allowed to fail only the best will rise upi wrote this for those that are early on their bitcoin journey and are trying to make sense of the world when in doubt approach from first principles and stay true to yourself there is so much noise out there bitcoin is our signalthis is a guest post by
