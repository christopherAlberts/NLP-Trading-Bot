middleclass family money wasn’t the most important aspect growing up we led a simple life played outdoors for entertainment the importance of sharing and good values was instilled in usmy father came as a factory worker in the late  he worked at daewoo and moved onto his own businesses dubai’s economy picked up he had a great mind and as an entrepreneur did the right things at the right time he was into different ventures and jumped into real estate in the early  that’s when our family really took offdid your lifestyle changeto an extent there was a fine line between luxuries and things that were not required we always had that balance in place never went overboard our family believes in building assets for the future so whatever he made went more into real estate than a lavish lifestyle looking at my father and his instincts as an entrepreneur … from being a kid i always knew i wanted to have my own businesswhen did you earn your first wagein college i did parttime jobs and promotional work at gitex –  for a week for a  or  year old that’s pretty good money i used to enjoy life but would try to invest iti don’t think there’ll be an asset  on the planet that will give a return like it will over the next decade or so ashish bhandari owner aquaplusat about  i used to buy number plates hold them for a while as an asset and then flip them in dubai especially the local community they take pride in their plates my father helped me financially he never stopped us doing something if we were confident about it that has made me and my older brother confident entrepreneurs … if we believe in what we’re doing “go for it even if you go wrong”what was your best deali bought a threedigit plate for  flipped it for half a million and made  it took two or three months it was my father’s money so i gave it back to him i ended up losing a lot on plates as well but my father said “that’s how you learn” i probably ended up evenhe would never stop us trying something so long as it made sensebecause i saw him grow from a humble background i learned there are times when you won’t make money times when you’ll lose these kind of things help you in tough timeswhat led you to aquapluswe got the opportunity to take over in  the product was very promising the problem was the backend i knew if we could spend money and time correcting the basics this could be something else late  we were  per cent there and started marketing we’ve seen  per cent to  per cent growth sincemr bhandari says he loves spending on cars holidays and collectible watches that appreciate in value photo chris whiteoak  the nationalit’s about logistics and customer service i love the industry and thought about doing something out of the box if you look inside the five gallon bottle we’ve written the affirmation “love and gratitude” in english and arabic on the sticker we believe in positive energywhat is your spending and savings outlooksave first then spend i like creating an asset and what i earn from that asset is what i spend so i would buy property and spend the rent from that i understand there are times that are going to be amazing and times that are going to be tough so you’ve got to build for the future that’s kind of the reason i stepped into aquaplus it’s an essential sector – play it right you will growwhere do you savenumber one is property to keep building that portfolio for the time being it’s under the family umbrella we put into a family pool i also invest in stocks more in the india and us markets the only regret i have is not getting into bitcoin  years ago i used to read a lot about it in the early  of late pretty much all my savings are going into that i don’t think there’ll be an asset on the planet that will give a return like it will over the next decade or sodo you have a philosophy towards moneyit’s not the only thing that can make you happy it gives you a better life you can give more to your children it’s very important but not the most important thing over other values such as time with family money’s why you work but it’s not the only thing you look towards in life there always needs to be a balancedid parenthood alter your outlooki had a highrisk appetite since i finished college but that mellowed once i had children you realise it is not just about you the idea of securing an asset and earning from that really came  i understood the importance of trying to be financially independentdo you have spending regretsthere are a few things i shouldn’t have bought made mistakes but i don’t regret because it’s given me something to learn from i could have been smarter with my money but i’m not going to kill myself over investing in or buying something i didn’t need i could have done away with a couple of cars early on and invested that money insteadwhat are you happiest spending oncars holidays and collectible watches that appreciate in value going to the india vs pakistan world cup match in manchester in  with my older brother was special apart from material items i love playing cricket and golf collecting cricket bats when i get the chance i’ll probably be looking at a rollsroyce or bentleyi could have done away with a couple of cars early on and invested that money insteadhas the pandemic influenced your businessinitially we were worried luckily we did unbelievably well because probably  per cent to  per cent of aquaplus’ portfolio is households when everyone was locked down water consumption was really high a lot of people started spending time at home and we made a lot of new customerswhat has been your key financial milestoneturning aquaplus into a profitable venture with the help of a solid team i learned you need to be patient do things right focus on
