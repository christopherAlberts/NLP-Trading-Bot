if you bought a single bitcoin for  in february  and sold it four years later you’d pocket around but if you lived in hawai‘i you probably didn’t buy bitcoin after february  that month the digital currency exchange coinbase ceased operations in hawai‘i blaming overregulation local residents were given  days to transfer or sell their digital currency and close their accountssince then digital currency exchanges have struggled to operate in hawai‘i but a pilot program started in  opened the door for their return the digital currency innovation lab a joint project of the hawai‘i division of financial institutions and the hawaii technology development corp is a novel approach to regulation it’s a “regulatory sandbox” with state regulators working closely with a select group of companies and gathering data to inform decisions about how to regulate the industry moving forwardthis is a story about how a single state worker helped pave the way for innovation in the face of legislative inaction – and about the potential future of digital currency and blockchain technology in the islandscoinbase leave just before the surgejuan suarez a member of coinbase’s legal team says the company’s operations were hamstrung by the hawai‘i division of financial institutions which required coinbase “to maintain cash reserves or similar liquid assets referred to as ‘permissible investments’ in an amount equal to the aggregate face value of digital currency funds held on behalf of customers”suarez didn’t mince words in a february  statement claiming that the  dollarcollateral policy would do nothing to protect customer funds instead he claimed “compliance with this policy would siphon millions of dollars away from critical operations recruitment and retention of expert staff and constant reinvestment in the business necessary to guarantee the security of customer digital currency”the price of a single bitcoin surged in  peaking at  in december since then the price has dramatically fallen and risen many times with a huge rally in late  as mainstream businesses and financial institutions invested in the currency and began accepting it as tender paypal announced a new service enabling users to buy hold and sell cryptocurrency with hawai‘i the only state excluded from this service the price peaked at  on march   but is a few thousand dollars below that at this writingcoinbase remains one of the largest digital currency exchanges in the us by trading volume and some analysts expect a  billion valuation when the company goes public coinbase still doesn’t operate in hawai‘i though regulators in the islands are slowly opening the door for digital currency exchanges to operate herethe crypto czartoday the fate of cryptocurrency in hawai‘i depends on one woman as commissioner of financial institutions in the department of commerce and consumer affairs iris ikeda has considerable authority over the regulation of digital currency exchanges in part this is because there are no state laws designed to govern the exchanges which proliferated following the invention of bitcoin in ikeda was appointed to her position by thengov neil abercrombie in  immediately prior to her appointment she was associate counsel for american savings bank and had previously worked for finance factors and ohana pacific bank ikeda says that when she was appointed she was the first commissioner with a banking background in over  years her appointment pleased bankers she says because she understands banking and the challenges that banks faceshe was also no stranger to government her resume included stints as a researcher for thenlt gov mazie hirono and as a senior aide to honolulu city council member andy mirikitani she also had held temporary positions for the state department of labor and industrial relations and the state department of commerce and consumer affairs and she even served one term in the state house of representatives representing district  kane‘ohe to kahalu‘u from  to  after beating charles djou by  votes in the  election djou defeated ikedaikeda says her primary aim as commissioner has been to modernize the way the state interacts with financial institutions she spent her first two years moving the division of financial institutions from paperbased application processing to electronic processing equipping her staff with laptops and wifi to increase mobility now dfi uses artificial intelligence to help process licensing applications and before  dfi was already meeting with licensees using web conferencing services such as zoom and microsoft teams many financial institutions are based on the mainland and ikeda says that by handling meetings and examinations online she is able to reduce expenses and save them timein february  abercrombie thendcca chief keali‘i lopez and ikeda issued a press release following the collapse of mt gox a tokyobased cryptocurrency exchange mt gox filed for bankruptcy protection after losing  million in bitcoin it remains uncertain how much was stolen by hackers and how much was lost due to poor accounting the press release warned that “no company is licensed to transmit bitcoin in hawai‘i” and that losses related to cryptocurrency are not insured by the fdic ikeda says this was the first time the state took a public position on digital currency exchangesthe decision to regulate digital currency exchanges as money transmitters required their compliance with the cash reserve requirements that eventually pushed coinbase out of the state the departure of major exchanges left hawai‘i residents with limited options for investing in cryptocurrency and it discouraged blockchain and digital currency companies from operating in the stateikeda’s end run“since about  i’ve been ideas at the legislature to supervise or not supervise digital currency transactions under our money transmission statutes” says ikeda there are two paths she says one is to pass a law exempting digital currency exchanges from the provisions that govern money transmitters this would make her job a lot easier ikeda says another path is to define exactly how digital currency exchanges should be regulated a more complex undertakingin the  state legislative session thenrep chris lee introduced house bill  a proposal to establish a blockchain technology and digital currency working group his bill was the only measure related to digital currency introduced that session the bill suggested that “highly innovative technologies such as blockchain require an educated and measured approach so that regulations do not stymie innovation and growth” the bill crossed over to the senate and was referred to the ways and means committee where it diedthe  legislative session was the  highwater mark for efforts to regulate digital currency house bill  was carried over to the  session but it died in ways and means again companion bills were submitted in the house and senate and they survived crossover but died in conference committee two other pieces of cryptocurrency legislation didn’t survive eitherthree measures were introduced in  but none received committee hearings when the legislature failed to pursue either of the paths ikeda had laid out she set out on her own in  to study whether and how to regulate digital currency exchanges“using  the money transmitter statutes and chapter  the banking statutes i was able to convince the attorney general’s office that i had enough authority to do this pilot program” says ikeda “then i had to look for a partner”the digital currency innovation labikeda reached out to mike mccartney director of the department of business economic development  tourism mccartney introduced ikeda to len higashi acting director of the hawaii technology development corp higashi says he immediately saw a parallel between the entrepreneurs sandbox that htdc runs in kaka‘ako and the regulatory sandbox that ikeda was proposing“in software terms a sandbox is a place where you do your trial experiments it’s ok if you mess up because it’s not live yet” he says “we were blown away that this type of innovative thinking would come out of the regulatory body of the state because the state has a bad reputation of moving real slow”the htdc board agreed to partner with dfi in  and together they began planning the digital currency innovation lab participating companies would complete an application similar to the one for money transmitters and dfi would vet them in exchange for the companies providing data to dfi and complying with the terms of the program dfi would “allow the admitted digital currency issuers to conduct business in hawai‘i without first obtaining a state money transmitter license” basically dfi agreed to take “no action” in enforcing the existing statutes specifically relaxing the “permissible investments” requirement for cohort participantsthe program was announced in march  and the first cohort of  participating companies was announced in august  apex crypto bitflyer usa blockfi trading cexio cloud nalu coinme erisx flexa network gemini trust co novi financial river financial and robinhood cryptoof the twelve companies in the first cohort one was not listed among those which completed the program robinhood crypto in our interview ikeda would not refer to robinhood crypto by name instead she said that participating companies agreed to report certain data companies that did not send the required reports were removed from the program she said but only after multiple warnings and opportunities to comply with the reporting requirementsapplications for the second cohort of the digital currency innovation lab opened in january  and the structure of the program remains the same with dfi issuing a “no action message” and agreeing to “not take any action against these companies” the new cohort will be able “to conduct business in hawai‘i without the need to obtain a state money transmitter license through june  ” just shy of the election to replace gov david ige who is limited to two fouryear termsthe commissioner of financial institutions is appointed by the governor and a future governor could replace ikeda or ask her to stop the pilot program i asked ikeda whether it’s accurate to say that the governor and dfi commissioner control the future of digital currency in hawai‘i “right” she says but “not by choice that’s why we’re doing this pilot program”ikeda says she’s trying to gather information for the legislature so next year legislators can make informed decisions about whether and how to regulate digital currency companies“i see my role as an innovator trying to get in front of or at least alongside of the different innovations” says ikeda in the division of financial institutions she says “we act like a business if we think that something is not right we try to work and fix it”in march  after our interview with ikeda state rep patrick branco of district  kailua to kāne‘ohe bay introduced a resolution  requesting that dcca reconsider the asset reserve requirements for digital currency companies after the digital currency innovation lab concludes its study the resolution was adopted in the state house and as of this writing was being considered in the state senate government by blockchainlee now serves in the state senate and is still concerned with the questions that motivated him to propose the blockchain technology and digital currency working group four years ago as a member of the state house of representatives“how can we as a state and a society really empower folks in the private sector to make use of this in a way that’s meaningful and safe” he askslee sees blockchain technology as playing a crucial role in the provision of government services the ability to secure transactions through blockchain has obvious applications in voting land transactions and banking he says the question is how to update our state’s regulatory framework to allow for the adoption and use of blockchain and digital currencyhawai‘i is in a position to learn from national and international leaders in regulation says lee he participates in a group of legislators from all  states that discusses these issues online lee observes that in some cases legislatures have had to update laws regulating digital currency every legislative session “because state legislatures typically meet once a year lawmaking is just not an effective tool to keep up the pace with something that is evolving on a month to month weekly or even daily basis“we want to set up a basic legal framework that ensures protections for local residents so that the investments and the transactions they make have a sound basis” he says “beyond that we want our departments and private sector to be able to move far more rapidly“we don’t have the statutory framework that we need” lee admits “we’re still trying to figure out what that’s going to look like”globally lee says estonia is held up as an example of how government can provide online digital services secured by blockchain in that small european nation blockchain is used to secure the country’s health care registry property registry business registry succession registry digital court system and state gazette each citizen has a stateissued digital identity that allows them to access government services advocates for digital government services say blockchain security reduces personnel costs improves reliability and increases efficiency“people in estonia have greater faith in government and better quality of life” lee says and he predicts that within five to  years blockchain technology will radically improve the way that public services are provided in hawai‘i“this is part of our future whether we want to acknowledge that or not” he says “we’re all better off acknowledging it preparing for it and making sure that everybody else is aware of what’s going on and can take advantage as well”crypto’s promiseefforts are ongoing to educate the public on the promise of blockchain and digital currency though bitcoin and nfts see sidebar have made headlines recently the potential of blockchain remains untapped“we understand fiat currency very well” says ellen ng an economic development specialist with the htdc referring to governmentissued currencies like the us dollar japanese yen and british pound “but we don’t really understand what cryptocurrency is capable of”ng says that htdc is trying to educate consumers with the goal of demystifying cryptocurrency and showing its practical applicationsshe says that participants in the digital currency innovation lab have told her that they haven’t heard of many other state agencies being willing to partner with them in the way that dfi and htdc have “i think we’re pretty far out in terms of being innovative in this space” she sayshigashi concurs noting that despite hawai‘i’s late start with digital currency we have the opportunity to become a leader “we started this knowing we have to crawl before we walk” he says “we’re trying to jump from behind to the front and i think that with the lab we’re able to do that”blockchain’s many usesa blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger each new ledger entry is a “block” added to the end of the chain which records previous entriesin the case of bitcoin a decentralized network of blockchain “miners” validates new blocks when a user wants to send bitcoin their request is broadcast to the network of miners miners compete for the right to record the transaction in a new block using highpowered computers to solve a complex math problem this video offers an explanation tinyurlcombcexplain the first miner to solve the problem earns the right to add a block to the chain and is paid in bitcoin for their effort the remaining miners verify that the first miner’s answer is correct and update their copies of the blockchain accordinglythe blockchain technology that underpins bitcoin has many applications here are a fewtransferring currency the most widely known application of blockchain is to secure electronic payment systems without a financial institution serving as a trusted third party bitcoin for example uses cryptographic proof in place of trust between parties or a trusted intermediary digital currency transfer fees can be less expensive than those of traditional money transmitters like western union and transfers are instantaneous currency can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection which is useful for the  billion “unbanked” people worldwide but also for criminalssmart or selfexecuting contracts legal contracts can be converted to code and embedded within the blockchain allowing transactions without a
