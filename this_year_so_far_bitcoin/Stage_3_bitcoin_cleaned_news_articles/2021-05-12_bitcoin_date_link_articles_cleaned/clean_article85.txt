rollout fast and efficient as of tomorrow more than  pharmacies across this country will be ready to vaccinate this age groupwhile publicly waiting for the cdc and fda authorization process to play out the biden administration began quietly laying the groundwork to immediately roll out vaccines to adolescentsthat included aggressively working to sign up pediatricians and family practitioners to begin administering doses to their patients making sure pharmacies are ready to serve younger patients and reaching out to medicaid providers since  of the nations children are insured through the childrens health insurance programnotably a white house official tells npr the administration plans to make sure smaller packages of pfizer vaccines get to doctors offices as soon as they become available this has been a significant obstacle since the pfizer vaccine is currently delivered just in packages holding nearly  doses more than many private practitioners can handle pfizer has said it plans to begin shipping smaller packages by the end of this monthas summer winds down there will be an additional backtoschool push to reach young people before they return to classrooms the

while  cases occurred in those who got a placebo no serious side effects were reportedpublic health officials including those from the cdc and the independent advisers on the committee said the vaccine will further help control the coronavirus pandemic in the us and in other countries that typically follow the us lead data presented by the cdc showed that about  of  cases in the us have been in children and adolescents  years of age and youngerthe american academy of pediatrics endorsed the move in a statement read during the meetingthis is truly an exciting development that allows us to protect a large population of children and help them regain their lives after a really rough year said aap president lee savio beers as a pediatrician and a parent i have looked forward to getting my own children and patients vaccinated and i am thrilled that those ages  and older can now be protected the data continue to show that this vaccine is safe and effective i urge all parents to call their pediatrician to learn more about how to get their children and teens vaccinatedcomments from the public during an open session included questions of whether the relatively low risk of serious  complications in children justifies the use of the vaccine in this age group before more studies are performedthe study included more than  adolescents but was criticized by some public commenters for not being of sufficient size commenters also expressed concern that the studies were not sufficient to demonstrate whether there are any longterm effects associated with this or other  vaccinescdc and pfizer officials stressed study findings that show the vaccine is extremely safe in this age group paralleling what has been seen in adults for several months nowmore than  million people in the us have received at least one dose of one of the  vaccines with a very low rate of serious side effectsauthorization comes in time for summerthe authorization and endorsement come in time for many adolescents to get vaccinated before participating in summer activities such as camping and group sports efforts to get as many adolescents vaccinated as possible before school restarts in august and september are already underwayin the pediatric studies the cdc and fda evaluated the same twodose regimen separated by three weeks that is used for people age  and upwhile children and adolescents generally have milder symptoms if they contract  compared with adults they can nonetheless pass the coronavirus on to others that has parents worried about the prospect of schools fully reopening in the falli think we should be in full school full inperson school in the fall the cdcs director walensky said at a cnbc health summit on tuesdaydespite the biden administrations push to get enough americans inoculated against  to establish herd immunity the pace of vaccinations in the us has slowed in recent weeks with many adults opting not to get the shotscdc data shows that just over a third of americans are fully vaccinated with  having received at least one dose while surveys have shown that only about  to  of parents have said they plan to have their adolescent children immunized opening up vaccinations for millions of adolescents would likely get the us closer to the goal of herd immunityto aid in persuasion the white house official says the biden administration has already held webinars and listening sessions with the american academy of pediatrics and numerous education associationsthere will be more sessions this week and into next week including with the american camp association and indian health service providersover the coming days and weeks there will be tv ads social media campaigns and events with celebrities and influencers who have the ability to reach out to teens and their parents the white house declined to preview who these celebrities might behes not a celebrity by any traditional definition but us surgeon general vivek murthy is set to host a roundtable discussion with parents next week aimed at answering questions about the vaccinein march both pfizer and moderna launched pediatric trials of their vaccines in children as young as  months
