sometimes there are clear advantages to being in an allcash position and avoiding the risks in the usglobal stock markets for example you should consider cash as a position when the markets begin to execute a broad market consolidation pattern that often results in many weeks or months of sideways choppy price activity it would be best if you also considered going to cash when a more significant shift in market trends occurs putting your account at real risk should there be a  to  downside price correction moving your assets away from these risks and into cash as early as possible can save thousands of dollars in unwanted – and worse yet avoidable – losses and stressi know how everyone always says “it is better to ride out the trends and buy into the dips in the long run” well i believe there is a better way to approach these more prominent market trends it does not include riding out the massive selloffs and panicking out near the lows—watching your wealth melt away as the market’s collapse which can last in some cases like in the nasdaq over  years to reach new highswe believe the purpose of actively managing your investmentstrades should include a “cash position” as an active instrument in your portfolio why because moving your money away from risks and into a cash position can often create a major advantage for all types of investors we will get into more detail about this laterfirst we want to highlight the setup of the broad market cycletrend and bring to your attention the unique similarities in certain symbols unfolding right nowunderstanding broad market cyclesyou may have seen a version of the following stock market cycles graphic before yet surprisingly many tradersinvestors forget to reference these broader market cycles when they focus on the shortterm market trends often traders get caught up in the excitement of the rally phase and forget to anticipate the peak rollover and breakdown phase that eventually comes into playstory continuesthe rally phase we’ve seen recently in the us stock market certain global markets cryptos and commodities may have just completed the belief thrill and euphoria rally phase – reaching what we’ve been calling an “excess phase peak” if our research is correct we should expect to see a series of price patterns continue to play out over the next  to  months that complete the complacency anxiety and denial downward phases there was a recent research report entitled “how to spot the end of an excess phase” back in november  which touched on this concept as wellthe research report shared this understanding of the breakdown setup and the  phases that typically process through the euphoria complacency anxiety and denial phases and in our excess phase peak example below where we look at the nasdaq’s  peak we have labeled these phases as follows the rally to the peak – euphoria the initial breakdown and sideways flag in price – the complacency peak the breakdown to critical support – anxiety phase the extended sideways trending before the eventual breakdown of critical support – transition into the denial phase an finally the ultimate bottom sets up eventually – denial  panic phasesthe benefits of developing cash as a viable trading positiontake a look at the following example accounts that compare between staying invested in varying trends vs rolling in and out of the market throughout broad market trends in this example the “alwaysin” keeps the initial  investment fully allocated throughout bullish and bearish trends the “tradingtrends” rolls capital in and out of the market trends giving up  of each trend before altering allocation levels and continues to reinvest the full capital into new bullish trends the difference is staggering – almost  more in total returns than the “alwaysin” strategyconcluding thoughtsas markets start to churn and start a new phase you will undoubtedly hear from different advisors and financial gurus about how you should best manage your assetsin our opinion any form of more active position management is better than leaving your decisions up to another individual or chance suppose you can dedicate a few minutes a week to watch the markets or find a good trading mentor service to help you make sense of what’s happening in the markets and when to buy and sell in that case you can learn to outperform the sp consistently with only a few trades each year trading etfs which is what i like to do myselfi will highlight three very important charts on tesla tlsa apple aapl and bitcoin btc that very clearly show we may be transitioning into the complacency and anxiety phases these phases    are the excess phase peak transition and are something every trader and investor should be focusing on in my opinionif this pattern continues to play out as we expect traders and investors could be nearing a major decisionmaking time regarding how to protect profit and wealth what to do next and how to find out what the right answers are to these questionsover the next  months and beyond there are going to be incredible market moves staying ahead of these index and sector trends is going to be key to developing
