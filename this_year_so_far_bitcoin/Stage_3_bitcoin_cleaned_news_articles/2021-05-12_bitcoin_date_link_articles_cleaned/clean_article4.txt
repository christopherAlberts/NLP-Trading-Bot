bitcoin is expensive too expensive according to mike novogratz people are being put off by its high price to attract smaller savers exchanges should switch to quoting in satoshisatoshis are bitcoin’s equivalent of cents except there are far more of them just as one dollar is made up of  cents so one bitcoin is made up of  million satoshis this is defined in the bitcoin system’s original codein bitcoin’s early days when the bitcoin currency was only worth a few cents no one bothered with satoshis but now that bitcoins trade at  most people can’t afford to buy a whole bitcoin even those who can might not want to because bitcoin’s notorious volatility means they could lose much of their investmentbitcoin’s success as a store of value has been a doubleedged sword it has enriched early adopters but in the process it has raised the barriers to entry by so much that late entrants – who tend to be younger and poorer – are finding it increasingly hard to buy in just like real estate bitcoin is becoming a highyield asset for older and richer peoplefrances coppola a coindesk columnist is a freelance writer and speaker on banking finance and economics her book “the case for people’s quantitative easing” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recessionbut unlike real estate you don’t have to buy a whole bitcoin increasingly people are buying fractions of bitcoin – and fractions of bitcoin can be quoted as multiples of satoshi people who “stack sats” make regular small purchases to build up a holding already talk in terms of sats rather than bitcoin instead of buying  bitcoin they buy  million sats how many sats have you bought todaysubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policyso there’s good reason to consider switching to satoshi as the unit of account quoting in satoshi rather than bitcoin could help convince people who don’t have a great deal of money that bitcoin can still be for them despite its high price sats can become the savings vehicle of choice for ordinary people who want a safer and higheryielding place for their money than bank deposit accountsare there enough sats for everyone to have some in theory yes the world’s population is just under  billion  bitcoins have already been mined so there are  trillion sats theoretically in existence that’s about  thousand for every person on the planet on this basis therefore everyone can indeed save in satsof course it’s not quite that simple of the  million mined so far an estimated  are lost or otherwise irrecoverable and a further  million or so are never traded that leaves only about  million bitcoin available for purchase either whole or subdivided so let’s redo the math with the number of bitcoins actually available for purchase instead of  trillion satoshis there are only  trillion available for purchase that’s about  sats per personand this is where the limits of subdivisibility come into play just because something can be divided into very small pieces doesn’t mean it is practical to do so i might be able to slice a pizza down to atomic level but doing so wouldn’t solve world hunger because humans need a certain amount of food to livesimilarly there are practical limits to how much bitcoin can be subdivided  sats per person is not enough for everyone in the world to save in sats and sats wouldn’t be distributed equally among small savers anyway realistically people who have more money will be able to buy more sats and this will drive up the price pricing out those with the least money to invest so sats can’t be the sole saving vehicle for ordinary peoplethere’s another limit too which starts to bite much more quickly than the sats supply limit that limit is transaction feesas demand for bitcoin increases network traffic also increases and this raises the average transaction fee people who are buying or selling small amounts of bitcoin and therefore don’t want to pay high fees have to wait longer for their transactions to settle – if they ever settle at all higher transaction fees effectively price smaller transactions out of the market for people with not much in the way of spare us dollars this can be a huge barrier to investing in bitcointhese limits to subdivisibility raise profound questions about the nature of bitcointransaction fees are already a considerable obstacle to very small investors at bitcoin’s price of about  at the time of writing  sats are worth less than  bitcoin’s average transaction fee is about  at the time of writing and has been as high as  so  sats would be a very expensive purchase furthermore holdings smaller than this can’t be sold because the holder doesn’t own enough bitcoin to pay the transaction fee they are known as “dust” the higher the average transaction fee rises the more dust accumulates in the bitcoin ecosystemlayer  solutions aim to resolve the “dust” problem by taking small transactions offchain but i do wonder why the savings and transactions of ordinary people apparently don’t need the same anonymity security and immutability as those of the rich surely we should be protecting the wealth of ordinary people who can’t afford to lose money not the wealth of big whales for whom losses are a flea bitethese limits to subdivisibility raise profound questions about the nature of bitcoin what exactly does the community want it to be do they want it to be a reserve asset underpinning a new international payments system similar to the gold standards of the past or do they want it to be the preferred safe savings vehicle of ordinary peoplethis is essentially the same dilemma the bitcoin community faced in the “blocksize wars” of  then the argument was over whether bitcoin should accommodate the world’s transactions or whether it should simply be the base layer underpinning a new generation of transaction systems those who wanted it to be a base layer won the wars but didn’t resolve the fundamental dilemma that has now reemerged in the form of an argument about whether bitcoin should accommodate the world’s savingssubdividing into sats will resolve this dilemma for a while but if bitcoin continues on the path set in the outcome of the “blocksize wars” then transaction fees will eventually be far too high for ordinary people to save significantly in sats so bitcoin will need layer  solutions not just for transactions but for savings new products that can provide the security needed by people who can’t afford to lose moneythe crypto world is a hugely creative and innovative place i am confident there can be a solution to this dilemma i just hope it will be one that works in the best interests of the poor
