lately there’s been a lot more debate about cryptocurrency and how much energy it uses to be produced bitcoin in particular uses as much energy per year as the netherlands its carbon footprint is estimated to be the size of singapore’s and it generates as much electronic waste as the country of luxembourgall these estimates come from the bitcoin energy consumption index at digiconomist i spoke with alex de vries the founder of digiconomist who said bitcoin mining involves running millions of computations in kind of a coinproducing lottery but some cryptocurrencies like ethereum can be created in a less energyintensive way the following is an edited transcript of our conversationalex de vries photo courtesy de vriesalex de vries and what they will hope to do is to take out the mining completely they intend to make your chance of winning in the lottery depending on your wealth rather than your computational power and if they succeed in doing that you no longer need those energyhungry devices for being part of this network which would cancel  of the energy needs so it would be really great if they succeed in making that move but as it stands they’re not expecting it to finish before the end of this year or even the start of next year so we’ll have to see when they actually succeed in thatmolly wood there is a lot more attention on this now we’ve seen in fact china tried to ban cryptocurrency mining activity in parts of mongolia do you think we’ll get to a point where there could be regulation that speeds up the process of shifting to a less energyintensive mode of miningde vries i definitely think that these actions are helping the communities that are driving these changes to realize that it’s really important that they succeed because if they don’t and the energy consumption of these network keeps on growing we’re increasingly likely to see more government actionwood we should be clear that energy usage is not always the same as a lot of carbon emissions people in the industry like to talk about their increasing use of renewable energy is that a valid argument that the drive for more efficiency could cause this industry to move more quickly toward renewable energyde vries we have seen so far these mines have only obtained one significant source of renewable energy which is in the south of china during the summer months when it’s the rain season over there that’s when there is a little bit of an excess that they can take and that lasts for about four to five months the only thing is that then the dry season starts and those miners move to the north of china where they take advantage of an abundance of coalbased energy which more than negates the gains from using renewable energy in the summer and there’s no other area where they can get such a substantial amount of renewables and it’s questionable whether they’ll even be able to access these renewables in the south of china for much longer because china actually needs that to clean up the rest of the grid and they’ve been working on upgrading the infrastructure in china so they can export that energyso it’s really hard to say whether bitcoin miners are going to be using an increasing amount of renewable energy i consider that very unlikely personally and we know that more than half of this network is already using fossil fuels just very recently a coal mine incident in the north of china led to onethird of the bitcoin network going down so that shows that at the moment this is a really dirty business and we see that there is also a trend towards bitcoin miners using obsolete fossil fuels we’ve seen that in several areas — in montana in new york very recently and even kentucky thought it was a great idea to try to attract these miners to save their obsolete coal fields so i don’t see a trend to renewables in this current energy transition we need renewables so we don’t have an excess of that but we do have an excess of obsolete fossil fuels and they would be better left in the ground but some of these miners will love to take advantage of the availability because it’s both cheap and also constantly available these miners don’t just need cheap energy they also want constant power which is something really hard to provide with for example solar energywood i want to clarify what i’m pretty sure i heard there so you have states for example in the us that have a lot of excess fossil fuels you have cryptocurrency miners in search of cheap excess power and these states are saying “come here use our coal burn more carbon” to create what is at least right now basically just an asset classde vries yeah exactly this was literally what happened very recently in kentucky where they converted a cleanenergy subsidy into a tax break for bitcoin miners because they think it’s great that this industry uses a lot of energy  and they wanted to save some jobs from the obsolete coal plants so yeah that’s also an interesting development where you have governments thinking of this as an opportunity to save obsolete fossil fuels and maybe save some jobs in the processwood obviously people who are involved in cryptocurrency are very passionate about it and they say “look in five years this will all be worth it because we will have decentralized money” and for the tens of millions of people who are using cryptocurrency to do remittances without banks interfering it’s totally worth it is there any scenario in which this new invention is worth this energy consumptionde vries they will have to solve some other issues as well first because if you look at bitcoin it’s not capable of handling a whole lot of transactions it’s actually limited to a processing capacity of just seven transactions per second if you compare that to a payment provider like visa they can do  transactions per second if needed so right now bitcoin can’t even replace a bunch of small banks and if they don’t increase that in some way it will never be capable of doing that so this is another issue that the community will have to address — how do you scale distributed software and if they can’t solve it then you can’t do much more with bitcoin than speculate on itwood should we ban itde vries well there’s several things you can do we know that these miners are flocking to the same locations because they all want the same cheap sources of energy and you can throw them off your grid that will drive up the cost of mining but it will not completely stop mining because ultimately people can still run these machines in their own houses if everything else is banned you can still run it at home which would mean a lot less energy consumption but it would still happen so that leaves only one option which is you could ban people from investing in these currencies altogether and make it impossible to invest in bitcoin and ethereum which would subsequently most likely if sufficient countries go along with that crash the value of these currencies and if the currency value crashes so does the income that goes to miners and if miners get no money they can’t pay for electricity either so that would also be a very nuclear option but it’s definitely a possibilitya physical imitation of the ethereum cryptocurrency ina fassbendergetty imagesrelated links more insight from molly woodthere’s a devastating piece in climate coverage outlet grist about a power plant in dresden new york that’s only operational because of bitcoin after being shut down in  for a lack of fossil fuel demandrecently harvard business review published a bit of a rebuttal of which there are many on this energy question the piece asks how much energy a monetary system should consume and then points out that as i mentioned energy usage isn’t necessarily carbon emissions the cambridge centre for alternative finance estimated last september that  of total energy consumption by crypto miners or hashers as it calls them is powered by renewable energy something like  of mining activity involves some renewable energy according to the cambridge centre report which also says the topic is typically misrepresented in most sources and “on both sides of the debate” but the short version is there is some renewable energy at play but there’s still too much energy usage overall and so far who is benefiting from the existence of cryptocurrencies mostly investors and speculatorsand even if the ultimate goal is to revolutionize and replace the financial system with decentralized currency that anyone can use anywhere that’s still a ways off and we have a rapidly warming planet and right now it’s rich people getting richer and the planet warming faster so is it worth iton that note there’s a brutal medium piece about nfts and crypto art which also consumes a ton of energy to create and which the author refers to given our climate emergency as a “crime against humanity” it also does a good job of explaining how crypto mining uses so much energy and if you want an even more concise version i leave you with this from alex de vries explaining “proof of work” and why it requires so many computersde vries well it always sounds a little bit complicated when you start about proofofwork mining and technical terms like that but that’s essentially what’s going on in bitcoin bitcoin is an open network nobody’s controlling it and you need a way to align an open network where anyone can just participate and proofofwork mining is a way to do it it’s first of all a reward system so if you turn your computer hardware to participate in creating new blocks of transactions for the bitcoin blockchain you can earn a reward for that each block that is created pays a reward of around  bitcoins times the current rate of around   a substantial reward especially considering it’s on average once every  minutes that a block is being created but then the thing is that the protocol the bitcoin protocol also makes it really hard to obtain that reward and now what miners are really doing what i always say is they’re sort of participating in what is essentially a massive lottery it’s a process of trial and error where they have to guess the winning number that will allow them to create the next block for the blockchain so they’re just making guesses constantly the whole network the bitcoin network is making  quintillion guesses every second of the day nonstop trying to create the next block for the blockchain and that process just goes on and repeats after every new block and that’s why you have millions of devices around the world making those guesses and consuming a lot of energy in the backgroundwood and it’s also my understanding that the more bitcoin is created the more complex the creation process gets right it used to be that i had friends who built really powerful pcs and were doing mining at home and it caused their home energy to spike but now it takes a data centerde vries yes that’s also because these parties are no longer people like you and me that are just using their hardware that was very much in the beginning early days of bitcoin that anyone can use their computer hardware to participate but by now it’s such a competitive process where everyone’s looking for the cheapest sources of electricity taking advantage of economies of scale so what happens is that a big chunk of this network is located in china taking advantage of really cheap energy over there and also taking advantage of the fact that it’s more efficient to cool  devices than it is to cool a single one and that’s why you can’t compete with that anymore if you’re just running these machines at your house
