gopixa  istockcomblockchain has seen a staggering rise in popularity since bitcoin the first cryptocurrency launched in  blockchain has a number of advantages including decentralization and security the demand for a decentralized currency has catapulted bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to worldwide popularityread bitcoin cash bch how’s it differ from bitcoin and what’s it worthbut blockchain has its limitations these systems are inherently closed off from the rest of the world which is good for security and integrity but also limits the input data they can acceptthus there is a need for a sort of bridge that can help these systems see what is happening in the outside world but in order for the system to work the input cannot come from a single source why because it would then rely on a centralized source of data which goes against the very nature of blockchainsee india proposes ban on bitcoin — and the us could be nextthat is the very problem chainlink can help solve as we will find outwhat is chainlinkchainlink is a decentralized oracle network that is poised to play an important role in the realworld implementation of blockchain technologies the purpose of this network is to provide input on a variety of external sources of dataalthough blockchain is great at what it does — providing a decentralized secure ledger for digital transactions — it isn’t so great at taking input for things happening outside the blockchain there are many “offchain” forces that influence markets including fiat currencies credit cards and even the weather and sports scores as a decentralized oracle chainlink can provide input to what’s known as smart contractsfind out why some money experts believe in bitcoin and others don’tthese smart contracts help the system respond to a wide range of input if x do y as the first cryptocurrency bitcoin and its corresponding blockchain can only process a small range of this input but newer blockchains such as ethereum have a wider range that includes support for programmable smart contractsstory continueson that note chainlink was launched on the ethereum blockchain in  but it is meant to be agnostic thus it can work with other blockchains toowhat is link and what is it worthlink is chainlink’s native token the token is meant to help finance the growth of the project and is similar to bitcoin btc and ethereum eth both of these cryptocurrencies work on their respective blockchains just like btc and eth act as an incentive for users to mine link does the samemore the hype around nfts what are they and how pricey do they getthe link token launched in  with a price under  cents and remained under  until  in  the price began to rise precipitously in fact the price increased from under  in early  to a high of  on feb  despite link’s meteoric rise though it has since dropped from its high of  and hasn’t yet reached that level again in fact the price dropped nearly  by march  should you invest in linkas you may have gathered from the above the value of link remains volatile despite its huge gains since early  therefore it may be best to invest in link only as a way to support the underlying technology otherwise the high degree of volatility may be too much to bear for most investorsread how does cryptocurrency work – and is it safenevertheless chainlink looks to be an important technology as cryptocurrencies continue to evolve having an oracle such as chainlink in place will be key to the longterm stability and viability of cryptocurrency in general thus link may be a sound investment if you believe chainlink will become the industry standard as the most widelyused decentralized oracle networkthis article is part of gobankingrates’ ‘economy explained’ series to help readers navigate the complexities of our financial systemmore from gobankingrateslast updated april  this article originally appeared on gobankingratescom what is chainlink and why is it important in the world of cryptocurrency
