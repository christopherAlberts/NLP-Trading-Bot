good better best never let it rest til your good is better and your better is best st jerome of stridonrough roadsnot that the performance is or has been bad far from it what the road is is bumpy with twists turns and intersections at crossroads with no road signs hate that still better than a straight punch in the mouth when you are looking the other way sunday night has long since said its goodbyes monday morning is official yet first we must traverse what most folks refer to as the wee or zero darkthirty hours in military jargoni had expected the lead story this morning to be the plunge in bitcoin in dollar terms over the weekend and that may still be the actual lead from a market centered perspective however public fascination with professional sport has catapulted the possible creation of a soccer super league into the headlines the creation of a league that would include the  or so wealthiest clubs across europe apparently at the expense at least in terms of prestige of the leagues that these teams would be drawn from these national leagues appear to oppose the idea as a fan i would love to see such an idea come to baseball a true world series that would be coolback to bitcoin the worlds most famous and valuable cryptocurrency plunged to levels below  at one point on sunday dragging much of the cryptosphere along with it there were many opinions cast about surmising on why there had been such a plunge perhaps the most obvious might be that a large holder or large holders had planned all along to take some profits after the coinbase global coin public listing at the nasdaq market site there were also rumors bouncing around on social media that the us treasury might be looking into dark side usage of cryptocurrencies been expecting that shoe to drop since forever there has been no comment from the department there were also outages across china western china in particular that cut back on mining for cryptos including an outright ban that was to go into effect across the inner mongolia region in april announced back in late februaryearly march one would think that might actually spike the value of such virtual assets unless there were fears that such bans would spread beyond asia all that said bitcoin itself appears to be stabilizing if not recovering overnightpandemic related news over the weekend was quite the mix between the good and the bad from a global perspective the viral spread has never been more aggressive as large nations such as brazil and india notably struggle to flatten their respective curves the rate of mortality is truly frightening in brazil not to mention the many smaller poorer nations also left with little more than physical mitigation as a means of defenseunfortunately even in mature economies such as the us where the vaccines are much more accessible and canadianbased numera analytics now projects herd us immunity within  months should the  coronavirus continue to spread anywhere it will also mutate eventually either rendering itself best case less deadly as a means of survival or worst case finding a way around currently available vaccines and their successorsthat said dr anthony fauci did the media circuit over the weekend telling abc news i would think that were not gonna go beyond friday in the extension of this pause when discussing the one shot easier to handle johnson  johnson jnj vaccine a key to global distribution fauci is both the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid but also serves as the chief medical advisor to president biden opined later in the interview that he was not interested in speaking for the regulatory agencies involved the cdc and fda but he felt that the jnj jab would be back with some sort of indication a little bit different from before the pause my interpretation they had to pause this shot in order to inform the public as well as medical professionals of this previously unknown risk and how not to treat it where and when it does arisein addition australia and new zealand launched the transtasman travel bubble where travelers can move between the two nations without quarantine after more than a year of closed borders good as someone who has adopted the world of online spin classes as a means of fighting through long haul postcovid and has gotten to the point of needing something a little more challenging that what peloton pton thinks is advanced this should breathe more life into new zealands les mills on demand as perhaps some of their instructors might return to new zealand now i do not need the peloton cult coming after me its a great streaming fitness app i use my own equipment with the deepest library i know of fantastic for warming upcooling down running and stretching that said for spin lmod is on a different level im sticking with them both rather than returning to a gymmarketsthe marketplace responded well to the first week of earnings season or should we say what we saw beyond the banks that dominated week one from  feet the dow industrials sp  nasdaq composite nasdaq  sp  and sp  all showed off gains of  or more the russell  came close why one us domestic macro for the most part hit beast mode march retail sales march housing starts and april regional manufacturing surveys all exploded higher while first time claims for unemployment benefits plummetedin addition as these datapoints hit publication the atlanta fed took its gdpnow estimate for  gdp from  to  where it will stay all week as sell side analysts took projected sp  earnings significantly higher for the period currently being reported according to factset over the course of just last week estimates for  earnings growth moved from  to  while projected revenue growth moved from  to  estimates moved higher for all subsequent quarters of this  year as well consensus for  earnings growth now stands at an incredible  while full year projections have moved to sweet nothingstheres always a yet yet all of your favorite largecap indices either hit or neared new records not a big deal anymore there were visible dings and dents in the armor the dow transports for one closed unchanged not just on friday but for the week using sector select spdr etfs as proxies for market performance utilities took over market leadership xlu  with health care xlv  and the reits xlre placing in third and fourth place of the  sectors at least in the case of utilities and reits this is an interest rates story thats why the financials xlf  though in terms of profitability having ripped the cover off of the ball still finished in eight place where was growth technology xlk placed ninth and communications services xlc finished dead last down for the week the only sector closing in the red for three of five daysdefensive posturing does not usually lead to higher market highs yet theres that word again sentiment is cherry almost euphoric hey trading volume finally returned but then again that was in support of a not so obvious rotation into defense oh and we mentioned interest rates as we did in this space on friday we know that foreign accounts pounded us treasury securities in february and march now we believe that foreign accounts have led the charge back into both the middle and long end of the yield curve flight to quality no doubt as the us is ahead of most of the developed world in terms of vaccination and potential economic reopening still it becomes hard to believe in the growthinflation story truly playing out organically exgovernment spending beyond this immediate transitory stage if the cost of credit over time does not play along now we believe that japanese accounts plowed into us treasuries for a domestic calendar based technical reason does this foreign appetite spread probably as long as the nominal gap between foreign suppressed rates and us not as suppressed rates remain hedgeable large after adjusting for currency exchange rateswhat if i explained to you  most of you already know  that historically a rsi relative strength reading of  indicates a technically overbought condition a reading of  the threshold of being technically oversold and a reading of  being precisely neutral what if i then told you that among our  sector select spdr etfs five now show readings in the  while two more are just below at  and change what if three more are in the middle  and just one energy xle at a reading of  is even close to neutral knowing that posture has turned defensive and the treasury yield curve has flattened you might expect the same kind of profit taking that hit bitcoin over the weekend to extend to equities even if earnings continue to impress even if the macro stays hot remember the fomc has gone into their blackout period ahead of the april  policy statementwhat does that mean it means that every time investors get jumpy this week there wont be a williams or an evans or a barinard around to
