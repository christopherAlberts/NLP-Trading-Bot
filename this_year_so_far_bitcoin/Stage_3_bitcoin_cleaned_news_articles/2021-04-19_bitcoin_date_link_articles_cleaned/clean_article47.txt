how he loves bitcoin’s equality and why it’s great he explained that everyone stacks the sats they deserve it’s another form of proof of work you put in the work to earn fiat or bitcoin straight up to then buy and hodl bitcoin you get to choose how much effort you put into stacking and no one has an advantage over you everyone plays by the same rules and no one can change that it is up to the individual now to stack as much as they wantwe go into how rules not rulers are what is important to bitcoin we discussed how bitcoin levels the playing field and why i think the plebs are going to dominate in the future why because they are hardworking smart and passionate individuals who do what’s best for ourselves and bitcoin this conversation got me really bullish and i know it will make you bullish as wellbelow are some of littlest’s most interesting thoughts shared during the interview and be sure to check out the full episode for morehow did you find bitcoin and fall down the rabbit holethe short version is a series of poor life choices put me on a path a few years back that i slowly came to realize wasn’t going to get my life where i wanted it and wasn’t going to provide the life that my wife and kids deserve poor selfdiscipline and no financial knowledge put me on a path to ruin that started affecting my relationships that came to a head in  i met with councilors mental and financial and got my spending under control and it was amazing how quickly my mental health turned around — things got betterwhen i started to get ahead in life i started thinking about the future which led me to learn more about bitcoin and some altcoins i have always been into tech so i knew about bitcoin but jumping into bitcoin twitter and youtube opened my eyes to how corrupt the fiat system was and how if i didn’t put my money somewhere safe it wouldn’t matter if i turned my life around or not if my savings became worth  like many i did get into a few alts under that “get rich quick” mentality but after a few months of podcasts articles etc it was clear that the vision of bitcoin was vital and it’s what made it special and different from the shitcoinsi dumped my bags into bitcoin and have been a maximalist ever since i was very lucky but a number of people have told me it was strange that i got in during a bear market when the hype is low what made a huge difference and i can’t stress this enough was the upcoming halving while i like the “ngu tech” memes as much as everyone else the halving events are the best time to learn about bitcoin from the outside because the chatter is focused on the “why” of the halving and why these events make bitcoin the best money the world has ever knownhow has bitcoin changed your lifethis is explained in a thread i did a couple of weeks back that seemed to really resonate with people the biggest way that bitcoin has changed my life is simple — when you are hopeful for the future you can escape nihilism and become who you are supposed to be once i came to the conclusion that bitcoin was the only thing that is going to save us from corrupt governments and disastrous federal bank policies and i had a stake in this revolution it allowed me to continue focusing on myself and my relationships and kept me from relapsing back into bad habits that had threatened to destroy the life i wanted to have when you have hope for the future you work hard to make sure that the future is bright that’s what bitcoin did for mewhat is the most amazing thing about bitcoin to youequality you can reference  ways the fiat system is stacked against regular people call it the cantillon effect nepotism elitism whatever even being lucky enough to be born into a middle class in a western country so many things about our system are stacked against us with the hard cap of  million coins regular people have a chance to become part of a system that doesn’t care if people were born millionaires have a parent that is head of a central bank or are millionaire athletes grab your sats and hodl and the deflationary rules of bitcoin will make sure your wealth growswhat are you most looking forward to in the bitcoin spacei am looking forward to new businesses and services built by people within the bitcoin space sure it’s cool that paypal and visa are getting into the game but it’s by their old rules and their old assumptions coming from a fiat system companies like btcpay fold cryptocloaks privacy pros bitpiggy and projects like the lightning network are building their models around bitcoin and using it as a starting point these are the companies that are going to be out ahead with strong community support and great models moving into the future i guess my answer is i am looking forward to more companies by bitcoiners for bitcoinerswhat is your price prediction for the end of  and the end of ah how to answer this without being yelled at for being bearish since the price flattened out a couple of weeks ago it has been moving from  to  here in canada so i don’t see any way it doesn’t hit well above  in the great white north by the end of  as far as  goes i can honestly say i don’t care it’s going to be some foolishly high “we told you so” number and we will all look back at these shitposting days on twitter with fondness as we quietly smile at nocoiners spending thousands of dollars for a handful of sats
