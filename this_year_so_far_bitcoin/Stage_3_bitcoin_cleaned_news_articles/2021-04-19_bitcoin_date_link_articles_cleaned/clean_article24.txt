mining interests have called watkins glen officials in recent weeks to explore the possibility of setting up a cryptocurrency processing operation within the village to take advantage of its cheap electric ratesthe village enjoys a monthly allocation of about  megawatts of hydroelectric power that costs residents only about  cents per kilowatt well under half the rate nyseg chargestalks with the miners are at a preliminary stage and there may not be any suitable sites officials said but the expressed interest prompted schuyler county legislators to draft a resolution — tabled on april  — calling on the state department of environmental conservation to issue statewide regulations for cryptocurrency miningmeanwhile the village trustees recently voted  against a resolution calling for a moratorium on expanding bitcoin mining operation at the greenidge generation power plant in dresdenthe plant houses about  computer servers that validate and record bitcoin transactions using  megawatts of its total  capacity the company is seeking local permits in yates county to build four new buildings to add server capacity and it has told potential investors that it expects its miners to draw  megawatts of power before the end of next yearlocal environmental groups have sued to try to block the expansion they have warned that the increased power use will boost warm water discharges which may promote toxic algal blooms furthermore added energy use will raise air emissions likely leading to conflict with the state law that calls for a  percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by last week the law group earthjustice and the sierra club warned that the dec’s stance on greenidge’s pending applications to renew its air permits would set an important precedent for nearly  other older fossil fuel power plants in new york state that could convert into energyhungry bitcoin mining or data center operations with the price of bitcoin more than doubling this year conversions are particularly alluringa spokesman for greenidge dismissed the concern earthjustice and sierra club raised in a letter to the governor and dec officialsbut in an application filed thursday a canadian bitcoin miner asked the state public service commission to approve its planned takeover of a  natural gasfueled power plant in north tonawanda just north of buffaloif and when the deal closes it would create the state’s — and perhaps the nation’s — second bitcoin minerowed power plant greenidge was firstdigihost international a british colombia company said in a mar  press release that it has

announced plans to become a publicly traded company like digihost through a reverse merger with supportcom that’s set to close in the third quarterany bitcoin operation in watkins glen would be far smaller than the power plant operations“there have been inquiries from cryptomining operations wishing to set up within the limits of watkins glen because of its cheap power” schuyler county legislator mark rodinaro told jimmy jordan of wrfi community radio news recently “none have come to fruition but there have definitely been inquiries”rodinaro did not return calls from waterfrontminard lafever electric department supervisor for the village of watkins glen said he’d received two calls within the past three weeks from bitcoin representatives — one seeking real estate information the other asking about power sources“they can’t just pop in anywhere because our infrastructure will not sustain loads in some areas” lafever saidduring periods of peak demand the village uses about  mw of power for decades it has received an allocation of about  megawatts of niagara hydropower which costs residents about  cents a kilowatthourwhen the village exceeds its hydro allotment it qualifies for purchased power from the new york power authority which varies between  cents per kilowatthour still far below the nyseg rate of  centsone major customer walmart doesn’t share in the hydro power it agreed to settle for a somewhat higher negotiated purchased power rate so that it didn’t consume the valuable discount that residents and small businesses enjoy“if bitcoin did come to watkins” lefever said “it would probably fall under the same or nearly same rate classification as walmart”rondinaro told wrfi that if the hydro allocation were to expire or to be transferred the cost of doing business in the village would jump“some of them might no longer be viable” he said “and those are operations that employ large numbers of people”asked if he considered the talks with the bitcoin officials still active lafever said “i’d say it is it’s not run its course yet something could arise out of this”the schuyler county legislature’s tabled resolution called for all cryptocurrency mining operations within new york state to be powered solely by renewable energy wind solar geothermal or hydro
