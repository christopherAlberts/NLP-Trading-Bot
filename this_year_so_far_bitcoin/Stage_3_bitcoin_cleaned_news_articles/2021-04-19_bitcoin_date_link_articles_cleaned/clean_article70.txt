originally published on october  updated on march  introductionthere exists no uniformity with respect to how businesses that deal in virtual currencies also known as cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are treated among the states for these proprietors often the first question asked when deciding whether to operate within a state is whether existing state money transmitter rules apply to the sale or exchange of virtual currencies as you will see from the discussion below most states have not yet enacted regulations that provides virtual currency operators with any guidance on this questionsome states have issued guidance opinion letters or other information from their financial regulatory agencies regarding whether virtual currencies are money under existing state rules while others have enacted piecemeal legislation amending existing definitions to either specifically include or exclude digital currencies from the definition to use a pun those in the blockchain space should understand there is a complete lack of consensus as to whether they do or not this uncertainty is made all the more complicated by potentially contradictory guidance from the federal government for example in march  the financial crimes enforcement network fincen published a letter stating that token issuers were money transmitters required to follow federal money transmitter requirements the letter came just two days after a us district court in new york accepted the understanding of the commodity futures trading commission cftc that cryptocurrencies were commodities a ruling that on its face appears to take the exchange of cryptocurrencies for fiat currency outside of the definition of money transmission under previous fincen and now questionable past guidance see eg application of the definition of money transmitter to brokers and dealers in currency and other commodities  sept  the few states that have attempted to enact comprehensive regulations including new yorks much maligned bitlicense scheme has resulted in an exodus of blockchain and virtual currency businesses from states attempting to treat all virtual currency operators identically with traditional money transmitters that are better equipped to deal with an overly restrictive regulatory framework there is a proposal pending within the ny state assembly to replace the bitlicense with a more innovationfriendly framework and indeed the new york department of financial services has in practice become more friendly to bitlicense applicants on the other end of the spectrum several states have enacted cryptofriendly regulations in an attempt to entice entrepreneurs to move to their state wyoming has emerged as the most innovative crypto jurisdiction going so far as to claim it is trying to be to the crypto industry what delaware is to corporations among the regulations the state has enacted are laws that exempt utility tokens from state securities regulation and virtual currencies from state money transmission laws creates a statechartered depository institution to provide banking services to virtual currency companies adopts a framework by which wyoming banks can act as qualified custodians for digital assets and creates a fintech sandbox to allow further innovations in the space most recently a firstofitskind regulation was proposed by the state that would grant limited liability status to decentralized autonomous organizations that register in the statethe authors of this article are hopeful that over the next several years states will begin to craft regulation that balances the dual needs of protecting consumers from businesses operating in the fledgling industry while also promoting continued innovation by not saddling virtual currency businesses with regulatory burdens that make it financially impractical to operate one attempt to craft such legislation has been proposed by the uniform law commission which in july  introduced a model regulation of virtual currency businesses act the model legislation had been adopted by a few states including hawaii and has been supported by the american bar association but after receiving criticism from states like wyoming and missouri over its model legislation the ulc asked states to hold off on enacting its model rules to allow the commission time to further study the issue the debate over the ulc is emblematic of the differences of opinion on the best way to enact legislation addressing blockchain and virtual currency technologies and the challenges of even reaching legislative consensus over fundamental concepts such as the definitions of virtual currency or the types of activities or economic thresholds that could be implemented for virtual currency business activitythis article attempts to outline the range of regulations or guidance provided by the states with regard to virtual currency regulations or blockchain specific technologies because the law is rapidly developing we will try
