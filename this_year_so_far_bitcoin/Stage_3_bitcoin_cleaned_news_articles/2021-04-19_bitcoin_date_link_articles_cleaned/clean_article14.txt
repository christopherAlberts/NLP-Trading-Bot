toronto ontario and brossard quebec april   globe newswire  bitfarms ltd “bitfarms” or the “company”  tsxvbitf  otcbfarf  today provides an update regarding its expansion project in south americaon october   bitfarms announced the signing of a nonbinding memorandum of understanding to secure electricity at approximately  per kwh with the plan to pursue the development of a  mw bitcoin mining facility in argentina during the past sixmonths considerable due diligence and contractual work has been undertaken to determine the viability of the expansion projectthe company has since signed a significantly enhanced power purchase agreement with a utilitygrade private power producer in argentina pursuant to which bitfarms is entitled to draw up to  mw of electricity at its discretion the initial term of the contract is eight years during the first four years the effective cost of the electricity will be  per kwhwith a favourable yearround climate the facility in argentina does not require expensive liquid immersion cooling to keep the miners cool and operating optimally the miners will be cooled with fans similar to how they are cooled in our facilities in québecbitfarms is in advanced contractual discussions with a construction company experienced in utilitygrade electrical infrastructure and civil construction to design and build the electrical interconnection the highvoltage electrical lines and transformers needed for our operations we are working on finalizing an engineering procurement and construction contract with the aim of mining bitcoin in early  at the new facilitythe company is in advanced discussions with an experienced engineering services company to monitor construction and ensure that quality and keymilestones are achievedthe proposed new mining facility is in very close proximity to the utility and as such the electricity contract does not involve any interconnection with the local power grid which has the advantage that electricity cannot be curtailed during times of unusually high usage this means that our miners can be operated with maximum efficiency and output regardless of conditions applicable to the local power gridbitfarms plans to relocate a substantial number of its older miners to the new data centre while the older miners are less efficient than the new miners the low cost of electrical power and the proven reliability of these miners will extend their economic life this strategy will allow our older miners to continue to be accretive to cash flow from operations and to contribute to bitfarms’ overall corporate hashratea substantial portion of the recently ordered  microbt miners as announced on march   are earmarked for the new facility mw is sufficient to support approximately  newgeneration miners which could generate approximately  million of revenues or  bitcoin based on current difficulty levels and a bitcoin price of as a basis of comparison we previously reported the breakeven cost to mine a bitcoin during the fourth quarter of  was approximately  in québec if the new argentina facility was operating during the same period we estimate the breakeven cost to mine the same bitcoin would have been  a  savings as compared to québecwith up to  mw of lowcost power available to us the argentina facility is expected to be a significant contributor to bitfarms achieving its  ehs target by the end of  it is also intended to provide geographic production diversification to reduce risk and serve as an effective hedge for bitfarms against the next halving event
