bernie madoff who died wednesday will be justly remembered as one of the biggest scam artists in the history of capitalism his massive decadeslong ponzi scheme ended up costing investors tens of billions of dollars and in the process wrecked many lives but these days madoff also looks like something else a man whose moneymaking scheme was an odd forerunner of the hottest and strangest investment crazes of the momentthese days madoff also looks like something else a man whose moneymaking scheme was an odd forerunner of the hottest and strangest investment crazes of the momentmadoff was a classic ponzi artist he raised money by promising his clients that he had a special proprietary investment strategy one that allowed him to make money consistently in any kind of market but the strategy was an illusion as were the investment gains instead madoff paid off his old investors with the money he raised from newer ones while skimming something off the top for himself this is a hard thing to keep going for a long period of time but madoff was smart — instead of promising his clients massive gains he promised reasonable but stable returns and he worked assiduously with investment managers who could keep bringing him new clients and new money it wasnt until the global financial crisis hit and his clients demanded en masse to pull their money out of his investment funds that the house of cards madoff had built collapsedat its core then madoffs scheme depended on a simple idea as long as you can keep new investors coming in and old ones from cashing out you can make an illusion seem real and that as it turns out is the same idea that has animated a host of speculative frenzies in the past year the booms in socalled meme stocks nonfungible tokens or nfts and cryptocurrencies like dogecoin are in some sense legal ponzi schemes writ large in which the value of the underlying assets is little more than a wager that new money will keep coming into the markettake the cryptocurrency dogecoin it was created back in  as literally a joke a satire on cryptocurrencies like bitcoin it got its name from doge a popular meme thats the image of a shiba inu dog looking sideways at the camera for years people would trade it back and forth mainly just for the hell of it but over the past few months thanks in large part to tweets by tesla ceo elon musk speculators started buying dogecoin as its price rose more people started to pay attention and the price kept rising last week it rose by more than  percent putting it up by a mere  percent this year friday afternoon the total value of dogecoins topped  billionwhy there is no good answer to that question other than to say dogecoins have gotten dramatically more valuable because people have decided to act as if theyre more valuable but the important point is that the only way that value can be sustained let alone continue to rise is if the people who hold it dont all rush to sell and if new money keeps flooding in just as with madoff if the people who think theyve gotten rich owning dogecoin try to cash out en masse the whole thing will come tumbling downthe same is true in many ways of the sudden craze for nfts which you might think of as digital certificates for things like digital art digital sports trading cards and limitedseries musical albums like dogecoin nfts have been around for years but beginning in late  the value of nfts exploded from october to early april the average selling price of nfts rose roughly tenfold culminating in the sale of a  piece of digital art for  million suddenly everyone and their cousin is rushing to cash in on the frenzy issuing nfts not just of digital art but also of magazine covers toilet paper ads and most notoriously an audio clip of a year of someones fartsneedless to say whats driving this frenzy isnt the intrinsic value of fart clips or even nba highlights which you can watch free on youtube or nbacom without buying an nft instead nft speculators are betting that people in the future will be willing to pay more for their nft than they did originally because those people will think that someone else in the future will in turn be willing to pay more for the nft than they did its a market that depends entirely on the prospect of new money continuing to flow innow you might ask isnt this just the way all markets work — prices rise because new investors come in but this misses a fundamental difference between things like stocks and bonds and assets like dogecoin or nfts when you buy a stock youre purchasing a share of an actual business and its future profits stock prices can get out of whack of course soaring far above the true value of a companys business but because there is a business underlying the stock price even an inflated stock has an intrinsic value that dogecoin doesnt the same is even more obviously true of bonds in which you get regular interest payments and the guarantee that the company or the government that issued the bonds will eventually buy them backit’s a market that depends entirely on the prospect of new money continuing to flow inin todays speculative booms by contrast value is understood as something that can in effect be created out of whole cloth as long as people agree that something is valuable they can make it valuable and as long as you can hold down the number of people who want to cash out you can keep it valuable for a surprisingly long timeto be clear there is an important difference between what bernie madoff did and what you might call ponzi markets madoffs investors for the most part had no idea they were part of a ponzi scheme while lots of the people buying these newfangled assets are to some extent doing it with their eyes open theyre speculators who are well aware that theyre playing a game but what isnt any different is that this game can continue only as long as people are willing to play when they arent willing to do that — because people decide to cash out or panic or just get bored — the game will end just like madoffs scheme didwe may already be seeing that in the market for nfts — in march daily sales of art nfts were down by roughly  percent according to nonfungiblecom and at that point the people with bad luck or bad timing inevitably will lose its like wile e coyote running off a cliff he can keep going until the moment he realizes theres no ground beneath him when he does he falls and its a long long way down
