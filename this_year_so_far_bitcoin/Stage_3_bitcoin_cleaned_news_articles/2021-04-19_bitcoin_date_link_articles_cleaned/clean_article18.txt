bitcoin prices recovered some losses after plunging swiftly over the weekend the cryptocurrency sank as much as  on sunday and other major coins like ether and xrp also droppedvideo transcriptjulie hyman but first lets get into the action in cryptocurrencies indeed we did see a pullback this weekend bitcoin dropping as much as  over the weekend after regaining some of those declines and remember of course cryptocurrency is one of the few things that trade all the time including over the weekend so we tend to see volatility at times when other things arent open and cant be volatileand as usual with crypto right guys theres not usually sort of one catalyst reason there were a lot of fingers being pointed over the weekend to concerns about regulation in various places turkey saying its not going to allow the use of crypto as a payment so perhaps that fit into it but just generally sort of a lot of concern about where things kind of go from here but for the crypto believers a pullback like this doesnt seem to be a big source of concern mylesmyles udland yeah and i mean i said it on twitter half jokingly but i actually do mean this that everyone we talked to in crypto right they come on and one of the main things they reiterate is that cryptocurrency can be extremely volatile and its not suitable for everybody so on and so forth i mean i take that to be when a crypto calls i means crypto falls  on a saturday night do not call me and ask why because no ones really going to be able to tell you a satisfying answer so lets just not talk about a  or  pullbackand i think thats sort of how the space is going to move forward from this well probably be bitcoin  in a couple of weeks and no one will really care what happened on the weekend after coinbase went public maybe it was you know some of the data from open insider which is you know a great website and it tracks insider buys and sells of various stocks and there was a chart or table they had that showed brian armstrong selling about  million shares worth of coinbasestory continuesand the way that it went to that site via sec filings calculated his stake it implied that armstrong sold  of his position in coinbase when in fact he sold the equivalent of about  and  of his position in coinbase so he really didnt sell any of his position at all right effectively so maybe that played into it but i think we could all throw out different ideas around why crypto went up down why doge is doing whatever doge is doingand sozzi to me ultimately it comes back to no one knows no one cares and dont ask because its just going to end up in a circular nonproductive conversation wherein those who are bullish say theyre still bullish and those who hate crypto are going to come out and say they hate it for all these different reasonsbrian sozzi i would say myles this weekend of activity is a good learning lesson for all those folks that got caught up in the craze last week they saw coinbase ipo they saw potentially paying off their kids college future over the course of a day theyre out there buying dogecoin theyre out there buying coinbase theyre out there trading bitcoin have absolutely no clue what theyre buying why theyre buying it theyre simply buying it because everybody else is buying it and those people are telling them to buy itso this weekend i think is a wake up call that you have to do more work on bitcoin you have to drill down into what our fundamentals are there in fact in bitcoin you have to also do a lot of work on terms of sentiment its not ok to just go to one bitcoin website and read up whats going on and pull the trigger on a trade i mean theres a lot of nuances into this its not like investing in a public company its just not theres no corporate financials here it is what it is its sentiment driven and you can get burned very quickly and a lot of people likely didjulie hyman come on brian sozzi dig into the fundamentals come onbrian sozzi yeahjulie hyman people are buying it because it keeps going up thats why people are buying it and i think you cant i dont know how do you even like i dont even know how you would dig into it its just its a psychological phenomenon i dont know i think theres a not that im not saying people should be putting all their money in this thing but it theres i dont even know how you would do thatbrian sozzi and thats a problem and thats a problem for investing in this stuffjulie hyman maybe maybe not it hasmyles udland its julie hyman myles pleasemyles udland its  you could just yeah i mean i dont know i think that sozzi i think the reason that people like it is because yeah ok so lets you read the bitcoin white paper right thats like nine or  pages so and that doesnt really take a whole it takes a half hour maybe  minutes to get through that thing thats most of the fundamental work underlying a lot of whats happening in the space and i know that people are not going to like hearing thatbut the reason that people are attracted to crypto and why its fun soz is you actually can go read one thing on one site and say sure ill take my chances and like if you do that for a stock you are clearly ignoring thousands of pages worth of fundamental data on a public company or a public debt or something like that that you should be familiarizing yourself with when it comes to crypto you can absolutely justify saying hey ill take a flyer and i think thats why people think its fun i think thats what has attracted a lot of people to the space i dont really see that changingjulie hyman yeah as long as youre not pouring your life savings into the thing now on the plus sidemyles udland and everyone says dont do that sojulie hyman right exactly i think thats a hopefully a consensus
