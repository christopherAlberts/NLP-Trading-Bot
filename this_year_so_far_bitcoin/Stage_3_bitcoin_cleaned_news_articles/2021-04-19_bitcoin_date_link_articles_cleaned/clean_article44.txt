recovering its losses what’s nextcointelegraph presents five factors to consider as a new trading week gets underway and cryptocurrency holders across the board nurse their woundsstocks primed for “up only” short termthe macro picture is fairly stable in asia and europe with the united states markets yet to opena mixed picture greeted investors at the open but volatility has been broadly absent with only oil showing signs of more pronounced weaknessas such little impact on bitcoin is to be expected from equities moves — these forecasts to continue building on record highs in the coming weeksrussel chesler head of investments and capital markets at the australian branch of cryptofriendly investment manager vaneck captured the mood in a note quoted by bloomberg“our current view is that with shortterm interest rates set to remain low for the medium term and our expectation that earnings will continue to increase it is unlikely that the increase in longterm interest rates will trigger an equity market fall” he wrotecoronavirus concerns still linger despite stocks’ relentless surge higher with more reported official cases last week than ever before worldwideeconomic responses continue to vary with a patchwork of openings and closings characterizing countries’ latest attempts to control the outbreakbitcoin recovers from crash to in bitcoin circles the main talking point naturally remains the weekend’s events which saw a sudden cascade of selling which sent btcusd down by  in a matter of minutesbouncing at just above  the crash echoed several similar events this year and bitcoin managed to regain around  of its lost ground within hoursbtcusd  candle chart bitstamp source tradingviewresponses however are split between those who consider the volatility “business as usual” and more conservative voices calling time on the latest bull runas cointelegraph reported suspicions are focusing on a chinese power blackout that hit the hash rate as well as rumored legal action by united states regulators against unnamed financial institutions related to money launderingin his own breakdown of what happened popular statistician willy woo highlighted both china and skittish moves by futures investors as contributing to the losses“we just saw the single largest  drop in mining hash rate since nov  the hash rate on the network essentially halved causing mayhem in btc price as it crashed” he told twitter followersin a sign that the future could see fresh sustained upside woo reiterated the “reset” in an onchain metric the spent transaction output ratio sopr showing that longterm investors will likely soon stop selling altogether“the onchain sopr metric near a full reset a classic buy the dip signal” he added“in simple terms profit taking by longer term investors is completing very little sell power left unless investors want to sell at a loss from their entry price unlikely in a bull market”fundamentals point higherit’s not just sopr — a whole range of bitcoin network indicators and fundamentals are buoying bulls’ cause even as btcusd remains below even february’s high of for woo and others particularly important are the transfer of funds to investors who have traditionally hodled not sold — another classic trait of bitcoin’s rise in recent monthsbitcoin liquid supply change chart showing transfers to strong hands source willy wootwitter“serious stronghanded holders are buying this dip in the last  hours over  bitcoin became illiquid a  record” fellow analyst william clemente added sunday“this illiquid supply increase is not only just dip buyers with no history of selling but partially accumulation from  months ago of which those wallets have just crossed the ‘illiquid’ threshold for this metric”lastly around  of the total available bitcoin supply has been active above  something which woo says is confirming its status as a trilliondollar asset at around  bitcoin’s market cap becomes a solid  trillion“this dip happened while unprecedented numbers of new users are arriving onto the network per day there’s been a retail influx in the last  weeks” woo additionally noted with total wallet numbers nearing  milliondifficulty takes care of miner woesa closer look at the hash rate which at one point dipped by almost half shows that a recovery in line with price is underwayaccording to rough estimates from onchain monitoring resource blockchain the bitcoin network hash rate is already back above  exahashes per second having broken through the  ehs barrier for the first time in history last weekbitcoin hash rate chart source blockchainminers leaving the network due to power problems leads to bitcoin’s network difficulty decreasing to incentivize more to come onlinefurther confirmation that the weekend’s issue was firmly temporary comes from difficulty forecasts — in two weeks’ time when it next adjusts the difficulty will only drop by around  a modest move that could yet be canceled out altogether as miners returnthis balance between the hash rate and difficulty is arguably the most important aspect of bitcoin one that allows it to govern itself and preserve security and functionality regardless of sudden events impacting network participantschinese central bank praises bitcoin and stablecoinsin another unanticipated event that is arguably yet to be fully appreciated by the market china has given an unprecedented stamp of approval to cryptocurrency as an “investment alternative”speaking at a conference organized by cnbc li bo deputy governor of the people’s bank of china broke ranks to validate both bitcoin and stablecoins“we regard bitcoin and stablecoin as crypto assets these are investment alternatives” he saidthe comments are surprising as despite being a center for bitcoin mining activity china has had a blanket ban in place on trading and transacting in cryptocurrencies since september “every country that bans bitcoin eventually reverses that ban you simply cannot be competitive in the  century economy without it” charles edwards founder of investment firm capriole responded“china is playing  chess the last  days have made very clear they still dominate global mining slowly slowly then all at once”the market barely reacted to this highlevel affirmation of bitcoin’s longterm potential at the time of writing bitcoin is still hovering at  as yet failing to see an attack of familiar resistance levels
