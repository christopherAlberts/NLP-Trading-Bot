a typicalbitcoin mining farm in china credit investopediabitcoin and the nearly  other cryptocurrencies it has spawned promise to revolutionize finance but it’s doing so leaving a dirty footprint mining bitcoin consumes as much electricity as entire countries like argentina or ukrainealthough the recent surge in bitcoin price has driven even more mining operations across the world mining tends to be concentrated in certain regions — regions where energy tends to be cheapby far the largest bitcoin mining hub is china’s inner mongolia which is responsible for  of all the planet’s bitcoin mining for comparison the entire united states is responsible for just  of global bitcoin mining however this is set to change after the chinese government ordered inner mongolia to shut down all cryptocurrency mining operations and ban new crypto operations in a bid to crack down on fossil fuelintensive energy consumptionadvertisementmining bitcoin is extremely energyintensive due to the way the network was set up which involves complex algorithms that demand a lot of computing power to solve each time a transaction is verified or a new block is added to the blockchain this is what bitcoin mining actually doesit’s no coincidence that inner mongolia has grown into the world’s most important crypto mining hub the chinese region which stretches from the tibetan plateau’s northeast ramparts along the great bend of the yellow river toward china’s far northeast is also a huge industrial stronghold and a major hub for physical mining of coal and rareearth minerals the concentration of coal mines and coalfired powered plants has made inner mongolia’s electricity dirt cheapup until not too long ago crypto miners paid inner mongolia’s electric power trading center only  cents per kwh that’s more than five times cheaper than the  cents per kwh that the average residential customer in the united states pays for electricityadvertisementwith electricity so cheap inner mongolia rapidly drew bitcoin miners who found their operations increasingly profitable as the price of the crypto asset surgedbut china’s government has apparently had enough after reviewing the region’s energy consumption and energy intensity beijing found that inner mongolia failed to meet the  targets it set out it was the only one out of china’s  mainland regions that had failed to meet beijing targets which drew a lot of criticism from the central governmentto save face and redeem itself the local authorities of inner mongolia have planed a number of drastic rules in an effort to curb energy consumption according to a draft rule issued by the region’s state planner energy consumption growth will be capped at around  million tonnes of standard coal equivalent for part of the new orders means plants and factories that use outdated and inefficient technologies to produce steel ferroalloy coke graphite electrode and coalpowered electricity must close by the end of the energy control measures also target bitcoin mining all existing cryptocurrency mining projects have until april  before they must shut down the approval of any new mining projects has been bannedget more science news like this join the zme newsletter for amazing science news features and exclusive scoops more than  subscribers cant be wrong daily weekly i have read and agree to the terms  conditions leave this field empty if youre humaninner mongolia has also vowed to increase its share of renewable energy by installing more than  gigawatts of renewable generation capacity by but china isn’t cracking down on cryptos solely out of environmental concerns the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies is completely incompatible with china’s governance that requires a tight grip over virtually every aspect of its citizens’ livesit’s really no surprise that a communist country like china hates bitcoin previously china banned initial coin offerings and shut down many businesses involved in crypto operations including exchanges and sites like yuanpay group more recently china has taken a more complex approach with american billionaire entrepreneur and venture capitalist peter thiel claiming that china even uses bitcoin as a ‘financial weapon’
