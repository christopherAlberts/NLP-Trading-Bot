in gg oil company of indiana inc v continental western insurance co  the indiana supreme court considered the emerging area of computer crime coveragegg oil was insured under a multiperil commercial common insurance policy by continental that provided commercial crime coverage specifically the policy provided the following coverage provisionwe will pay for loss or damage to “money” “securities” and “other property” resulting directly from the use of any computer to fraudulently cause a transfer of that property from inside the “premises” or “banking premises” to a person other than a “messenger” outside those “premises” or to a place outside those “premises”on november   gg oil discovered it was locked out of its computer systems due to ransomware and the company’s operations were halted as a result to regain access to its computer systems gg oil believed it would have to contact the person or entity responsible for the attack after consulting with the fbi and certain computer tech services gg oil transferred payment in the form of bitcoin valued at nearly  to the hackers believed to be responsible and regained access to its computer systemsgg oil submitted an insurance claim to continental which denied coverage under the policy concluding that computer hacking was “specifically excluded” from the policy when gg oil declined computer hacking and computer virus coverage in the “agribusiness property and income coverages” section of the policy moreover the claim was denied as continental believed the payment of bitcoin was voluntarily transferred by gg oil as a result gg oil filed suit against continentalthe trial court granted continental’s motion for summary judgment after first finding that gg oil’s loss was not “fraudulently caused” but was instead the result of theft second the trial court determined that gg oil’s payment to the hacker was a “voluntary payment to accomplish a necessary result” after finding that the payment of bitcoin was an intervening cause that severed the causal chain of events that would constitute a loss “resulting directly from the use of a computer” in a unanimous opinion the court of appeals affirmed the trial court’s decision determining that “the hijacker did not use a computer to fraudulently cause gg to purchase bitcoin to pay as ransom” and “he hijacker did not pervert the truth or engage in deception in order to induce gg to purchase the bitcoin”in reviewing the matter the indiana supreme court interpreted the phrase “fraudulently cause a transfer” and determined it to be unambiguous in doing so the court analyzed multiple sources including dictionary definitions and recent federal cases the court stated that computer fraud coverage and computer hacking is “an emerging area of the law” and that the term “fraudulently cause a transfer” can be reasonably understood simply as “to obtain by trick” but not every ransomware attack is necessarily fraudulent the court used the example that “if no safeguards were put in place it is possible a hacker could enter a company’s servers unhindered and hold them hostage there would be no trick there” based on this principle the court determined that gg oil was not entitled to summary judgment based on its mere belief that its computer systems were obtained by trick as such belief was not enough to eliminate any other reasonable inference conversely the court determined that the trial court had too narrowly defined the phrase “fraudulently cause a transfer” as there was not enough known on the record to conclude that gg oil’s computer systems were not obtained by trickthe court also determined that the trial court improperly found that gg oil’s payment of bitcoin constituted an intervening cause that severed the causal chain of events to deem the payment voluntary rather than “resulting directly from the use of a computer” as provided under the policy the court’s determination was based on the fact that gg oil’s bitcoin payment was at least made under duress given that the company’s operations were shut down at the time of the transfer
