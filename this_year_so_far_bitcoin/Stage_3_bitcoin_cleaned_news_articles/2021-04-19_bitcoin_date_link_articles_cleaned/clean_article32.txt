defi stands for decentralised finance it’s the central concept underlying bitcoin and other cryptocurrenciesit represents a dramatic shift from the way we’ve always handled moneytraditional financial systems rely on payment processors banks and ultimately the government to administrate and regulate all financial transactions defi takes power from institutions and instead relies on blockchain technologyblockchain technology provides the technical workings for cryptocurrencies instead of relying on a central authority like a bank to administer and record transactions blockchain technology uses a public ledgerthe public ledger is a system in which transactions are verified not by a central authority but by the participants of the blockchain nobody has central power over transactions or balancesbitcoin is the beginning – but by no means the endbitcoin is without a doubt the most notable example of defi crypto todayit was the first player in the market and is continuing today stronger than ever for many people bitcoin is more of an investment product than an actual currencythe staggering rises and falls in bitcoin’s value have given many investors massive profits while bitcoin is unrivaled today there are many competing coins offering new innovationsthe most prominent competitor is ethereum a cryptocurrency that has inspired many offshoots and alternative uses of its blockchain technologyas ethereum continues development many believe that it could supplant bitcoin with its more advanced featuresdecentralised applications make heavy use of the ethereum network and congestion at certain times can cause increased fees ethereum is currently moving towards solutions to these problems that could cement it as the dominant defi cryptocurrencywhat problems does defi cryptocurrency solve todaythe reason that decentralised finance is advancing at such a rapid rate is simple it provides practical solutions to real problemscentralised control by financial institutions is one of those problems with a traditional centralised institution somebody has control over transactions and balanceswhen you put your money in the bank the bank has your money ideally they will act honestly and in your best interest all of the time in practice this isn’t always the casewith centralised control of currencies also comes government controlthe government of a country can print more money at any time this leads to inflation devaluing current fundsin some cases governments devaluing their currency can cause hyperinflation this is disastrous wiping out savings and catalyzing numerous other social problemswith defi crypto the government cannot simply decide to increase the money supplycentralised finance also gives both institutions and governments the ability to impose restrictions on citizens at willthe government or your bank can freeze or even remove your assets these methods are supposed to be for stopping criminals seeing wide use against terrorist organizationshowever some countries use these tools politically defunding activists and protestorsthere is also a reliance on official payment channels with centralized finance even if the bank has not frozen your funds payment processors reserve the right to deny services to people or ventures they do not supportpeople can find themselves without any way to conduct business at the whim of the companies controlling payments without any means of recoursesome companies such as the immediate edge software take advantage of these new payment systems and try to lure innocent victims into investingdefi crypto solves all of these problems by removing centralised authority from the equationusing bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies there is no method to freeze or seize funds transactions are carried out through the blockchain so there is no way to refuse payments to or from a certain personwhere is defi crypto headed in the futuredefi crypto certainly seems to be the future of financeremoving the limitations of centralised finance like offering services  with no restrictions already gives it a significant advantagebut the main reason to be hopeful for the future is the continued innovation in decentralised financethere are ongoing projects across many areas that could provide more services through defi in the futuremany efforts are going into providing accessible platforms to make blockchain technology more accessible to developersthere are also numerous projects trying to bring more complex financial services to decentralized financein the future defi could provide loans and integrate interest rates within cryptocurrency frameworks more than simply allowing more convenient transactions decentralised finance could someday provide any and all financial services
