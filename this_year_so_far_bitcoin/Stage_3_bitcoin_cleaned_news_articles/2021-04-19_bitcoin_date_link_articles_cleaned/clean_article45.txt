bangalore less  moreif we are to understand crypto currency it is crucial to first appreciate the role of block chain technology bct if crypto currency is an automobile bct is the engine thus crypto currency cannot exist without bct while bct can exist independently as a technology due to it’s various applications in ecommerce fund transfers voting health care marketing and all activities where accountability transparency accuracy in tracking transaction costs matter in productivity of service through quality controlblock chain technologycommencing from a person who requests a transaction is stored in a block and the transaction is broadcast to a peer to peer network aided by computers or nodes which validate the transaction and user’s status using known algorithms in the block the verified transaction for instance can be contracts records crypto currency and other documents upon verification the transaction is combined with other transactions creating a new block of data called a ledger this new block is added to the existing block chain completing the transaction block chain is a digitized distributed and secure ledger that guarantees immutable transactions and solves the trust problem when two parties exchange value for instance sahyadri farms a farmer producer company in nasik maharashtra is using bct in exporting quality grapes and has emerged as india’s largest grape exporter exporting  of grapes in agriculture one of the benefits of bct is accurate traceability of produce such as the farm from where a produce was cultivated the soil properties quality of inputs used nature of agrochemicals used from production to marketing especially consumers who pay substantially higher for organic produce can track the farm farmer and quality through bctcrypto currencycrypto currency is a digital or virtual currency bitcoin for instance is one of the several crypto currencies and is not a coin in the conventional sense bitcoin is the world’s biggest crypto currency with a price of  per coin followed by ethereum  bitcoin cash  litecoin  and so on the value of bitcoin fell by  on  th april  therefore it is crucial to note the extent of fall which can be so steep can the market forces responsible be traced  can there be a possible consideration of devaluation as a monetary policy to promote exports  let us not forget how india benefited from  economic liberalization but these are obsolete with crypto currenciesif crypto currency is so transparent why bitcoin founders have not beensatoshi nakamoto is the pseudonymous person or a group of persons who developed bitcoin devising the first block chain data base solving the doublespending issues using peer to peer network it appears several persons claiming to be nakamoto the question which arises here is if crypto currency is so transparent and accountable why the developers of bitcoin have maintained secrecy and therefore gives raise to apprehensions regarding the future of crypto currencies irrespective of their potential benefitscrypto currencies secure from counterfeitcrypto currencies are secured from counterfeiting avoiding double accounting and do not require monitoring and control by any central bank while there are advantages of this benefit there can be potential disadvantages since the trust of citizens lies with the central bank – the reserve bank of india the benefit of avoidance of counterfeit notes is enormous for india where neighboring countries are often found to have reported in counterfeit involvement as also disturbing peace and tranquility in border areas similarly the benefit of double accounting ie a currency once transacted for a purpose is recorded and cannot be transacted again since each transaction is recorded in the public ledger in the block chain since each digital or virtual currency is numbered and unique it is possible to locate each transaction made by persons institutions and there can be no double transaction this avoids corruption  rentseeking behaviorcan any country sacrifice it’s currency a national identity to accommodate crypto currency even with all the benefits appreciable the crucial question is can any country sacrifice it’s own currency and accommodate a crypto currency like for example bitcoin indian rupee for india us  for the us japanese yen for the japan for instance serve as the nation’s identity can any country sacrifice it’s nation’s identitysupreme court ruling on crypto currencycan any country permit more than one currency in transactions it is crucial to ponder regarding permission of operation of two or more currencies in any country and the confusion it can create among the general public in the absence of monitoring by a central bank crypto currencies can be conduit for black money or money for funding illegal activities such as terrorism the rbi in a circular issued in april  banned financial institutions providing services in exchange trading of crypto currencies this was challenged in the supreme court which ruled that crypto currency is capable of being accepted as valid payment for purchase of goods and services and payment systems can be regulated by the rbi thus rbi by law can protect the monetary system from threat to financial systemprivate crypto currencies like bitcoin will be bannedthe government will shortly introduce crypto currency and regulation of official digital currency bill  in parliament to ban private crypto currencies such as bitcoin as it interferes with the central banking system enabling private parties to toy with currencies
