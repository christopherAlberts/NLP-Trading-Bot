the btcusd completed the wave  orange as mentioned last time we considered the next push up as a wave  orangethis wave  did not move up that far and high but it is quite normal for the uptrend to lose some momentum in a wave  purple line in the ao there was a small rising wedge pattern that probably supported the slow move up the wave  orange of wave  grey probably completed a larger wave  pink the wave  is showing overall a lot of momentum strong ao bars the bearish correction even though price dropped a lot during the weekend does not change the overall uptrend because price action is respecting the shallow  and  fibonacci retracement levels blue boxes the bounce at the fibs is typical for a wave  pink another correction could take place via an abc grey pattern the first breakout above the  ema zone is therefore risky because price could make a higher low first but a  breakout above the  ema zone and the  resistance zone followed by the top at  should create another strong push up later in april may or june the next targets are located at the round levels of   and even  a break below the support at  would certainly place the uptrend on hold and perhaps even indicate an early endon the  hour chart we can see the bearish correction took price action from the top of the channel back down to the bottom of the channel and the longterm moving averages
