mayoral contender andrew yang wants new york city to capitalize on the bitcoin boomthe cryptocurrency has seen a  increase over the past year setting a record valuation near  in march tesla’s  billion dollar investment helped spur the rise at the beginning of  yang tweeted on february  “as mayor of nyc  the world’s financial capital  i would invest in making the city a hub for btc and other cryptocurrencies”the former presidential candidate has also tweeted about climate change calling the issue “a matter of life and death” hence why new yorkers were quick to point out the energy consumption controversy that has some environmental experts concerned about future fallout from the cryptocurrency’s meteoric risebitcoin has the potential to create significant challenges for curbing the world’s emissions a study from  published in nature showed that bitcoin’s energy use alone could push global warming above  degrees celsius within three decades if it follows the adoption rate seen with other popular technologies camilo mora a statistics professor at the university of hawaii and one of the study’s coauthors said when they ran the calculations of bitcoin’s energy consumption he thought something was wrong with his eyesight“i recall counting the zeros to see if i was seeing blurry” said moragothamistwnyc contacted andrew yang’s campaign for comment but received no replyeven now bitcoin uses almost the same amount of energy as all the data centers in the world that power megascale operations such as big tech the internet cloud computing services and the financial sector said alex de vries financial economist and the founder of digiconomist a blog about digital trends“its pretty hard to wrap your head around” de vries said “because when im talking about all data centers in the world i literally mean all data centers in the world”bitcoin consumes more electricity than the country of argentina how exactly can this align with your climate change plan when energy efficiency is key to slashing our greenhouse gas emissions — tasfia tnclimate february  bitcoin is an environmental catastrophe encouraging it is denial of the climate crisis and suicidal for a city at sea level  — alec perkins alecperkins february  if bitcoin were a country it would rank  in terms of energy consumption ahead of countries like sweden the ukraine and argentina according to data from the university of cambridge bitcoin electricity consumption index as of april  bitcoin is on pace to consume about as much electricity this year as all the homes in the midatlantic statesin effect a single bitcoin transaction could actually power nearly  us households for a full day” said tara shirvani a digitalization and infrastructure specialist at the european bank for reconstruction and development “at its peak bitcoin was consuming the same amount of energy per year as nearly  million us homes”mining powerhow can a cryptocurrency that exists solely in a virtual space create this problemmining for bitcoin carries most of the blame cryptocurrency can’t be pulled out of the ground like coal gold or other physical resources instead new bitcoin is minted by having computers solve complex mathematical equations before more currency is added to the marketplace miners must prove they’ve invested resources into the processthe bitcoin process is designed to become more complicated as the marketplace grows creating a greater demand for the computational power needed to earn bitcoin and verify transactions on the network this setup has resulted in people building warehouses filled with computers—mainly in china where energy is cheap—to mine for bitcoinkeeping all those computers running and cooled requires a tremendous amount of electricityproponents argue that renewables support a large portion of bitcoin and they’re right— of the energy used by cryptocurrencies including bitcoin comes from green sources an impressive number for any industrybitcoin mining alone uses more energy than the entire country of chile and we are in a climate crisis but go off i  pictwittercompdifcvfjig — nycdsa ecosocialist working group 🌹 nycdsaecosoc february  but in places where there’s a limited amount of cheap renewables bitcoin miners can drain local economies which then must bring in more expensive nonrenewable energy from elsewhere to make up the difference said david gerard author of attack of the  blockchain “people in small towns suddenly get a two hundred dollar electricity bill instead of  and they get a bit upset” said gerardin  plattsburg in upstate new york put a moratorium on new cryptomining operations because an influx of bitcoin prospectors siphoned up the city’s lowcost hydroelectric power “bitcoin advocates never talk about displacement because it makes the numbers sound bad” said gerardand that’s in places where renewables are cheaper than fossil fuels which is not the widespread norm especially in countries like china where coal is cheap shirvani said that bitcoiners switching to green energy would remain untenable on a large scalearrow in february tesla and ceo elon musk purchased  billion in bitcoin the electric car company now accepts the cryptocurrency as a form of payment britta pedersenapshutterstock“the dominance of chinese miners and lack of motivation to swap cheap fossil fuels for more expensive intermittent renewables means there are few quick fixes to the emissions problem” said shirvanianother favorite argument for bitcoin is that its mining can use otherwise wasted energy from natural gas flares but de vries said this solution isn’t climatefriendly because it motivates more investment in greenhouse gas production“now were going to make a byproduct of fossil fuel extraction more profitable who is that going to help its going to help the fossil fuel companies and it doesnt stop emissions” said de vriessocial value of bitcoinnic carter a partner at castle island ventures a public blockchainfocused venture fund said the debate about bitcoin’s electricity use is not about energy but about the societal merits “a lot of people frankly dislike bitcoin for a number of reasons and energy is the most effective way to critique it” carter saiddr garrick hileman head of research at blockchaincom and visiting fellow at the london school of economics said he thinks bitcoin is being targeted rather than other industries such as the traditional financial system because its energy data is transparent “other uses that could be similarly debated do not have energy consumption data as readily available for scrutiny”compared to manufacturing or transportation bitcoin is negligible in its energy consumption anywhere between  to  of global energy depending on who you ask according to the cambridge bitcoin electricity consumption index electricity used by pluggedin but passive home devices in the us alone could power bitcoin mining for  years but when only two countries in the world—morocco and the gambia—are meeting their paris accord targets every bit counts on the march toward netzero emissionsarrow the datacenter

isn’t the only environmental cost of bitcoin mining as the devices involved in the process cannot be reused this creates a significant amount of electronics waste once they become obsolete only  of electronic waste is recycled worldwidesome alternatives to cryptomining don’t require as much energy ethereum another popular cryptocurrency is working on replacing the mining algorithm with a greener alternative “i dont see that at all in bitcoin they’re just much more conservative” said de vriesbitcoin may also lose sway in the future reducing its energy demands what we do know is that there are a finite number of bitcoins and the last one will be mined in  “which is way too late to do something about climate change” said de vries
