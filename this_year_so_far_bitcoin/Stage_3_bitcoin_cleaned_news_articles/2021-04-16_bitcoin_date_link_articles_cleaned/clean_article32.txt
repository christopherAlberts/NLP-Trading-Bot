the asymmetric upside of bitcoin is tangential to bonds’ asymmetric downside as traditional treasury assets collapsemimesis capital inside the event horizon report bitcoin versus bonds asymmetric assetsjack bogle the founder of vanguard popularized the idea of a “ portfolio” the  portfolio is the basic idea that passive investors looking to efficiently transfer wealth through time should diversify their assets into  stocks and  bondsif bitcoin’s performance over the last decade tells you anything it should scream that the  portfolio is deadyale’s endowment fund is a prime example of forwardthinking asset allocation as of  the endowment held only  of their portfolio in bonds and they also began stacking bitcoinwhat is the catalyst for this shift by “smart” moneywhy shift out of bonds into bitcoinfirst bitcoin is the world’s hardest monetary good it is the only asset with no counterparty risk and no dilution risk and is therefore “the world’s safest asset”these two unique characteristics will eventually enable bitcoin to store a nearinfinite amount of wealth this means that the upside of allocating capital savings into bitcoin is orders of magnitude higher than its current market priceadditionally the maximum potential downside of using bitcoin is  meaning that it is only possible to lose what you put inasymmetrythese unequal potential outcomes create a unique dynamic called asymmetrythe potential asymmetric return of bitcoin becomes even more interesting because it is nearly inevitable in the long run and total loss is nearly impossiblein contrast traditional fiatdenominated debt held by investors as bonds and bank deposits has a similar asymmetric return but to the downsideunlike the case with bitcoin the potential return of a  us treasury note is only  annually if you hold the  note to maturity a total of  years you cannot earn more than that predetermined return denominated in usd at best this would somewhat “retain” your purchasing power more than holding cash under your mattressnominally the potential downside of storing wealth in bonds isn’t that bad depending on to whom you lent the money in real terms holding bonds could be catastrophic ou could be risking  of your real capital for a measly maximum  nominal returnbitcoin is antifragile and bonds are fragilenassm taleb popularized the idea that the opposite of fragile is not robust but antifragile fragile systems break under stress robust systems tend to remain fortified under stress and antifragile systems become stronger under stressbitcoin can be viewed as the most antifragile asset in the modern financial system whereas bonds may be viewed as the most fragile asset in the financial systema fantastic example of this dichotomy is asset performance postcovid the global pandemic was a massive shock to the world that unleashed massive volatility disrupted cash flows and business insolvencyin the short term in march  bitcoin appeared to be fragile and treasury bonds appeared to be antifragile however massive unprecedented economic shifts took time to play out once all rational economic actors responded the pandemic and financial shock were inevitably met by massive amounts of fiscal spending and quantitative easing by governments and central banks worldwidesince before covid began longterm treasury bonds tlts are down by  whereas bitcoin is up by more than although tlts have dropped by  nominally the situation is much worse in real terms for example tlts are down by  denominated in bitcoin global bond marketas of august  the total size of the global bond market was approximately  trillion which is more than ✕ the size of bitcoin at  trillionthis massive size difference comes at the end of a  bull market in bonds meaning that rates have hit alltime lows and have nowhere to go except remain at extremely low levels or slowly creep upwardfor deeper insights on global debt cycles i recommend “how the economic machine works” by ray dalio and “the conclusion of the longterm debt cycle and the rise of bitcoin” by dylan leclairbitcoin and macro backdropin a world of extremely low bond yields and massive inflation driven by government and central bank fiscal and monetary policy there is only one asset worth holding in size bitcoinbitcoin’s relative lack of adoption combined with its perfectly increasing scarcity made it the bestperforming asset of the last decade and it will likely be the bestperforming asset of the next decade as welltldr drop everything and stack bitcoin and if you don’t do that at least drop bonds for itthis is a guest post by mimesis capital opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of btc inc or bitcoin magazine
