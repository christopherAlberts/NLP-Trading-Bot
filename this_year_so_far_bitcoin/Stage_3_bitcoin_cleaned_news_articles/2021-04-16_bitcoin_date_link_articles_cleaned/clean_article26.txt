gm nick caserio at his prenfl draft presser on deshaunrelated qb plans “if you want to speculate you should probably go buy bitcoin”maybe gm nick caserio is flexing his atthepodium muscle with a powerful answer or maybe hes demonstrating a clever sense of humor or maybe like most of the rest of the people who care about the houston texans the new boss is quite exhausted by every single angle of the deshaun watson turmoil and is therefore in the mood to snap an answer on that particular subject“if you want to speculate caserio said at his friday prenfl draft press conference with the houston media you should probably go buy bitcoin”thats powerful clever and snappy and while we know very little a about cryptocurrency we do understand why caserio also added that the texans organization is respectful of the process regarding the beleaguered watsonthat respect is about the flood of suits having been filed against the star player charging him with sexual assault there is a legal process a police investigation and an nfl investigation that could result in watson being removed from the fieldthat respect is not presently about watsons trade desires a concept that was in play a month ago but is not removed from play due to his inlimbo statusthere is speculation that it makes no sense for the texans to keep the embattled quarterback caserio is correct to shut that down as we do not yet know thatthere is speculation that is makes no sense for any team to trade for him again we know teams like the philadelphia eagles continue to monitor the situation so that speculation is offbase as well and caserio is again correctread more nfl source philadelphia eagles remain interested in trade for watsonread more deshaun watson trade value for texans has crateredthere is speculation not only about a suspension but even about an arrest and yet again the texans gm is wise to avoid committing to anything there beyond acknowledging that vet qb tyrod taylor is in the fold  and beyond acknowledging the possibility that more changes in the qb room are to comewe dont know about buying bitcoin but we are buying what caserio is selling here which is avoidance of a verbal misstep that could worsen the situation so some power some humor and some snap all seem appropriateread more houston texans signing living legend passrusher
