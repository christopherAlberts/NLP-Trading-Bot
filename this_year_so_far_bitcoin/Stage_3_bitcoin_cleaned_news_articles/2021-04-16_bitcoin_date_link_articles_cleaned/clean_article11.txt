cryptocurrencylooking forward to meeting you at ifx expo dubai may  – making it happenbtc price rallyfinance magnates asked maria stankevich chief business development officer at exmo uk about her views on the recent btc price rally and the possibility of bitcoin hitting  this year “i believe that the btc will continue with the bullish trend there are many factors for that but i would name paypal and visa news as the most important ones needless to say this should force adoption for these crypto assets beyond speculation and support from institutions like paypal and visa is making it easier to use crypto that pushes btc price to a new ath the possibility of reaching usd  is very high in  firstly the dynamics of bitcoin at the moment almost ideally corresponds to the dynamics of an asset with a scarce value and according to the popular stocktoflow valuation model the goal of  is possible already this year the next factor is a high demand from institutional players and big market influencers such as paypal visa tesla etc and of course  usd is a symbolic psychological mark after  usd which many investors are guided by” she saidblockchain and crypto specialistswhen asked about the lack of blockchain and crypto specialists in regulatory departments of different governments around the world stankevich said “i believe that all today’s problems and crypto bans have their roots in lack of knowledge every day i read some news where bitcoin is blamed for money laundering or anonymity while we all know that this is the most transparent system ever if we apply all the aml and kyc procedures politicians make statements not even knowing that there are such compliance tracking systems in place that traditional institutions didn’t even dream about so it’s essential for governments to have people who not only understand the technology but also have a great experience in the market”role of supply and demand in bitcoin’s price surgejason deane bitcoin market analyst at quantum economics highlighted the significant role of supply and demand in the recent price rally of bitcoin “in the simplest terms possible the recent price changes are as always the result of the interaction between supply and demand since supply is absolute at least in terms of production the only variable in the equation is the demand side and this has changed radically in the last six months microstrategy’s surprise bitcoin purchase last august permanently changed the way that organizations fund managers and highlevel executives view the asset especially for the antiinflationary reasons cited in the accompanying press release and the concerns raised by the unprecedented levels of quantitative easing it was in our view a strong and public endorsement of the asset and marked both the beginning of the end of the experimental phase of bitcoin’s lifecycle and the beginning of the mass adoption phase both at an institutional and retail level” deane saidsuggested articles the global decentralized finance bunkergo to article  bitcoin levelwhile commenting on the  bitcoin price level deane said “for many bitcoiners however  will be ultimately seen as little more than an interesting milestone on the journey to far higher values this price is certainly achievable and will ultimately be driven by more of the same activity we’re seeing now even without development and adoption rates increasing beyond where they currently are in short there may well be enough development already ‘in the pipeline’ to enable this possibility within the current cycle”cryptocurrency hedge fundsmarc p bernegger founding board member of crypto finance ag highlighted the recent growth in crypto hedge funds “the crypto hedge industry is literally exploding right now and every week there are new managers joining the space so far quite a few active fund managers seem to be able to generate a substantial and sustainable alpha and it will be interesting to see how space will evolve there is still a lot of traditional money waiting on the sideline which hasn’t touched digital assets yet a fully regulated usbased etf is also insightful and will bring additional money into the asset class” bernegger saidcrypto fomo“bitcoin is in a powerful position right now it is crucial to zoom out and always look at the bigger picture – when you do you can see that on the balance of probabilities bitcoin should sustain this bullish momentum the market is likely only warming up we are at the base of where this cycle could take us critical drivers of  bitcoin would be fomo fear of missing out those who do not own bitcoin and other crypto assets will have the fear that they have ‘missed the boat’ and start investing as soon as they can concerning this the crypto asset market is still infant and around  of what it will be in the future adoption more of the likes of tesla and microstrategy purchasing bitcoin this is a domino effect the floodgates are starting to open etfs being approved for bitcoin in canada us should be next shortage of bitcoin on the exchanges which is driving up demand as there is lack of supply simple” johnny mccamley founder of cryptoclear told
