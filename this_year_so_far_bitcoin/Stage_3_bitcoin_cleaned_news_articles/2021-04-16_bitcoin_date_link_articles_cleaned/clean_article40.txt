cryptocurrency three years ago jimenez — then a youthful startup founder at the age of  — saw a chance for both beating hyperinflation and taking clandestine revenge on the countrys detested socialist governmentthe story of the life of now exiled cryptocurrency creator gabriel jimenez is one of big hopes and high treasonbefore the government of leftist leader nicolas maduro approached him about creating a digital coin jimenez was part of venezuelas antigovernment movement and took part in several street protests at the time the economy of the oilrich south american country was already in free fallpetro the worlds first statebacked cryptocurrencyjimenez saw an opportunity to change his country from within for him a digital currency like bitcoin was the epitome of freedom no central control complete transparency — actually the opposite of what the venezuelan government was looking for caracas wanted a way to circumvent us sanctions slapped by president donald trumpthe perilous ride transported jimenez from the life of an activist to the center of venezuelas dark institutions of power however the worlds first stateowned digital coin the petro he helped create didnt become the kind of revolution he had hoped forvenezuelan strongman maduro rigth hopes the petro can blunt the effects of us sanctions and a homemade economic crisisas the petro is backed by venezuelas oil reserves it breaks the tenets of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies whose values dont derive from a natural resource or government fiat money but only the laws of mathematics before and after petros launch in february  jimenez was also repeatedly forced to change the tokens socalled white paper stating on which blockchain platform the coin runsi was naive at the time and its still hurting me to see how the petro is being misused as a political weapon by the government he said adding that eventually he was forced to flee into exile to escape arrest and punishmentinflation and digital coin usage going through the roofjimenezs former dealings with the maduro government have made him a controversial figure whos lost much trust within the global cryptocommunity and yet he says hes still determined to fight his countrys spiraling inflation that forced the government just in march to issue a  million bolivar note — worth about half a us dollarlast year alone the annual inflation rate reached  causing venezuelans lifetime savings to go up in smoke and accelerating their flight to the us dollar according to venezuelan think tank ecoanalitica some  of all financial transactions in the country are already made in the us currency at the same time cryptocurrency trades paid for with venezuelan bolivar have been surging data from cryptotrading platform localbitcoins showsblockchain analysts from new yorkbased chainalysis also say cryptotraders from venezuela are among the most active in the world ranking close to those in the us and russia when it comes to peertopeer  dollarbased cryptotradingjose maldonado a journalist who writes for crypto news platform cointelegraph says its even possible to pay street vendors with digital coins in some bigger venezuelan cities like caracas maracaibo or valencia the trend was also spreading to traditional brickandmortar stores he told dw in an emailwhether its furniture clothing or groceries — virtually everything can be purchased with cryptocurrencies he said adding that venezuelans coins of choice are mainly bitcoin ether dash and eos cryptocurrency exchange binance he noted had meanwhile become as well known as the countrys biggest commercial bank banco de venezuelaplaything of the wellheeled expats and the governmentin venezuela its primarily the elites and members of the upper middle class who can afford to dabble in cryptocurrencies internet connections in many parts of the country are often too poor to allow access to coin trading for a majority of the population using digital currencies remains an illusion said maldonadostill cryptocurrencies are a financial lifeline for many venezuelans as they are an easy and affordable way for their relatives in exile to send money home widespread discontent with the countrys socialist rulers has forced  million venezuelans out of an overall population of  million to leave their countrythe venezuelan president is using the petro as a propaganda tool to boost public support for his social policypetro struggling for recognitionat the end of last year about  million public workers were paid half a petro each roughly  as a christmas bonus those who wanted to get it had to register on an internet platform of the government since this year tax payments can also be made using petrosthe governments drive to promote the usage of its digital token seems to be bearing fruit gas station operators reported in  that about  of all fuel payments were made with the petro there are however also reports that state officials are increasingly using the token to transfer their riches abroad because similarly to bitcoin digital coin trades are an ideal way to secretly stash away illgotten moneygabriel jimenez thinks working on the petro project was a mistake — one that pushes him to work harder to make up for it the only good thing that has come out of it he said was a wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies in venezuela although growing slowly among the population at large those who are using digital coins are gradually regaining ever bigger parts of their financial freedom and even if the risk of wild swings in their value is high he said cryptocurrencies are still a worthwhile investment given the seemingly neverending slide of venezuelas official currencythis article was adapted from germanparagraph  has been corrected to make it clear that jimenez never intended to give the venezuelan government a way to bypass us sanctions and was not aware of caracas real motive behind its cryptocurrency push
