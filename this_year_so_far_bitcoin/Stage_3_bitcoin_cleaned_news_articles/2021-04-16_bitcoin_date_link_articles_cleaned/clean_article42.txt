an objective story this week on my switzercomau website by my colleague paul rickard suggesting that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies need to be regulated underlined how angry people are on the internet and especially on twitter and facebookhere’s an example of the prickly response from one of our readers “nice hit piece paul full of emotional diatribe and short on facts here’s one example ‘the only real users of cryptocurrencies are criminals people who don’t want to pay tax or have their affairs subject to public scrutiny’“the veryclear implication is that people who don’t want their affairs subject to public scrutiny are criminals are you going to also start calling envelope users criminals too people who pull down their shades what about your personal finances publish your tax return paul or else you’re accusing yourself of being a criminal thats what crypto use case is all about financial privacy the free market is your friend paul snide sly comments do you no honour”this was an aggressive response to paul’s thinkpiece but there were more ugly ones i’ve decided not to publish that said what this reader has put forward is an interesting argument that does make me reply that privacy in a letter and in your home differs from privacy when a taxable transaction is hidden from viewof course there are techpeople using cryptocurrency and its great blockchain technology to more efficiently make payments but the lack of transparency and the greater difficulty to raise the right amount of tax has to be worrying governments along with paulcentral banks must also be concerned that one day they will have less control of financial systems because of the incomplete picture cryptocurrencies has created it’s a small problem now but as it grows greater and more effective regulation looks likelybut back to the angry keyboard warriors that don’t seem to be able to debate without insulting their rivalson one hand i worry that our intolerance of other people’s views will scare ‘outside the square’ thinkers to question modern currentlyacceptable practices but on the other hand i do like the potential for debate on hot topics and whether bitcoin is a bubble is one such topic tesla’s share price is too these are modern stories that should be debated without fears of overthetop reactions from those with another point of viewi’m interested in both of these two investment vehicles as one of the country’s best investors and smartest guys in the room magellan’s hamish douglas expressed concerns about these two tech stars of financial markets to me only this weeki interviewed hamish for our switzer virtual strategy days on april  and  and while he is invested in tech stocks such as microsoft his biggest holding he worries that speculative investments such as tesla and bitcoin have bubble characteristics akin to what he saw in the dotcom boom and bust of the late of course like paul hamish to kind of quote billy joel could be right he could be wrong or he could be crazy but we should be able to debate the subject and not fear personal attacks by nasty critics who simply don’t agreethere are those who’d love to bring the rough house tactics of the socalled cancel culture to debates on subjects such as excessively valued tech stocks shortselling and digital disruption but at this point in time the ‘you can’t say that’ mob are exclusively in the social issues arenathe poet william blake counselled the world when he told us “without contraries is no progression attraction and repulsion reason and energy love and hate are necessary to human existence” and the writer george bernard shaw was sure he got it right when he told us “nothing is ever accomplished by a reasonable man”george could be in trouble in the modern world with his use of the word “man” but if we ignore the bias of the  and early  centuries he lived his life in the point is well made that we need controversial people with minority points of view to instigate the processes that deliver progressin  in new south wales random breathtesting was introduced championed by labor mp george paciullo and it didn’t make him popular “before rbt drinking and driving was regarded as almost as natural as breathing the culture in every pub was ‘lets have one for the road’ you dont hear that anymore” said george to the smh in this now sensible idea wasn’t wellreceived by many aussies at the time as the following shows “the australian law reform commission recommended against rbt” the smh reported ‘important liberties should not surrendered on the basis of a hunch or as a consequence of wishful thinking’”meanwhile the australian newspaper editorialised that “rbt was a gross intrusion on human rights and freedoms as the law was based on the assumption that the driver might be drunk”and politicians had their say “queenslands premier sir joh bjelkepetersen a teetotaller thought the idea stank ‘it is not a votewinner it gets a lot of peoples backs up’ his colleague don lane went further ‘random breath tests are a fascist or nazistyle approach’”i guess this shows that nasty namecalling has always been a part of debates that involve encroachment on people’s rights but the ability to namecall and insult has escalated with the pilein nature of twitter and other social media platformsmy greatest fear is that the good thinkers and sensible thoughts will be buried because aggressive namecallers make it too difficult for some commentators to air their viewsi personally copped a huge gobfull from those who could not believe that house prices were going to rise over the past five or six years pessimists engaged in pathetic criticisms stooping to schoolyardlike insults such that i had to block them from my twitter accounti hated ‘cancelling’ a critic but if it was to be purely insults and not a wellargued counterargument i wasn’t interested in their crapcoronavirus aside happily most of my optimistic economic and market forecasts have been on the money none of these critics have ever conceded that i was right apart from john adams who actually conducted a great debate with chris joye on house prices in march that debate was on my old sky news business programme and attracted over  views reading the reactions today showed most thought john won the debate but there has been no house price collapse instead there has been a huge boomone day john will be right and only the coronavirus gave him the recession he predicted but even that was shortlived despite the biggest governmentcreated shutdown of economies ever and house prices continue to risethat debate also brought out a huge response from idiot insulters but it also brought out many thoughtful contributors via the internet to a really important topic that needed debatingit goes down as one of the best pieces of tv i’ve been involved in if it wasn’t for the internet  people would never have been able to have access to controversial and opposing points of viewthe pros of the internet and platforms like twitter outweigh the cons of simpleminded twisted losers who think it’s ok to insult rather than advance great and insightful points of viewwhether my critics are prepared to admit that i’ve been largely right on the economy stock prices and house prices apart from the fact i didn’t predict a pandemic and a worldwide government shutdown of businesses and economies there must be a reason for my success in getting it rightso what might it becould it be that i talk to lots of smart people with similar and different points of view and then i’m influenced to be optimistic or pessimistic on various economic and market matters as a consequence could it be that i’m not oneeyed and that could be my competitive advantagein his wonderful book the age of uncertainty the great economist john k galbraith got it so right when he said “in economics it is a far far wiser thing to be right than to be consistent”i find my critics are consistent but gee they get it wrong more times than not and in my very publiclyexposed game that would be a kiss of deathi think bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are here to stay but effective regulation to stop bad people using them for deceptive reasons will eventually come and its price will fall to less speculativelydriven levels that’s my best guess but i’m open to a changed point of view provided the possibly wiser observations come via intelligently wellconceived arguments free of pathetic insults
