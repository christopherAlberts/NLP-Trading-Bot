how to explain bitcoin as i said a couple of weeks ago it’s hard to dismiss the digital currency as a classic investment bubble because — unlike any of the other historical manias which have seen similarly extreme gains in price — it has formed a series of bubbles which have burst and then reinflated bubbles aren’t supposed to do this they are booms grown so large that they cannot gently deflate and must burst never to returnbitcoin has many of the symptoms of a speculative mania led by the sheer excitement it inspires in its believers but it’s hard to say what the digital asset’s value should be like gold value is in the eye of the beholder it has no intrinsic value and while the same is true of banknotes it has no government standing behind itplenty of people are grappling with the same issue and the value of bitcoin might best be derived from its absence to see how this works look at the odd relationship between gold and treasury bonds in this chart from gavekal research ltd generally treasuries beat gold when people aren’t too worried about inflation while gold wins when there are inflationary concerns except at present both are fallingthis is happening despite widespread belief in a new wave of reflationary growth and a historic amount of moneyprintinggold is generally thought of as an inflationary hedge but if we judge it instead in terms of silver we see that its price has roughly halved since the covid panic last year gold has grown steadily more expensive relative to silver since the bizarre year of  when prices of both precious metals went bonkers the last year has seen a spike and then a reversal for the ageswhat drives the gold price then dhaval joshi of bca research inc comes up with a different idea the following chart shows three centuries of the goldsilver ratio the relationship was stable until confidence in the gold standard eroded and then collapsed after the first world war during the decades of the soft gold standard of the postwar bretton woods agreement the ratio returned to its old level only to head back to the stratosphere once bretton woods broke down  years agojoshi contends that this shows demand for gold over silver is driven by its perception as a superior “antifiat” asset if people are worried about the longterm buying power of governmentissued currencies they will be prepared to pay more for gold with its perceived role as a store of value how then do we explain gold’s sudden fall in silver terms over the last yearthe joshi argument is that bitcoin has risen as an alternative antifiat asset it has been popular because of the libertarian antigovernment ideas that have accompanied the digital currency since its inception bitcoin’s increase in scale to become better known and much easier to obtain now makes it a much more viable competitor for the shiny metalthere is circumstantial evidence that some money has flowed directly from gold into bitcoin the following chart is from charles morris of bytetree asset management ltd and shows flows into investment funds holding both assets since last maynot all of the money leaving gold has gone into bitcoin but quite a big chunk has institutions appear to be making a decision to allocate some money to bitcoin as a hedge against a fiat collapse another important destination appears to be chinese bonds bitcoin’s strength in the last few months has come despite a distinct dropoff in google searches for the term which might be taken as a proxy for retail interest or the kind of excitement that typically accompanies a bubblebitcoin’s performance over the last year is directly aligned with movements in bond yields when yields rise so does bitcoin this implies that the digital currency benefits directly from the “reflation trade” — or the belief that inflation is coming and to be clear before anyone accuses me of chart crime this one has two scales bitcoin is prone to much more titanic moves than treasury bonds the point is that they both move in the same direction at the same timea rather more scientific analysis by the british research firm quant insight ltd shows bitcoin’s key sensitivity is to inflation breakevens the same is true of gold the difference at present is that bitcoin is positively correlated with breakevens gaining when fears about inflation rise while gold is negatively correlatedadding another layer morris of bytetree suggests that bitcoin is behaving like a growth stock and gold has never done thatbitcoin seems to have it all it is one of the few assets that seems to benefit from a rising bond yield – something we reserve for true growth stocks and those cyclicals enjoying recovery conversely this is normally detrimental to traditional lowgrowth safe assets such as gold defensive yield stocks and bonds unlike defensive stocks and bonds bitcoin and gold are both inflationsensitive but gold is happiest when the world faces a downward spiral in contrast bitcoin prefers a stronger economy when the yield is rising this is where we are todaythe current drive in bitcoin therefore looks like a bid to protect against currency debasement by means of a measured transfer from gold which is deemed the weaker antifiat asset for the moment bitcoin’s recent pause at a level where its price is still double what it was at the start the year overlaps with a pause in the bond market which had seemed to get ahead of itself real  yields have essentially moved sideways for more than a month since their big rise ended in late februaryif this is what is motivating people to buy bitcoin with resurgence in fears of debasement and inflation accounting for its persistent recovery after crashes the question of exactly how we should value it remains joshi looks at the merits of an antifiat asset as being tied up with its ability to avoid major losses gold can also have big drawdowns but nothing like the epic losses that bitcoin periodically inflicts on its holders before rallying again as bitcoin’s declines tend to be three times bigger risk can be equalized by holding three times as much gold as bitcoin — which implies buying more bitcoinis bitcoin really that direct a substitute for gold it’s a tough proposition to handle i am typing this with a very small piece of gold around my ring finger i am confident that i will never swap my wedding ring for one made of bitcoin gold at least has an intrinsic use as the raw material for muchdesired jewelry bitcoin has nothing so straightforward to fall back on official action might easily limit use of the digital asset if it grew big enough to challenge the government’s monopoly of currency issuanceone final issue is that as with gold there is so little to hold on to yes there are some measures that can justify a rising price bitcoin has been ingeniously designed so that the supply of new coin will reduce over time and so that price declines will reduce the incentive to spend money on increasing supply network effects can also make the currency more useful — the more applications are developed and the more easily and swiftly it can be used the more it becomes a viable currency but it still provides no yield to compare it to other assets and its continued susceptibility to massive crashes messes up its use as a means of exchange while ensuring that it continues to be an unreliable store of valuethe technology undergirding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continues to develop like the laser in its early days known as a “solution in search of a problem” cryptocurrencies and the blockchain could solve all kind of problems for us this is a reasonable hope if not something that can be pinned down and valued with discounted cash flow analysisfor now bitcoin fills a demand for a wider array of alternatives to fiat currencies at a time when many are deeply skeptical of monetary policy while also promising the kind of exciting growth that tech stocks have done it’s understandable that there would be wide demand for such an asset and while that demand is strong it is aided by that other universal force in markets fear of missing out if reflation doesn’t come through on cue however it might be as well to brace for another bitcoin bumpbloomberg
