the investment community has been taken on one heck of a ride over the past year the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic rocked equities over a fiveweek period which has since been followed by one of the most ferocious bounceback rallies on recordwhile tech stocks generally thrived amid the volatility one asset really stood headandshoulders above everything im talking about bitcoinbitcoins unstoppable ascent above since bottoming at close to  per token in march the worlds largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been virtually unstoppable last week bitcoin eclipsed the  mark and was at the time of this writing on jan  hovering slightly above a  billion market cap based on the circulating supply of tokenswhats powering bitcoin higher depends on who you ask and what social media platform you prefer to get your ideas from some folks would suggest that bitcoins scarcity is whats pushing it higher with a token limit of  million bitcoin avoids the deflationary aspect that has the potential to pulverize fiat currencies the us dollar for example has been pressured by a rapid increase in us money supply with the federal reserves ongoing quantitative easing measures and the federal governments fiscal stimulus the money supply should continue growingother folks point to bitcoins growing utility as reason for its increasing token value were seeing more bitcoin atms placed throughout the world and more than  businesses now accept bitcoin as payment globally according to data by fundera in the minds of crypto enthusiasts this demonstrates growing adoptionhowever theres a fatal flaw in the valuation thesis behind bitcoins meteoric ascent when it comes to scarcity and utility bitcoin can be perceived to have one but not both  and may not truly have eitherthe false perception of scarcityas noted bitcoins token limit is  million as transactions are verified on its underlying digital ledger blockchain and block rewards are paid to those handling this verification process new bitcoin tokens are minted there are close to  million bitcoin in circulation today and itll take almost  years to fully mine the remaining  million tokens pretty cutanddried case of scarcity rightnot so fasttheres a big difference between palpable scarcity and perceived scarcity take gold as the perfect example even though we may not know exactly how many ounces of gold there are on planet earth we can say without a doubt that no additional gold can be made in other words we cant use alchemy to create any more gold than whats been mined or whats yet to be mined thats what we call a hard cap and it represents a tangiblepalpable level of scarcity this is why gold has been referred to as a storeofvalue for so longon the other hand bitcoins scarcity is intangible and far from guaranteed the  million token cap was effectively plucked from thin air and community consensus has the potential to at any point in the future increase this token limit with tangibly scarce resources like gold theres no chance of increasing the lifetime supply with bitcoin that chance might be small but its unquestionably higher than  its this false perception of scarcity that keeps pushing bitcoin higherminimal utility at bestbitcoin bulls also push the utility narrative as noted an increasing number of businesses in the us and globally are now willing to accept bitcoin as a form of payment however any sort of broadbased adoption can be thrown out the window as long as bitcoin has its  million token cap in placefundera notes that over  us businesses allow bitcoin as a form of payment the problem is that there are  million businesses in the us with at least one employee and over  million if you count sole proprietors thats not exactly what id call broadbased adoptioneven more concerning is the concentration in holdings by investors the socalled hodlers back in december  bloomberg reported that  people owned approximately  of all circulating bitcoin in november  according to data from flipside crypto bloomberg notes that  of accountholders now control  of all bitcoin while perhaps some of these tokens are making their way into every day transactions this data would suggest that most tokens arent in circulation that leaves maybe  billion worth of bitcoin in circulation for payments which wont go very far toward creating a true medium of exchangewhat really drives bitcointhe point is this bitcoin bulls would have you believe its both scarce and growing in utilityadoption the reality is that bitcoins scarcity is questionable at best and it definitely for the time being lacks utility bitcoin enthusiasts can hope that the perception of scarcity continues but will have to come to terms with the fact that itll never be widely adopted or utilized by comparison if enthusiasts favor increased utility theyre going to have to accept the idea of community consensus increasing the token limit based on its existing setup bitcoin cannot have both scarcity and utilityso whats actually driving bitcoin higher blame inefficient markets emotions and technical analysisif supposed bitcoin whales are holding onto most of the circulating supply it suggests that program traders and smalltime speculators are behind most of the daytoday bitcoin movement the problem with such thin trading is that it can cascade to the downside just as quickly as weve seen bitcoin surge to the upsideearlier this month i called bitcoin  most dangerous investment i stand by that claim and firmly believe bitcoin will come crashing back to earth in a big way sooner than later
