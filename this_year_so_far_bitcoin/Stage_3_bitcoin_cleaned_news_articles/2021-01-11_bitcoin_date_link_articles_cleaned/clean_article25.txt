think back to  crypto was everywhere the celebrities hawking icos included dj khaled “floyd crypto mayweather” and longtime blockchain enthusiast paris hilton the most watched comedy on television “big bang theory” named an episode “the bitcoin entanglement” long island iced tea made the world’s most natural pivot rebranding itself as long blockchain corp the stock jumped and now crickets even though the price of bitcoin seems to break a new record every five minutes erupting from  to  in less than a year for some reason this bull run feels different – not as mainstream not as talked about not as paris hiltonyso is it really different there are many ways to measure a bull cycle the most obvious is by looking at the price another is to look at things like the frequency of “bitcoin” in google searches and a third is to evaluate the technical and fundamental metrics – smart analyses from the nic carters and willy woos of the worldrelated first mover market signs look healthy as bitcoin selloff subsidesbut then there’s the qualitative side i wanted to find out how the bull run looks – how it feels – from the perspective of og bitcoin hodlers and if this cycle is different why and where are we headedlet’s start with the kidi ‘an excellent year’when erik finman was  years old his older brother took him to a “very chill protest” in washington dc this was in  finman happened to notice a guy wearing an orange shirt that had a big b in the middle“what’s that” the  askedrelated as bitcoin regains lost ground options traders bet on  move by late january“it’s bitcoin man it’s going to end wall street bro”so the  looked into this bitcoin thing he grew curious and so did his older brother his grandmother had just given him  she thought she didn’t have much longer to live so she gave checks to all of her grandchildren he tried to give it back his grandma wouldn’t take it the check was supposed to go for a scholarship fund but instead the kid used it to buy bitcoin the price of each coin was around  so he bought  bitcoin thanks grandma happily her health improved “she’s actually my only living grandparent now” says finmanstory continuessee also jeff wilser – cathie wood ahead of the curve“bitcoin became an obsession” finman remembers while the rest of his friends were into call of duty or pokemon the  hustled to get more btc texting with strangers to buy and sell “i felt like a wall street broker” he would eventually cobble together over  bitcoinyou know those dotcom wunderkinds who drop out of college that’s nothing when finman was  he dropped out of high school since then he helped start the crypto payments company metal pay built a reallife dr octopus suit inspired by spiderman and launched a satellite with taylor swift it’s easy to connect with t swift says finman “imdbpro lists everyone’s agent it’s only  per month and the agents check their email”during the frenzied  bull run the media couldn’t get enough of the teenage bitcoin millionaire the guardian photographed him sprawled over a pile of cash wearing sunglasses a hundreddollar bill sticking out of his mouth gq covered his streetware but guess who also consumes the media hackers they spotted a rich target and came for his digital gold “i was sick to my stomach” says finman “i got emails that threatened to kill me if i didn’t give them bitcoin” they also threatened his parents even mentioning them by name along with their work addresses“i was terrified to walk on the sidewalk” finman remembers he had insomnia for days the worst of it came on aug   – the day of the eclipse hackers knew that everyone would be staring at the sun and away from their computers so they chose that precise moment to pounce erik watched the eclipse like the rest of the world but he happened to get tired of it a little early he returned to his computer to see crazy flickering and movements on his screen oh st he said to himself and somehow he booted them from his system just in time amazingly he didn’t lose any crypto to hacks but says his email and twitter were compromised for monthsand now his life in the current bull run there are no calls from gq no fawning from the guardian finman has a theory for why this cycle feels so under the radar the cultural space that was once occupied by crypto is now gobbled up by politics and the coronavirus pandemic“ trump gets more clicks than crypto” says finman he thinks of the earlier bull run of  as a “golden era” not just because of the wealth creation but because “you could talk about things other than politics back in the day cool young people were doing cool things and building cool st i feel like that has been lost”he misses going to parties and talking about new apps and crypto instead of trump and pandemics “maybe  biden’s not as interesting as a person” and “he’ll get less clicks” says finman “maybe bitcoin is more interesting than joe biden”finman and i spoke weeks before the mob of trump supporters invaded the capitol but that wrenching day of jan  seemed to encapsulate his point while most of the nation watched horrified as chaos engulfed the nation’s capital which perhaps said something dark about america the price of bitcoin surged another  this is perhaps the great irony of blockchain in  and  the raucous celebrating of bitcoin juxtaposed against so much realworld suffering nearly  million deaths from the coronavirus can seem tonedeafas much of the world grieves for the dead struggles to pay rent or simply tries to make it through the drudgery of quarantine many of the bitcoin bulls whistle a different tune “ was an excellent year” tweets a cheerful crypto investor another gushes that “ was a hell of a year i’ve never seen a market like it and i’m fortunate to have closed it on a high note … not only did i finish at alltime highs but bitcoin has finally given me a clarity that i’ve been seeking for awhile  should be special”ii ‘not yet interesting enough’erik voorhees the ceo of shapeshift has also been around since near the beginning he takes us down memory lane in  the price hit  then the bubble popped and it would crater to  these were dark days for bitcoin “everyone who was skeptical had every reason to believe that it was over” remembers voorhees “all the people hating on bitcoin had a field day for months and months” the next bull cycle wouldn’t come for another two years in  when the price again cracked  voorhees remembers giving a talk at new york university with charlie shrem and during the talk the price pumped  as they celebrated “all of the students thought we were a little weird”voorhees has a contrarian take “it mostly feels the same” he says “when you go through several seasons of this market it feels the same you have this crazy bubble and then a period of denial after the bubble and then a dark bear market for a while and then a period of stabilization and then another period of growth that cycle feels very natural to me” voorhees says you can’t predict how high it will get or when it will crash but the overarching patterns feel consistent and predictablebut does the actual price history bear this out let’s go to the graphs when you first look at a chart that displays the history of bitcoin’s price these patterns are hard to spot it looks like bitcoin is worth peanuts for years then you see the tothemoon bull run of  then the crash and now today many traders look at it differently they switch the scale of the chart to logarithmic which basically plots the percentage change of the pricefor example a jump in price from  to  is a  gain just as a jump from  to  is a  gain both of those jumps would give an investor the same rate of return so they’re displayed the same on the graph and when you switch the chart to logarithmic suddenly you do see the patterns in fact it’s easy to see you see the bull and the bust cycles that repeat several times over the last decade and you see that each time bitcoin “crashes” the new level is higher than the prior cycle looked through this prism  prices look less like wild uncharted territory and more like the smooth continuation of a decadelong trend if you squintas for why we don’t see the same breathless media coverage and why bitcoin is not in the larger cultural conversation “that’s a simple answer” says voorhees and then adds a slab of juicy red meat for the bitcoin bulls “we’re not in the real bubble yet” his logic is that yes bitcoin has surpassed its previous ath but while “everyone in crypto is freaking out and excited because they’re like ‘yes we’re back’” – and while it prompts daily articles from coindesk on each new tick upwards such as    – this is not yet interesting enough to curry much mainstream fascinationa more useful and accurate time comparison for where we are in the current bull cycle says voorhees is not the frothy top of december  when bitcoin flirted with  and when the fomo lured in bitcoin newbies full disclosure i was one of these newbs and i bought bitcoin near the top that i still hodl voorhees says a better comparison for where we are is february of  when bitcoin had once again breached  – after three years of wallowing in the tripledigits – and established what was then a new athfollow the logic further “it’s not yet interesting to the mainstream the super mainstream interest occurs at the tailend of the bubble” as for when that will happen “when we approach  grand that’s when you’ll see it all over the place and that means  in the latter stages of the cycle” voorhees guesses that the current cycle will take bitcoin “somewhere between  and ” and that this will occur “between six and  months from now” and then “the bubble will pop and it will crash down over the next year probably back below  and probably never below ”iii ‘plebs buy to sell chads buy to buy more’my personal theory in the last bull run there was still the widespread hope that we could use bitcoin as a way to buy a proverbial cup of coffee this made bitcoin easy to understand this made it easy to talk about the “how to use bitcoin” story was catnip for mainstream publications offering easy hooks for pieces like business insider’s “i spent a day trying to pay for things with bitcoin and a bar of gold” but widespread merchant adoption never happened those stories faded the mainstream lost interest and the actual use case of bitcoin is now trickier to convey “a hedge against inflation as rampant monetary easing dilutes the dollar” is a tough bumper stickersomething else is different now back in  much of the nation still had never heard of bitcoin which made it easy for the producers of abc news say to greenlight a segment like “what is bitcoin the world’s most popular cryptocurrency” segments like this were everywhere the today show asked “what is cryptocurrency and should you risk your money with it” now those explainer videos have already been done that abc producer would likely ask “didn’t we already run this story old news pass”the peak of ’s news coverage came in the new york times’ “everyone’s getting hilariously rich and you’re not” the top image of that article featured two crypto bros — one wearing a bitcoin sweater one wearing an ethereum sweater which it must be said is tougher on the eyes than the ugliest christmas sweater i reached out to the ethereum sweater guy whose name is mathieu baril who’s now operations lead at derivadex a crypto exchange to see what’s changed between now and then“the  euphoria was strange” baril remembers as the san francisco meetups became “a bit more crazy” and full of those trying to get rich quick at one  meetup baril says “some people were walking next to pieter wuille and didn’t even know he was a core dev” baril says that while he’s now seeing that same kind of getrichquick euphoria with decentralized finance defi the bitcoin run itself feels less hypey more solidto those following the space closely the drivers of the bull run are now well understood an influx of institutional capital such as microstrategy’s trove of over  btc growing optimism from traditional finance like jpmorgan floating a price of  and a grudging appreciation for bitcoin as “digital gold” that can hedge against inflation“this bull run was catalyzed by covid” says jill carlson principal of slow ventures and a coindesk columnist “over  of all us dollars were created in  this staggering statistic rightly has asset managers fearing inflation and turning to bitcoin”that institutional capital didn’t just appear by magic it took years of behindthescenes work the secret engine of this bull run could have something to do with an obscure bit of paperwork called an “soc  audit” says moe adham cofounder of bitaccess a canadian startup soc stands for “system and organization controls” and while it might lack the sex appeal of “the big bang theory” or a  jamie foxxbacked ico it could have a more enduring impactin the last bull run of  says adham it was extremely difficult if not impossible “for listed companies and institutions to actually invest in bitcoin and carry that balance over a year’send and satisfy a financial audit” it’s one thing for you or me to scoop up some bitcoin on an exchange but adham says that a “listed company” such as square needs a more buttonedup custodian that can withstand the rigors of an soc  auditfor the last few years the rise of institutional custodians such as bitgo gemini and coinbase have quietly built out the pipes and plumbing to make these kinds of soc audits doable “from a regulatory and compliance perspective bitgo … has been hammering away at this problem for a very long time” says mike belshe ceo of bitgo “we’re a regulated institution anybody outside of our walls that’s regulated needs to work with regulated parties so now they’ve got partners that they can work with”jill carlson agrees with those who say that this bull run feels different “that institutional money will be stickier and have a stronger hand” she says adding that it will “open the door for even more institutional money to pour in” unlike in  carlson notes the bulk of the incoming funds are for the relatively more proven assets of bitcoin and ethereum as compared to the rampant gambling on the more exotic blockchain projects that lured speculators with visions of  returns many of which have gone bustthe idea of institutional “strong hands” makes sense dovey wan founding partner of primitive ventures says wealthy individuals who allocate only a small slice of their pie to bitcoin are able to outlast the inevitable dips in price whereas the “weaker hands” don’t have that luxury “if you have a small net worth you can’t hodl a large percentage of bitcoin due to price volatility” explains wan or as she once posted on weibo “plebs buy to sell chads buy to buy more”while wan who’s based in hong kong agrees this is a fundamentally different bull market than in  and  she notes that it’s not perceived the same way around the globe china still has a more bearish view “most chinese traders and crypto people have not been following the ‘institutional influx’ from the west closely and domestically crypto sentiment has always been more bearish due to local regulatory stiffening” explains wan such as the regulators cracking down on exchanges and mining or the imprisonment of chinese exchange founders like star xuwan says the difference in crypto sentiment between the east and west is so stark a savvy trader can make easy money by shorting bitcoin during china’s daytime and going long bitcoin during the us daytime “it’s a simple straight alpha strategy since ”iv ‘filling itself out’marshall hayner started mining bitcoin on the original  macbook pro which fried his laptop when he brought it into the apple repair shop the guys laughed at him for mining “bitcoin” which they had never heard of trading was tough there was no coinbase or binance or even a mt gox back then they bartered with bitcoin for things like tshirts socks and visa gift cards – ironic given bitcoin’s antibank ethos “i just wanted to prove to myself does this really work” says hayner they traded in forums and chat rooms the goal was not to make money but to experiment and playin  hayner had scooped up enough bitcoin that he remembers thinking if this thing ever goes to  i’ll be a millionaire when it did finally hit  he happened to arrive in belize for a vacation with his girlfriend practically as soon as the plane landed he told his girlfriend that he needed to leave because he had to go back home and access the hardware wallet on his computer to sell crypto she wasn’t thrilled so he raced back home to boston desperate to cash out and get rich … but while he was on his flight the price plunged  back to  the good news is he would eventually become a millionaire the bad news is the girlfriend didn’t lastthen came the  bull run when bitcoin shot from  to  in just under a year “ was the moment when it actually proved to have real commodity value” says hayner who’s now the ceo of metal pay he launched it with erik finman the teenage bitcoin millionaire banks in greece and cyprus failed atms ran out of money europeans were hungry for an alternative to fiat this wasn’t just speculation or fomo – people bought bitcoin to use it “incremental demand for bitcoin is coming from the geographic areas most affected by the cypriot financial crisis – individuals in countries like greece or spain worried that they will be next to feel the threat of deposit taxes” one fintech analyst wrote at the timeif  was driven by greek and cyprus demand and  driven by retail speculation or hype and fomo what does that mean for today “ is the year where most people have heard about bitcoin and most people have heard about cryptocurrency” hayner reasons so they’re investing with eyes wide open “this time around almost everyone knows what this is”if everyone knows what bitcoin is that might explain why the google search results aren’t anywhere near the booming heyday of december  but that could be changing just a month ago when i began researching this article searches for “bitcoin” were only about  of that december peak now it’s climbing just in the past week as the price of bitcoin shattered records by the hour the searches more than doubled this gives some ammo to voorhees’ theory the public will catch up if the price keeps rocketinganecdotally it does seem like the pace of bitcoin chitchat has started to pick up i’m now getting texts from buddies asking how to buy crypto which hasn’t happened since early  and now we see sentiments like this “helped my  grandmother put her  stimulus check in bitcoin yesterday” one user tweeted on jan  “she gave me instructions to distribute it between her children in the case of her death her mother lived to  … personally helping mint a new hodler every week as of late”i spoke with one last oldschool bitcoiner to get some perspective “i’ve lost count but i’ve been through seven or eight of these bull cycles” says charlie shrem the founder of the early and now legendarily defunct exchange bitinstant and who – perhaps more than anyone – has seen both the peaks easy millions and valleys jail time of crypto and who is now hosting the podcast untold stories chronicling the history of bitcoin “ to   to   to  and now  to maybe  or plus” says shrem almost nostalgically “this one was inevitable”shrem suspects the bitcoin price is “filling itself out” in the same way that an air mattress needs to be filled before it can support your weight in other words if bitcoin is to actually be the relevant currency that its advocates envision then the price almost must rise and keep on rising just as an air mattress needs to be filled otherwise it won’t do what it’s supposed to do he acknowledges it’s also possible that it goes to zero“i think bitcoin wants to be a sixfigure number” says shrem “and i think people who own bitcoin now want to see the value of one bitcoin be a sixfigure number” it’d be tough to find a bitcoin owner who would disagree but then again every owner of shares in petscom a posterchild disaster from the dotcom era wanted to see it go to the moonshrem like nearly everyone who spoke to me says that this one really does feel different for the prior bull cycles even for the cryptooptimists he says there was always an undercurrent of anxiety as the price ascended like watching “a rocket ship that takes off and every time there’s a  chance that something will go wrong” now he doesn’t feel that anxiety he sees less of the fomo less of the hype less of the greed “i don’t see anyone talking about lambos on twitter” says shremthen again as one crypto enthusiast tweets “lambo bro bitcoin to the moon bro”related stories
