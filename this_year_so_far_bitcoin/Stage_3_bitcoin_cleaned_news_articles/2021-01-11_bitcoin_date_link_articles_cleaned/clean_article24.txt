before i go on i just want to mention that i don’t own bitcoin at the moment and in fact i don’t and never have owed any cryptocurrencies i mention this because i want to give those who think i’m not qualified to comment on the market since i don’t have any skin in the game to stop reading any furtheri don’t analyze bitcoin on a daily basis but since it is a competing asset with stocks bonds and gold to name a few i am aware of the price action in the market so i wouldn’t call myself completely naïve to its movementin  i wrote only one article on bitcoin it was published on october  on fxempirecom i didn’t just wake up that day and decide to write about i saw some movement in the market on the chart that raised my interest and i decided to investigate it furtheri concluded at that time that paypal’s entry into the cryptocurrency market was behind the move this wasn’t a guess but rather my knowledge and experience behind what moves a market i am mainly a technician but after years of experience i think i have a good grasp on how the fundamentals and technicals work togetheri believe the technicals precede the fundamentals which is why the  spike in prices encouraged me to delve into the fundamental reason behind the movewhat really surprised me about bitcoin wasn’t the price action but the lack of really good technical and fundamental analysis i acknowledge that i’ve seen the articles on halving and mining and such but i’m confused by most of the analysisi read comments and analysis but i don’t know if these experts are longterm investors or shortterm traders i do know this just about every bitcoin analyst slaps a few percentage retracement lines on a chart and thinks they are helping an investor decide what to do but my biggest beef is that very few every day analysts are telling me if i should buy it or sell it but mostly what’s my exit if i’m wrongprior to the big rally from about  to  there were very few fresh articles published on fxempire but once it started to climb sometimes thousands of dollars per day and it took out the  level many articles were published and of course the obligatory  target pieces were writtenwhat i’ve concluded is that bitcoin analysts love momentum when its breaking out to the upside but when it comes to selloffs very little is written i mean who doesn’t like a volatility breakout when all you have to do is throw out targets
