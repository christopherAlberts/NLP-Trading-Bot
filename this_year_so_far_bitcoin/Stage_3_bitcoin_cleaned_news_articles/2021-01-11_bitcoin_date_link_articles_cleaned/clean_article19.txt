what happenedthe worlds largest cryptocurrency is bitcoin and its price is plunging bitcoin tokens nearly reached a price of  late last week but on monday bitcoin briefly dipped below   more than a  drop in a matter of daysas might be expected any stock that has anything to do with bitcoin specifically or cryptocurrencies in general is down today several stocks are down by more than  as investors take profits off the table following a great runamong the hardest hit cryptocurrency stocks today are bitcoin miners like marathon patent group nasdaqmara riot blockchain nasdaqriot bit digital nasdaqbtbt and cleanspark nasdaqclsk which were down    and  respectively as of  pm estso whatwhile i dont know for sure its possible an article from british newspaper the times sparked the bitcoin crash according to that article people wont be able to transfer profits out of cryptocurrency exchanges and into their hsbc bank accounts if youre buying bitcoin and altcoins as an investment youre assuming youll be able to realize those gains in fiat currency someday but if hsbc can block transfers could other banks make similar announcements it seems the possibility is sparking a panicked rush for the exits from bitcoinoperational businesses like marathon patent group riot blockchain bit digital and cleanspark are engaged in providing computing power to the bitcoin blockchain network and they generate revenue in bitcoin so if bitcoins value relative to fiat currency drops then revenue for miners is worth less in the real world explaining the drops in these stockshowever bitcoin mining stocks are probably among the most pumped smallcap stocks in this space as well many of these are multibagger stocks in a matter of weeks and their trading volume is rivaling that of largecap stocks the implication is theyre firmly controlled by traders with shortterm interestsgenerally speaking if shortterm traders have bid these stocks up its not surprising to see them fall with the first sign that the party is over there wasnt any companyspecific news from marathon or riot blockchain to explain their drops other than the price of bitcoin cleanspark was giving a virtual roadshow but the stock fell long before it started  nothing bad happened at the roadshow to explain why the stock is downas of this writing bit digitals website was down according to isitdownrightnowcom so its unclear whether this bitcoin miner which until recently was a carrental business has news relevant to shareholders by the way if it sounds crazy that a car rental company turned to bitcoin mining wait until you meet future fintech group nasdaqftft a former fruit juice company thats now developing blockchain technology for ecommerce both companies do business in chinafuture fintech group owns  of dcon digipay limited which operates in japan according to news released today by the company dcon digipay limited has completed work on a product that will allow ecommerce platforms to accept bitcoin as a form of payment since future fintech group has ecommerce sites in china this technology could likely be integrated quickly its the kind of news that would typically send a stock like this flying but since bitcoin is down and hype is muted today future fintech stock was down  despite its press releasenow whatso what if more banks start blocking transfers from cryptocurrency exchanges if bitcoin remains a popular investment then that might be good news for grayscale bitcoin trust otcgbtc even though its down  today the fund trades over the counter but holds bitcoin the idea is it allows people to invest in bitcoin through their traditional stock brokerage accountsaccording to the funds website the current value of its bitcoin assets is significantly less than the price of shares this of course seems illogical  why would you pay more for shares of a fund than the underlying bitcoin is worth but it shows theres demand for this investment vehicle not everyone wants to set up an account with a cryptocurrency exchange in order to own bitcoin directly leaving grayscale bitcoin trust as one of the only optionsif more banks block transfers then investing through cryptocurrency exchanges would become less attractive therefore its possible there could be more demand for grayscale bitcoin trust however the funds value is still tied to the price of bitcoin so investors must do research to form an opinion on where bitcoin is headed and whether this fund with its associated fees is something that fits their needs
