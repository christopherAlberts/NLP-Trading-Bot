boosting its forecast for this year’s growth to  from  at the start of the yeara key question for the inflation watchers of course is just how much stimulus money will be pumped into the economy by the us government and the federal reservepresident joe biden has proposed a  trillion stimulus bill but a group of senators from the opposition republican party on monday released details of a  billion proposal they argue is more appropriate bank of america’s analysts assume the package will end up around  trillionwhy it matters is that as americans start to get out and about a surge in consumer spending looks likely the bank of america analysts estimate there’s already some  trillion of excess savings that might start to trickle into the economy“the jolt from stimulus the support of excess savings and the green light from lower virus cases should unleash pentup consumer spending” the bank of america economists wrote “stronger growth means a lower unemployment rate and greater inflation pressure”that outlook raises the question of how the fed might respond with fed chair jerome powell stating last week that it’s “too early to be talking about dates“ for tapering the central bank’s  of bond purchases – funded via printing more money – that are currently ongoing to provide stimulus to financial marketsby the middle of this year if the economy is recovering quickly powell and his colleagues might find it harder to characterize any talk of tapering as still too soon because these are typically welltelegraphed affairs the actual tapering might start six to seven months after that call it early “we believe the fed will have difficulty justifying persistently large asset purchases in the face of a sustainable decrease in  cases economic overheating and frothy asset prices” according to bank of americaon the other hand the fed might flinch“we can envision a scenario whereby the fed signals an intention to taperstarts tapering markets react negatively and the fed finds that they need to continue purchasing or extend the duration of their purchases in order to preserve market functioning” according to bank of americait’s that latter scenario – or even just the prospect of it – that might drive bitcoin prices a lot higher based on the reluctance of central bankers to withdraw stimulus not to mention the market lurches late last year when a new us stimulus bill seemed in doubt the scenario isn’t all that implausible– bradley keounbitcoin watchbitcoin and us dollar index daily charts source tradingviewcoindeskbitcoin’s ongoing range play between  and
