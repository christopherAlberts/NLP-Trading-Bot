who lost myanmarfor hillary clinton the meeting with aung san suu kyi in late  was a moment of both professional triumph and personal celebrationclinton then the us secretary of state was in yangon myanmar to sit down with the woman she called her “inspiration” as part of a broader if undeclared us strategy to drive a wedge between nations on china’s perimeter and beijing including longisolated myanmar under the aegis of the obama administration’s “pivot” to asia and during a tenure at the state department in which clinton hadn’t accomplished much beyond hardtoned speeches and “soft” diplomacy her opening to myanmar was a rare diplomatic victory a year later barack obama became the first sitting us president to visit the country ostensibly to promote democracy but also to nudge myanmar closer to washington’s sphere of influencea decade later that strategy lies in ruins aung san suu kyi the nobel prizewinning democracy activist who hosted clinton and later ran the country is back in detention after the military launched yet another coup on monday nor is there much diplomacy afoot such is her estrangement from washington today that in the week before aung san suu kyi’s arrest the biden administration fearing just this outcome had tried and failed to get in contact with herbut if the us strategy is in ruins so is aung san suu kyi’s reputation while many in the west have in recent days called for her release she is no longer the heroine and humanrights icon she once was her coldblooded assent to the army’s slaughter of the muslim rohingya minority has soured her image around the world to the point where some democracy activists have petitioned oslo to revoke her nobel once a magnet for human rights pressure on myanmar from abroad today she remains largely isolated internationallythe coup that seems to have hurled myanmar back three decades is another grim  lesson in the difficulties of democracy and the staying power of authoritarianism—and the limitations of diplomacy in building a bridge between the twowhile most western governments including the united states condemned the myanmar military’s actions most authoritarian states led by china did not beijing which has long resisted the us policy of wooing its client states in southeast asia described the coup as a “cabinet reshuffle” last month the chinese government’s top diplomat wang yi visited myanmar to meet with military chief min aung hlaing aung san suu kyi’s nemesis—and this week the new ruler of the countryus president joe biden’s foreignpolicy team knows the myanmar challenge well because many of its members were present at the creation jake sullivan now national security advisor was in  clinton’s deputy chief of staff and head of policy planning kurt campbell now on the national security council was at the time the asia head for the state department and played an intimate role in orchestrating the new strategybut unlike a decade ago biden’s team now must reckon with a bizarre echo of former president donald trump’s attempt to undermine biden’s own thumping election victory at home after aung san suu kyi’s national league for democracy nld won even more votes in the november  election than it had in  the myanmar military just as trump did declared the vote fraudulent without any evidence—and then it arrested herand for better or worse unlike in  the united states doesn’t have the unalloyed appeal of aung san suu kyi to turn to as myanmar began its transition to democracy her continuing high popularity inside the country was a chronic threat to the military junta us diplomats were acutely aware of this and sought to leverage the lifting of sanctions by making her consent to free and fair elections part of the deal eager to get on good terms with the regime—as aung san suu kyi herself reportedly was—clinton dropped her demand for a united nationsbacked war crimes probe proffered immediate aid and gave her assent to the military regime’s control over electionsin some ways the pace and scope of us engagement with myanmar were driven by aung san suu kyi asked in an interview with the bbc in  whether she had conceded too much clinton replied that washington was depending on aung san suu kyi’s assent saying that “from her perspective it’s important to validate the political process”that continued for years despite sometimes intense internal debate in the obama administration over easing sanctions when in  obama pledged to lift sanctions on myanmar declaring that “it is the right thing to do in order to ensure that the people of burma see rewards from a new way of doing business and a new government” aung san suu kyi herself gave the green light “we think that the time has now come to remove all the sanctions that hurt us economically” so that foreign businesses could invest she said—even though the country had not as the us road map presupposed progressed toward democracy even after her party won the  elections—with onequarter of parliament reserved for the military in any event—she was denied the presidency because she had been married to a foreigner and had children with foreign citizenshipnow the biden administration appears ready to start the whole cycle over again saying it is “rolling back” sanctions relief in the words of white house press secretary jen psaki and suggesting new sanctions are coming but the administration at first temporized even over calling the military takeover a coup according to several news reports and it’s not clear the old playbook will work again if it ever did before the united states and other western countries maintained sanctions on myanmar for decades with little progress toward democracy defenders of the obama administration’s approach say that while it’s true some of the new team participated in the earlier diplomacy four years in the interim under trump have emboldened autocrats everywhere making diplomacy more difficult and aung san suu kyi’s efforts to gain power democratically more elusiveand it’s not clear that aung san suu kyi is the solution if she ever was some myanmar experts believe that confident in her domestic popularity she might have overestimated her political strength and made too many demands of the junta—and particularly of min aung hlaing the new ruler“i think it’s possible that she could have agreed to some concessions that would have averted the coup” said christina fink a myanmar expert at george washington university that could have meant allowing min aung hlaing to stay on as commander in chief or perhaps even to take the nominal presidency “but the nld didn’t want to play ball” fink saidothers say she was playing an impossible game “people have always projected onto her something that she’s not she always said ‘i’m a politician nothing more’” said robert lieberman a cornell university physics professor and filmmaker who made the  film they call it myanmar lifting the curtain and who interviewed the nld leader extensively “she had no choice in the sense that she’s always been on a tight wire balanced between the military and the rest of the world”except that the rest of the world after aung san suu kyi sought to cover up the military’s atrocities against the rohingya at a hearing in front of the un international court of justice in  no longer has her on a pedestalnow the new junta is counting on less of an outcry from former supporters of the oncesainted dissident and a larger comfort zone in a world where authoritarian governments have had four years of encouragement under trump and the biden team that once sought to romance the stoneheaded generals of myanmar may end up with a lot fewer levers for change than it once hadfeb  this story has been updated with
