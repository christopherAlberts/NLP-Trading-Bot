if you have clicked to read this article you probably want to know what is blockchain whether you’ve been watching finance trading or cryptocurrencies over the last ten years you may have used the word “blockchain” the recordkeeping infrastructure behind the bitcoin network the blockchain is an no doubt a genius and innovative technology – the brainchild of an individual or a group of people known as the alias satoshi nakamoto but since then it has developed into something bigger and the key question that every normal individual asks is what is blockchainblockchainwhat does it meansblockchain does seem to be complex and difficult and it can certainly be but its basic principle is rather simplistic a blockchain is a database type to be capable of understanding blockchain it helps if you first grasp what the database is the database is a compilation of records stored digitally on a file server details or information in databases is usually arranged in a table format to enable the search and filtering of relevant information what’s the discrepancy between those using a chart to store data instead of a databasethe spreadsheets are intended for one individual or a small proportion of people to save and view restricted volumes of information on the other hand the database is built to hold far greater volumes of data that can be viewed filtered and modified rapidly and efficiently by any number of participants in one go this is accomplished by massive files storing data on servers that are made up of advanced models these servers may sometimes be designed using hundreds and thousands of machines to provide the computing power and storage space required for multiple users to reach the database at the same time while a chart or database may be readily available to any number of people it is often operated by a company and controlled by a designated individual who has full control over how it operates and the information within itso how is the blockchain different from the databasewhat is blockchain in relation to bitcoin storage structureone major difference between a standard database and a blockchain is how the information is processed a blockchain gathers data in groups also widely acknowledged as blocks that carries information sets blocks have specific storage capabilities and when loaded are linked to the previously loaded block creating a chain of records known as the blockchain all new details that accompany that the recently introduced block is collected into a recently established block which will then be incorporated into the chain once loadedthe database processes its data into tables while the blockchain as its term suggests constructs its data into clumps blocks that are tied next to each other this means that all blockchains are database management systems but not all databases are blockchains this structure also fundamentally provides an irretrievable timeline for data to be enforced in a decentralized manner when the block is loaded it is written in stone and becomes a component of the timeline an accurate time tag is assigned to each block in the chain when it is entered into the system of blockchaindecentralization systemstill asking what is blockchain for the goal of clarifying blockchain it is enlightening to perceive it from the perspective of how bitcoin has been put into effect like a database bitcoin requires a compilation of computing devices to store the blockchain for bitcoin this blockchain is just a particular type of data structure that holds each bitcoin payment that has ever been made in the case of bitcoin and unlike most datasets not all of these computing devices are under one roof and each device or set of computer programs is controlled by one person or a group of individualsassume that a company owns a server consisting of  computing devices with a dataset containing all the relevant data on its customer’s account the corporation has a storage facility comprising all of these computing devices under one roof and has total ownership over all of these machines and all the details they consist of likewise bitcoin comprises millions of devices but each device or set of computer programs holding its blockchain is located in a different geographical location and they’ve all been controlled by different individuals or groups of people these devices that make up the bitcoin system are referred to as nodesin this method the bitcoin blockchain is being used in a decentralized manner even so there are confidential centralized blockchains where the devices that make up its system are acquired and run by a single institution in a blockchain each node has a detailed history of the information that’s just been collected on the blockchain since its beginnings for bitcoin the data content is the whole history of all bitcoin transactions and functions if a node has a mistake in its information it will use dozens of several other nodes as a point of comparison to rectify itself this way no one else on the system can modify the data gathered inside the system just because of that the history of exchanges in each of the blocks that make up the blockchain of bitcoin is irreversibleif one node tries to mess with bitcoin’s database table all other nodes can crossreference one another and quickly locate the node with the wrong details this method helps to create an exact and straightforward sequence of events for bitcoin this data is a record of purchases although it is often conceivable for a blockchain to contain a range of information such as legal contracts state ids or the company’s product storage to alter the way the mechanism operates or the data held within it the bulk of the processing resources of the autonomous network will need to vote on those improvements this means that any improvements that arise are in the best interests of the boardwhat is blockchain and the transparency of the blockchaindue to the decentralized existence of bitcoin’s blockchain all payments can be transparently seen either by getting a personal node or by using blockchain portals that enable everyone to see transfers happening live each node does have its duplicate of the chain that is modified as new blocks are validated and inserted this implies that if you needed to you would be able to monitor bitcoin everywhere it goestransactions were breached in the past where those who kept bitcoin on the platform lost everything although the hacker might be completely anonymous the bitcoins they harvested are detectable if the bitcoins that were taken in any of these attacks were to be transferred or invested elsewhere it would have been knownis blockchain protectedblockchain computing is responsible for encryption and confidence problems in a variety of ways first of all fresh blocks are always placed sequentially and chronologically that is they’re every time placed to the “end” of the blockchain if you take a glance at bitcoin’s blockchain you’ll find that every unit has a chain style called “height” as of november  the height of the block had approached  blocks thus faronce a block has been attached to the end of the blockchain it is quite complicated to step backward and modify the data of the block until the majority has formed a decision to do so this is because each node receives its very own hash together with the hash of the block before it as well as the timing mark listed above hash codes are formed by a math sequence that converts electronic data into a series of numbers and alphabets if this data is modified in any manner the hash code alters as wellthis is why it’s critical to protect let’s presume the intruder tries to change the blockchain to snatch the bitcoin from everybody else if they were to change their single copy it will no more be in sync with anyone else’s version if anyone else crossreferences their versions of one another they will see this one replica stood out and the hacker’s copy of the chain would be tossed out as invalidprogress in such a breach will require the intruder to concurrently manipulate and change  percent of the versions of the blockchain so that their current copy became a majority replica and therefore an agreedupon chain such an invasion would also take a large amount of money and effort since they would also require to rewrite all the blocks so they would now have various serial numbers timing tags and hash keysdue to the scale of the bitcoin infrastructure and how quickly it is developing the expense of carrying off such a stunt is likely to be impossible to overcome not only will this be incredibly costly but it would be pointless making such a move would not go unheard since users of the network would see these dramatic improvements to the blockchain the members of the organization would then switch on to a new iteration of the chain that was not compromisedthis will cause the targeted copy of bitcoin to fall in value rendering the attack essentially futile when a malicious person has possession of a meaningless commodity the same would happen if the bad guy were to target the latest bitcoin fork it is structured in such a manner that participating in the platform is much more financially incentivized than targeting itconclusionfirst suggested as a research experiment in  blockchain is safely established in its late twenties blockchain has had its great deal of media attention over the past two decades with corporations around the globe making assumptions on what it is worthy of and where it will be going in the generations to followwith many realistic uses for software already being applied and studied blockchain is gradually building a reputation for itself at the age of twentyseven in no minor portion because of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a buzz phrase on the lips of any investor in the world blockchain hopes to profit company and government operations more reliable effective safe and inexpensive with fewer middlemen we hope that you know are able to answer the question what is blockchain
