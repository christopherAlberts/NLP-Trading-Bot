bitcoin is widely regarded as the first major cryptocurrency invented in  by an anonymous person under the pseudonym of “satoshi nakamoto” at the time one bitcoin could be purchased for as little as  why is it worth so much here lies the milliondollar question unlike other assets such as property resources or traditional equities bitcoin does not have a product or commodity tied to its value it does not generate cashflow and is primarily used as a means of storing and transferring value with this in mind it is tough for finance traditionalists to wrap their heads around why someone might pay  for a seemingly worthless virtual coin however the idea becomes far more acceptable when comparing bitcoin to another classic investment – physical gold caroline bowler chief executive of major australian cryptocurrency exchange btcmarkets says the two assets are remarkably similar noting that gold was still valuable despite other metals being shinier and more functional“gold has become accepted as a form of currency and a form of value that is easily transferable and bitcoin takes that to the next level because the transfers are quicker it’s easier to fractionalise there is less hassle and it is far more secure” she says bitcoin is also limited by its programming so there can only be  million coins in existence this is attractive from an investment standpoint ms bowler says “you can’t just go and devalue the currency by printing more and that’s one of the many facets of bitcoin that investors find reassuring” she said is it the only cryptocurrency no there are hundreds of other cryptocurrency alternatives to bitcoin each with their own use cases and value proposition much like how there are multiple shares on a stock exchangesome of the most notable are ethereum a platform which allows users to execute automatic contracts ripple a payment service popular amongst institutions and banks and litecoin however bitcoin is comfortably the largest and most wellknown cryptocurrency with a market capitalisation of more than  billion how do you buy it buying crypto is as easy as buying shares investors can use a range of online exchanges to trade bitcoin along with most other major cryptocurrencies you don’t have to splash out  for an entire bitcoin you can buy just a fragment of one cointrading apps such as coinbase are popular for buying smaller amounts all platforms require users to complete a “know your customer” process for antimoney laundering purposes and purchases can usually be financed by bank transfer if an exchange collapses and loses your coins the government won’t step in to reimburse your lost funds i’ve got some so where do i store it after buying bitcoin or another cryptocurrency the coins are stored in a “wallet” on the platform these “wallets” can store any number of currencies and are a key part of trading crypto much like a trading account with a broker only you can access the coins inside the wallethowever while storing small amounts of cryptocurrencies on exchanges is generally safe if your purchases begin to stretch into the thousands a personal wallet is highly advisable ms bowler advises taking personal custody of your bitcoin as regulation in the crypto space is fairly lax if an exchange collapses and loses your coins the government won’t step in to reimburse your lost funds powerful computers are required to mine bitcoin creditqilai shen companies such as ledger and trezor offer personal cryptocurrency wallets for as little as  the devices look similar to usb sticks and connect via software on your computer which allows you to transfer your precious crypto across when setting up a personal wallet you are presented with two crucial pieces of information firstly each wallet has a public key which is a string of numbers and letters which allows you to receive coins into your wallet much like a bsb number and bank accountloading secondly – and far more importantly – each wallet includes a private key which is a secret number which grants full access to your wallet these keys often come in the form of a  or  recovery phrase comprising of a string of random words this phrase is the master key to your bitcoin and should be protected and stored somewhere secure if you lose your wallet your private key will still grant you access to your coins but if you lose your private key and cannot gain access to your wallet your coins will be lost forever it is worth noting that your bitcoins are not actually stored in your wallet the keys mentioned above only give you the right to access your bitcoin which is stored on the blockchain wallets only serve to store and protect your private key
