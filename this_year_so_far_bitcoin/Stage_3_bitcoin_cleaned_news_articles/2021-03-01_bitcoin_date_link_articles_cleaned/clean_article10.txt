 a beginner’s guide to bitcoin what are “altcoins” and are any worth investing in a beginner’s guide to bitcoin the technical genius behind bitcoin and the blockchain – and how it all worksif i only had a bitcoin for every time i’d heard someone say “i don’t understand it” even after i explain bitcoin – and i’m pretty good at explaining stuff – many still shake their head and say “i still don’t get it” often i think this is wilful ignorance bitcoin does take some effort to get to grips with the concept of a money system that is not stateissued is hard for many to wrap their heads around and the tech can be a little baffling to nontechies so the easy route for many is to say “i don’t understand it” and walk away don’t be one of those people simple explanations of bitcoin may leave you with more questions than answers but that is all part of the process of coming to terms with the idea of a new system of money you don’t need to understand bitcoin to use it i will explain the tech in simple terms below but the first thing i would stress – and i am so keen to stress this that i am going to put it in bold italics – is this you do not need to understand the tech in order to use it• do you understand how hypertext transfer protocol works no and yet you still use the world wide web every day • do you understand how simple mail transfer protocol works no and yet how often do you send emails • do you understand the combustion engine or the science of antibiotics or nuclear fission and yet you drive a car take medicine and use electricity i will also say this do you know how money – and i am talking about national currencies such as the pound dollar or euro – really works do you know how it is created do you understand the difference between   and  money supply do you understand interest rates most of us don’t and even those who do still don’t appear to understand how all of these things interact with each other and yet we all use it so if you do not understand the tech – and in all probability you won’t – that does not mean you should not use bitcoin do not let that be your excuse nevertheless here we explain with devastating clarity once and for all what bitcoin is bitcoin is a new system of money designed for the internet let’s shorten that to bitcoin is money for the internet the internet is essentially a borderless medium i’m in the uk i can communicate with someone in the us australia south america asia or africa as instantly as though they were in my own country i can send them messages photos videos any kind of content and they receive it instantly yet until bitcoin i couldn’t send them money with the same ease i would have to go through paypal or a bank or a credit card company there would be foreign exchange costs money transfer costs regulatory processeswith bitcoin i can send money across the net direct from person a to person b just as i send messages it might be tiny sums but it could also be billions for example only recently i saw that somebody had transferred  bitcoins that’s over half a billion dollars in value i know that that value was transacted – the transaction was broadcast on the blockchain but i have no idea who sent the money or to which location it was sent i rather suspect it was elon musk – but who knows i also know that the cost of the transfer was a few dollars and that the transfer was almost instantaneous how did bitcoin come about bitcoin was invented in  in reaction to all the moneyprinting policies that were adopted to bail out the banking system bitcoin’s creator the still anonymous satoshi nakamoto wanted to create a system of money that was apolitical and resistant to state actors in other words a politician or central banker couldn’t start printing this currency even if they deemed the circumstances demanded it bitcoin’s inflation rate is set out in its code with full transparency moreover nakamoto wanted to design a deflationary system of money central bankers and governments can create pounds or dollars when it suits them thus fiat money is an inherently inflationary system of money – the supply of money never stops growing nakamoto wanted to code a system of money that is finite there will only ever be  million bitcoins by making it finite by limiting supply you make it desirable like gold its rarity makes it precious
