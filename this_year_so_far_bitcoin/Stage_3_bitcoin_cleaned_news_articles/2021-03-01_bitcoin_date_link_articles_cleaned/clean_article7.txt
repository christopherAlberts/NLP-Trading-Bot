there are strawberries growing in the village of neuville quebec in the middle of a canadian winter the small farm le caveau à légumes is funneling the excess heat from crypto miners to battle the frost and grow a rarity for the region“now is really cold so we need the heat” melissa girard an agronomist at the small producer told coindesk in a phone interview “we couldn’t afford to produce strawberries if we had to pay for electricity”the farm is among a growing number of businesses and individuals turning to crypto mining for supplementary income but approaching the highly consumptive

distributed network eliminates centralized and trusted parties by trading energy for consensus miners – essentially specialized graphics chips designed to churn through cryptographic math problems – audit the network and receive the occasional subsidy for that worksome see this as an inborn inefficiency others as a necessary price to pay for an open and uncensorable payment network no matter your view however it’s a fact that bitcoin mining expends a ton of powercambridge university estimates the global bitcoin network consumes more energy than ukraine did in  this figure has certainly increased along with the cryptocurrency’s meteoric price rise which draws in lessefficient miners that could now operate in profit this is to say nothing of another bitcoin externality heatenterprising folks see that byproduct as crypto mining’s saving grace for most of bitcoin’s existence it has not been economical for individuals to participate in the network by mining but with a

manufacturer heatmine also based in the region which never got off the groundfounded by jonathan forte heatmine pitched itself as an ethical solution to crypto’s worrisome environmental footprint the manufacturer wanted to offer a way for home and business owners to spin up a miner earn passive income and recycle some of the heat generated in the processwhile the startup has folded the website is offline and forte now says his partners “never delivered” the idea has taken hold even without dedicated heatproducing minersjonathan forte formerly of heatmine is producing cryptominers geared for greenhouses in canada jonathan fortekevin carthy founder of bitcoin atm operator winnipegbtc has been reducing his carbon footprint while participating in the bitcoin mining ecosystem by recycling heat into his office since  he said in a direct message he also uses it to keep his “little electric car warm in the winter” he saidcanada’s cheap energy and cold weather make it the ideal location to “mine for heat” he said while our conversation ran short carthy estimated his cost in  to operate a bitcoin miner at  with revenue of  in crypto per month“we have cold weather and we have inexpensive hydro” carthy told local news station ctv news “you mine for heat and you still make a profit”christian haschek a computer scientist and tech blogger recently started solomining ether eth in his home in austria christian haschekthose figures line up with returns seen by other people experimenting with smallscale crypto mining christian haschek a computer scientist and tech blogger recently started solomining ether eth in his home in austria“it has always been my lifelong wish to warm my home with the server heat” haschek said after designing his own environmentally efficient house which is primarily powered by solar energy he started experimentinghaschek uses four crypto miners that run at about °f to preheat the air in his central ventilation system “it’s basically just a funnel” he said “it’s a pretty lowtech solution” even still he said the incoming eth covered half his electricity bill in january while also lowering the heat pump’s electricity needs by about “mining is not very efficient” he said “i’m reusing the heat i’m selfproducing so it’s almost a closed loop”haschek estimates his mining operation would be profitable as long as eth stays above about  at the time of writing it is above  despite the allure of nearly free money it’s only a solution for colder months he says“it would definitely in the summer end up cooking my tomatoes on the vine” thomas smith a tech photographer and ceo of gado images told coindesk at the beginning of the pandemic smith began pumping heat from his crypto miners into a greenhouse in californiasmith’s crypto mining adventures go back several years when he decided to see if a rig could warm his home the trial was a success though he realized the variable nature of mining might be better suited to hobbyist pursuitsthomas smith recycled heat from his crypto miners to grow tomatoes gado imagesnow in a new house smith is using the radiant heat to keep his chickens happy at night “it’s a little bit easier because chicken coops have to be pretty well ventilated so you’re putting the heat into the coop but it’s circulating and being vented out” chickens produce more eggs when coop temperatures reach  degrees f or sohe’s now thinking through how he might be able to automate when his rigs to turn on and off adjusting to the temperature of his home garden or coop not counting the value of his farm birds or caprese salad smith estimates he’s earned about  worth of cryptocurrenciesit’s mostly just a hobby that helps pay for itself but smith like haschek thinks it could provide a path forward for others looking to help secure cryptocurrency networks without adding to their climate guiltof course these efforts are small and nowhere near significant to counterbalance the larger geopolitical forces at play in corporate crypto mining but it’s a startand it couldn’t come at a better time with bitcoin’s price going parabolic alarm over the network’s consumption has never been sharper projects like  in texas which is making use of excess renewable energy production in west texas as well as the numerous hydropowered mining farms across the us canada and china are doing little to improve bitcoin’s image“even if i scale this up as much as i could as one individual it’s not going to take me super far but if a lot of people take these ideas and apply them at a larger scale that could start to have a major impact on how much electricity and carbon emissions come out of these technologies” smith saideven neophytes such as melissa girard from le caveau who only lets the machines run while she tends to the plants could see a future in crypto
