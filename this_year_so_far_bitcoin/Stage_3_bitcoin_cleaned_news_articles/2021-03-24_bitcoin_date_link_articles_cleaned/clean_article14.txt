bridgewater associates founder ray dalio joins influencers with andy serwer to share his thoughts on bitcoin and cryptocurrenciesvideo transcriptandy serwer bitcoin i mean so its a twopart question is that in a bubble maybe threepart question is it dangerous and what do you think the likelihood of the government outlawing it is and is that even feasibleray dalio bitcoin has proven itself over the last  years it proved it hasnt been hacked its by and large therefore worked on an operational basis it has built a significant following it is an alternative in a sense storehold of wealth its like a digital cash and those are the pluses bubbles are financial assets that have imputed value its an asset that doesnt have intrinsic value it has imputed value its whatever we think it isand if you look at some of the bubbles in the past a great book is extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of the crowds by mackay  or something but he talks about the south sea bubble and he talks about the mississippi bubble and so on it is when people love it its the dot com bubble and so on and it that you know that could be so when you look at bitcoin its a possibility you know its an alternative because there arent many such assets there are not so many assets that might have intrinsic value that cant be messed aroundas far as the government allowing it the history was you know banks always used to exist and then with the bank of england they decided that it was in their interest to have a monopoly on banking at a country and so what we did is every country treasures its monopoly on controlling the supply and demand they dont want other monies to be operating or competing because things can get out of controlso i think that it would be very likely that you will have it under a certain set of circumstances outlawed the way gold was outlawed and youre watching that question arise in india today india today is making the move to outlaw it outlaw possession of it ok so we have to see what that meansnow can they do it now we get into the particulars my understanding from people who are sort of in government surveillance and so on is yes its a they can understand they can track it they can know whos dealing with it i dont know like im not an expert on that but you know theres a whole way is it private wallets is it not private wallets how do you do this this and the other thing i would suspect it would be very hard to hold up against that kind of action so thats what it looks like to me
