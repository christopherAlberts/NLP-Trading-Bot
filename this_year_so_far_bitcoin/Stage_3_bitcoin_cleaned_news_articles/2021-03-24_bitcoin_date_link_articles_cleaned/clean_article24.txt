bitcoin in contango how pricing differences can foreshadow further gainsmajor differences in the spot price for bitcoin and the cost of buying the cryptocurrency in the futures market create unique opportunities for traders several factors may be behind this development but it could be bullish for the bitcoin price outlook no matter the catalystcurious developments could highlight supply shortage or heightened derivatives demandas bitcoin gradually matures and the ecosystem surrounding it expands further the original cryptocurrency is increasingly behaving like a commodity thanks to a robust futures market that continues to grow derivatives contracts on bitcoin also gain popularity and meaningfully impact its pricing structurethis has resulted in a unique development that has unfolded over the last several months known as “contango” bitcoin futures contracts to be settled months down the road are trading at a significant premium to spot prices this delivers a serious arbitrage opportunity that could temporarily result in relatively high returns with minimal riskcontango explainedin more traditional financial markets primarily for commodity futures contracts the future pricing structure can vary dramatically compared to that commodity’s spot price one of the most common examples of contango involves oil prices let’s say that spot oil is trading at  a barrel and a contract due in three months is trading at  a barrelthis  delta the difference between the futures price and spot price represents a chance for traders to capture most of that  delta by selling shorting the futures contract at  a barrel and buying oil in the spot market for  a barrel simultaneously futures prices are higher than spot prices can be attributed to several factors but this pricing scenario is called “contango”for instance some market analysts may believe that future demand will be higher than current demand resulting in traders pushing up prices in the future compared to today’s prices in other cases analysts may believe that supply is set to fall in the future creating a shortage that can also cause costs to rise in the future relative to the presentother factors influence contango trades and diminish their profitability in traditional markets among them being storage costs in the oil example selling futures contracts might require the seller to physically deliver the oil to the buyer at contract settlement in the case of contango it would require a trader to take physical possession of the oil bought in the spot market today to deliver against the short futures contract set to expire in a few monthsthis means the trader must store the oil over that period to capture the price differential creating costs that eat away at the  difference between spot and futures prices however unlike oil other energy commodities metals or agricultural products bitcoin has no storage costs whether we are discussing  bitcoin to  bitcoinsa riskfree cryptocurrency tradebitcoin futures turnover accounts for a significant amount of daily cryptocurrency volume according to skew’s figures futures volume surpassed  billion almost every day for the last four weeks after reaching a whopping  billion on february concerning contango futures prices are trading steeply above spot prices in some instances to the tune of  to  this presents a nearly riskfree trading opportunity for traders with access to futures contracts and spot pricessuppose a trader can buy bitcoin in the spot market and sell in the futures market for a contract that expires in three or six months simultaneously in that case they can easily capture that percentage difference when the trade is unwound during contract settlement the day the contract expires and is settled in cryptocurrency or fiatwhile it’s hard to define any trade as entirely riskfree this transaction when done repeatedly can result in significant returns without having to necessarily expose an investment portfolio to the volatility present in bitcoin by buying in one market and selling in another the trader is effectively hedged and can capture the differencereasons for contangocontango has already defined bitcoin pricing for a considerable period and could continue but how long remains the chief question on traders’ minds the reasons attributed to this pricing differential are numerous but it’s hard to pin down one exact catalyst given the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency and lack of datasome market participants and analysts have pointed to the recent accumulation by corporations including tesla microstrategy and grayscale bitcoin trust demand as one factor behind a shortage that has helped push prices higher if accompanied by miners “hodling” bitcoin in the hopes of further price increases due to the lower mining rewards precipitated by the halving it could also result in a significant supply shortageif there is a supply shortage in the spot market that makes bitcoin challenging to purchase some investors may be buying at a premium in the futures market driving up futures prices moreover as futures trading gains more popularity collateralization of futures contracts with bitcoin itself could also influence prices collateral which is effectively an asset that fiat money or cryptocurrency are borrowed against serves as traders’ financial guarantee when they open a positionby locking up crypto as collateral and using this collateral to buy futures contracts with leverage these two factors in tandem could be driving prices higher however the emergence of contango itself could also be a factor suppose traders see this disparity and rush to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity in that case they could be buying up bitcoin in bulk in the spot market and selling an equivalent amount in the futures market this scenario could generate a selffulfilling shortage whereby prices continue to risehowever arbitrage opportunities typically do not last over a long time horizon as more market participants enter the trade there is the possibility that the delta difference between spot and futures prices will narrow significantly ending the high profitability that currently characterizes the tradestill given the possibility of a serious shortage of coins hesitant miners more significant corporate accumulation and higher participation in the bitcoin derivatives market this specific pricing scenario could persist for the foreseeable future because of bitcoin’s finite supply parameters and booming demand the situation is ripe for scarcity which could elevate prices indefinitelydo you think that due to the current market forces explained here bitcoin’s price will indeed continue to rise indefinitely let us know in the comments section
