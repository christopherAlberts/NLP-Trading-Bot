march    min readopinions expressed by entrepreneur contributors are their ownwhen you buy bitcoin and sell it for a profit you are subject to capitalgains taxes this is the case whether you buy bitcoin and sell it for dollars or whether you exchange it for other cryptocurrency for a profit this is also the case if you buy bitcoin it goes up in value and then you exchange the bitcoin for goods or servicesthe irs has given guidance twice on cryptocurrency tax issues in irs revenue ruling  and  the critical determination by the irs in  was that cryptocurrency is property not currency for federal tax purposes this critical determination meant that cryptotrading profits will be treated similar to stocktrading profits as stock and crypto are both considered property for tax purposes treating crypto profits like stock seems straight forward enough but the rules are not so clear for bitcoin and other cryptocurrency since crypto can be purchased with dollars go up or down in value and then be exchanged to buy a tesla pizza or even withdrawn for cash at a bitcoin atm these exchange outcomes are not common in stock trading and as a result the rules for crypto taxation are confoundingrelated  things you should know about cryptocurrency taxestrading of crypto and shortterm vs longterm gainslike a stock portfolio that you personally own you will need to track the value of the crypto you buy and then you’ll also need to track the value of crypto when it is sold or exchanged for example if you bought bitcoin for  and then sold it in exchange for  youll have a gain of  this gain is subject to tax at either short or longterm capitalgains rates depending on how long you held the bitcoin if you held the bitcoin for more than one year you get preferred longterm capitalgains rates of  essentially the longterm capitalgains tax rate is  for low to middleincome earners generally less than  if single  for married couples is  for middle to highincome earners generally income up to  if single  for married couples and is  for highincome earners generally income in excess of  if single  for married couplesif you held the bitcoin or other cryptocurrency for a year or less then you are subject to shortterm capitalgains rates which vary from  based on your modified adjusted gross incomeexchanging one crypto for anotherthe exchange of one cryptocurrency for another causes taxable gain for example if you bought  of bitcoin one month and then exchanged it for ethereum later worth  then you have a taxable gain of  this is the case whether you held the bitcoin for one minute and traded it for other cryptocurrency or whether it was held for yearsusing crypto for goods or serviceswhen you exchange cryptocurrency for goods or services you are taxed on the increase in value that cryptocurrency has from the time of purchase until the time it is exchanged for example if you bought a tesla with  worth of bitcoin you would need to track when that  in bitcoin was purchased and you would then pay tax on the increase if that bitcoin were purchased at a value of  then there would be a gain of  when that bitcoin is then exchanged for the tesla if held for over a year it will be a longterm capital gain and will be at preferred rates if the bitcoin was held a year or less the  gain will be taxed at shortterm capitalgains ratescrypto losseswhen you buy and then sell bitcoin or other cryptocurrency for a loss you are entitled to a tax loss losses can occur when selling crypto at a loss and when exchanging crypto for other cryptocurrency or goods or services at a loss losses from one crypto trade or exchange can be used to offset other crypto gains shortterm crypto losses can offset shortterm crypto gains and longterm crypto losses can be used to offset longterm crypto gains crypto losses can also potentially be used to offset gains from stock or mutual funds if crypto losses exceed crypto gains as well as stock etf and mutual fund gains then up to  of the loss can be used to offset other income such as wages or selfemployment income any losses that cannot fully be used against income in the year incurred can be carried forward to future years and netted against future crypto or stocktrading gainscrypto forks and airdropsirs guidance in  clarified two unique items that can occur on a crypto blockchain the first is a fork there are different kinds of forks that may occur and what crypto owners need to know for tax purposes is that if a new coin result from a hard fork those new coins are considered taxable as ordinary income to the recipient the irs also clarified in  that an airdrop of new coins to existing cryptocurrency holders will be taxable as ordinary income to the recipient at regular incometax rates airdrops are distributions of free coins or tokens to current cryptocurrency holders and are usually promotionalcrypto mining and staking is ordinary income taxed at regular ratescryptocurrency mining and staking income is ordinary income for tax purposes cryptocurrency mining and its staking counterpart is a service that computers provide to a cryptocurrency blockchain network the owners of these computers typically receive cryptocurrency from the network in exchange for their services so for example if i owned computers that provided cryptocurrency mining or staking then i would typically receive crypto in exchange for these services and would pay tax on that crypto to the irs the payment in crypto is taxable income just the same as if i were paid in dollars to perform these same services to the networkthe value of the crypto when it is received is the value to be used for taxreporting purposes if the value of the crypto increases after its received then you will pay capitalgains tax on the increase of value when the crypto is later sold or exchanged so for example lets say you received bitcoin worth  for cryptomining services and that this crypto then increased in value and three months later was sold and traded for  the first  would be taxable as ordinary income this income will be subject to regular incometax rates which range from  the  increase in value in the bitcoin after it was earned will be treated as capitalgain incomerecord keeping and reporting is requiredthe taxation of cryptocurrency is complicated and requires diligent recordkeeping when buying selling or exchanging the responsibility to properly report this is on the crypto owner there are numerous cryptocurrencytracking applications that have been created to help cryptocurrency investors users and traders properly track and report their taxes cryptotradertax and cointrackerio are lading providers to investigate there are around  companies that have an application to assist in tracking your crypto for tax purposesthe irs requires the reporting of cryptocurrency gains and losses on form  form  is filed with your personal  tax return the major providers of crypto in the us report crypto transactions and trading to the irs this includes coinbase gemini kraken cash app paypal and binanceus whether the exchange you used reports to the irs or not you still have a reporting obligationbut do not think that you can avoid taxation by using a company outside the us you need to be wary as this can result in additional foreign asset reporting requirements to the irs for example the foreign bank account rules known as fbar have a pending rule change that would include crypto holdings to fall under the definition of a bank account and would thus result in foreign bank account reporting of crypto assets additionally crypto held with a provider outside the us that exceeds  in value may also require the filing of a statement of specified foreign financial assets or form  in sum do not assume that trading and holding crypto abroad will exempt you from taxreporting obligations in fact it makes it more complicated and it does not reduce your tax obligationsrelated cryptocurrency and taxes what you need to knowusing an ira to defer or obtain taxfree gains on crypto profitsa roth ira can be used to invest in crypto and can grow and come out taxfree at retirement when trading crypto with a roth ira or other retirement account you can bypass the tracking and annual taxreporting as crypto profits in a roth ira or other retirement account are not subject to tax and do not show up on your  personal tax returnmany early adopters of cryptocurrency who my company worked with found the tax rules and reporting of cryptocurrency gains to be onerous and expensive these early adopters enjoyed dramatic value increases and in turn saw significant tax bills when selling or exchanging that cryptocurrency the roth ira became a particular favorite for those who perceived large gains as it allowed them to invest and own cryptocurrency where the gains can grow and come out taxfree once they reach retirement age of  ½a selfdirected roth ira is a more taxefficient option to invest or trade cryptocurrency for the long haul for those unfamiliar the income and gains made by a roth ira are not taxable and they grow and come out taxfree at retirement this is the case with stock you trade in your roth ira and it is the case with crypto that you trade in your roth ira when using a retirement account you can also skip over the annual tax reporting on your  given that the income in a retirement account is exempt from capitalgains taxesin additional to roth iras you can also use traditional iras hsas solo  and other retirement accounts to invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies keep in mind that traditional iras and  accounts are subject to tax on the distributions from those accounts at retirement but are not subject to tax yeartoyear and grow taxdeferred until you take distributions from the accountit is important to realize that the funds in a roth ira or other retirement account cannot be withdrawn until the account owner reaches  ½ if the account owner takes a distribution of the gains on a roth ira before the owner reaches age  ½ they will be subject to early withdrawal penalties and taxes on the investment gains withdrawnthe usual broker dealers who provide retirement accounts do not allow you to invest and trade cryptocurrency in their iras and roth iras instead you will need to use a retirement account custodian who provides selfdirected accounts this is what my company and about  other companies in the so called selfdirected ira industry provide these companies allow you to invest in real estate private companies and some allow for cryptocurrency when choosing a provider for a crypto ira or crypto roth ira watch out for significant trading fees make sure they are licensed and ensure that you are comfortable with
