the fact that bitcoin is trading in contango presents a remarkable investment opportunity and suggests hyperbitcoinization but what is itbitcoin is trading in contango but what does this mean“contango is a situation where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the spot price” investopedianow what’s a futures contract“a futures contract is a legal agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity asset or security at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future” investopediacurrently the spot price market price for bitcoin on exchanges trades lower than futures prices the spread for the june futures contract is more than  percent annualized on most major exchangesthis means that anyone can buy bitcoin and use that bitcoin as collateral to sell the june futures contract this trade locks in a riskfree  percent usddenominated return more than  percent annualized no matter where the price of bitcoin goes over the following monthsthe only risk is exchange custody losing coins due to poor management or hackswhy does this “free” money existthe contango exists due to how profitable it is to leverage long bitcoin and the amount of capital willing to go leverage long versus leverage shortalmost everyone goes leverage long on bitcoin in two wayslong perpetual swaps long forward futures contractscurrently there is  billion in open interest on perpetual swaps and futures so there is a significant amount of capital and liquidityif you go long on the perpetual swap you are charged a funding rate every eight hours this funding rate is set by the market to ensure the perpetual futures price stays near the index spot price in a way it is basically a futures contract that is only eight hours in duration and it always rolls overover the last month the perpetual swap has been averaging around  percent every eight hours or  percent daily or  percent annually this funding rate is the longs paying the shorts because more capital is naturally going to be long bitcoin especially when the price is going upso if you want to go leverage long for an extended amount of time and the perpetual swap funding rate is high then you’re much better off going leverage long on a futures contract that may only be trading at a  percent annualized premiumbut again just like the swap market not many investors want to leverage shortforward futures contracts a large portion of the capital that is short bitcoin is likely doing the basis arbitrage tradewhat are the implicationsit’s possible that bitcoin’s contango has created a super massive black holethe evergrowing bitcoin black holebitcoin is the world’s best monetary good designed to go up forever market participants buy and the price goes up price going up attracts more buyers with leverage leverage buyers drive up the contango spread usd arbitrageurs attempt to capture the riskfree return to capture the spread they buy bitcoin and sell futures buying bitcoin causes the price to go up further price going up increases the contango spread attracting more arbitrageurs investor recognize this feedback loop exists and just buy bitcoin to hodl repeat for all market participants until hyperbitcoinizationwhy has this not been arbitraged outthe bitcoin contango basis trade is adding gas to the fire as more and more capital begins to recognize this opportunity the price of bitcoin will continue to increasethere are a few possible explanations for why this spread hasn’t been arbitraged out since a truly “efficient” market would likely eat up any “risk free”  percent yield opportunitiesone possibility is that the only people in the bitcoin industry who have both a good understanding and the capital to move markets recognize that in order for the spread to be potentially closed there must be billions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin purchased if there’s an incentive to purchase billions of dollars’ of bitcoin and you know bitcoin is the world’s hardest monetary good you likely aren’t going to accept the “riskfree” more than  percent because you know bitcoin will outperform that over the long runthe second possibility is simply that the  trillionplus of excess capital invested in bonds stocks and real estate is held by investors who don’t know that the futures arbitrage trade exists or they don’t feel comfortable deploying capital in the space yetthe last possibility is that the riskfree spread could represent a truly marketbased “riskfree” rate of return since bond yields have been manipulated lower and lower over the previous decades this more than  percent could be the markets way of saying it expects stocks real estate and other assets to perform in line with this plus a small risk premium this high expected nominal return could be possible due to the endless fiscal spending by governments financed by the dovish monetary policies of central bankswhat could break the contangobitcoin only going up sounds great on paper but what could eliminate the futures contangosince the futures contango is driven by more money wanting to leverage long than leverage short this dynamic would need to flip meaning more capital would need to be going leverage short than leverage long for bitcoin to switch from contango to backwardationwith the macro money printing backdrop finite bitcoin supply and a growing number of bitcoin yield and lending products there is little reason to expect this to occur at least anytime soonwith that said there are a few potential scenarios where bitcoin’s contango breaks and turns into backwardationone old hodlers could start selling in size this may not happen due to a growing number of financial products that make it easy to use bitcoin without selling ittwo people could read too deeply into ’s  and  models if bitcoin’s price overshoots the models some may consider selling in order to buy back lower while this would be very risky especially in the current macro environment if enough market participants do it it could become self fulfillinglast a drastic change in monetaryfiscal policy could temporarily break the contango for example during the march  crash when the money printer wasn’t going brrr fast enough bitcoin went into backwardationis this hyperbitcoinizationwe are not sure would we feel comfortable selling a significant amount of bitcoin at any priceabsolutely notthis is a guest post by
