our perception of money is expanding the way humans think about money understand it discuss it and interact with it is changing as an inverse to previous regressions in freedom like the transition from the gold standard to the fiat standard we now progress to the inevitably more advanced money of modernityin a world with the internet fiat money is obsolete instantaneous global value transfer is not only a necessity but now a reality an immutable deflationary computer program taking over the global monetary system should be expected if humans want to get to mars they need bitcoinwhile our perception of money expands the aperture of money contractsas we come from a century of financialization across the globe we have an excess of monetary light present monetary light as this essay defines it is simply the excess energy spent on this financialization of the global economy what bitcoin does is focus this light through an evercontracting aperture slowly directing this vast energy of value onto a single focus pointit is still early on in this process as william clemente iii illustrated so beautifully for bitcoin magazine bitcoin is going to compress quadrillions of monetary energy into just  million btc the reality shift necessary for this to happen will be dramatic and indeed entirely unpredictablethe future will happen according to the actions of individuals and the impact of those actions will decide the direction that bitcoin goes this shift will most likely manifest itself as major changes in the traditional finance industrybut regardless of how it looks the focusing of monetary energy via bitcoin will surely happen much along the same lines as the black hole analogy it suffices to say that bitcoin is extremely effective at gathering energy upon a single point once this energy is focused on this point it would be reasonable to expect an excitation of the point itself — like a fire being lit by a magnifying glass the concentration of monetary energy into bitcoin will ignite innovation within the bitcoin network further attracting and consuming more monetary energythis positive feedback loop will be inextinguishable and is already at work it is what allows me and so many others to contribute to this magazine with bitcoin you are rewarded for contributing to the strengthening of the network which in turn enhances the rewardthe earliest of bitcoiners know this as evidenced by their wealth accumulation throughout years of working in the space what goes around comes around and when you start sending hard work into the bitcoin universe bitcoin comes back to you and when you understand the scarcity of that bitcoin you treasure itwe can modify this analogy bitcoin is an aperture fixing the energy of technological progress upon moneybitcoin is the natural result of human progress the internet’s invention the creation of an interconnecting virtual reality which is free to be shaped by the user was the precursor to a form of money built on these ideals satoshi nakamoto created an interconnecting virtual reality of money by creating a fixed technology which allowed the market price and industry to be free to be shaped by the user“the nature of bitcoin is such that once version  was released the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime” satoshi nakamototo reiterate its actually the rigidity of bitcoin which enables it to be shaped by the users of the network this isn’t unlike the protocols which enable the internet as we know it to exist consensus is necessary for interconnecting virtual realitieswhen bitcoin was created the technological progress which enabled the internet was shifted in focus to money even if only by a small amount as the network has grown absorbed brain power from other industries and therefore the time and output of fantastic individuals so the aperture of this technological progress has been further focused upon moneythe existence of the network entirely reliant upon users is now bolstered by all of the work being done on it in addition the built layers that exist on the network serve as applications and uses for bitcoin and further bolster the networka product of human ingenuity bitcoin’s network finds its foundations in the same technological innovation which serves as implementation of the grandscale economic transformation that bitcoin necessitates that is the work that built bitcoin originally is now being applied to creating access to bitcoin for the whole worldas we haven’t witnessed anything like bitcoin before the potential of it is yet to be known i for one excitedly await to see what human progress generates next
