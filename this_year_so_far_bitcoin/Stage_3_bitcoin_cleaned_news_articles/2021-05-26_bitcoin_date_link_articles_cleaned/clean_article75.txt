the biden administration lawmakers and central bankers are wrestling with fresh challenges posed by cryptocurrency conferring in numerous meetings amid recent volatility in these digital assetswhite house officials were briefed by career staff at the treasury department about the risks posed by cryptocurrencies earlier this month two people familiar with the matter said the issue has also been raised in conversations with federal regulators involving treasury’s office of the comptroller of the currency and the consumer financial protection bureau although those discussions did not involve principallevel officials such as treasury secretary janet yellenadministration officials are studying potential “gaps” in oversight related to the crypto market such as whether it can be used to finance illicit or terrorist activities the people said they have also discussed whether some protections are needed for average retail investors purchasing cryptocurrencies the white house and department of treasury are also publicly backing a new plan to target cryptocurrencies as part of a broader effort to address tax avoidancefor now federal regulators do not currently see the wild swings in the crypto markets as likely to pose a threat to the broader stability of financial markets though they believe the risks are worth monitoring the people said administration officials are discussing whether there are guardrails on cryptocurrencies that can be imposed while still allowing investors to “dogecoin to their heart’s content” as one person briefed on the matter said referring to trades of a popular cryptocurrency based on a meme of a dog“they’re aware of the fact that there are all kinds of risks in the abstract and things to look out for but they are still largely in a waitandsee posture” one person briefed on the matter said the people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private government reviewspokespeople for the white house department of treasury and cfpb declined to commentat the same time both central bank officials and congressional lawmakers have talked increasingly about policies that stand to dramatically alter crypto markets the house has passed and sent the senate bipartisan legislation instructing federal regulators to study and clarify rules for cryptocurrencies lael brainard a member of the federal reserve’s board of governors published an article on monday highlighting the potential benefits of a digital currency created and managed by the central bank a governmentrun digital currency could cut into cryptocurrency’s market share by offering a safer alternative to instantaneous digital transactionsparticularly high levels of volatility in the cryptocurrency markets have rattled investors and highlighted to policymakers the potential dangers of the freewheeling sector bitcoin the most popular cryptocurrency crashed by more than  per cent from its prior peaks amid a broader crypto selloff dogecoin fell by more than  per cent before paring back its losses the crypto markets appear to have been rattled by elon musk saying tesla would no longer accept bitcoin as a payment for vehicle as well as chinese officials suggesting new restrictions on financial firms tied to cryptocurrenciesthe recent market instability has compounded existing concerns about cryptocurrencies including fears about the environmental impact created by things like bitcoin mining government officials also believe these cryptocurrencies make it easier for criminals to transfer money without detection the market cap for cryptocurrencies topped  trillion £ trillion for the first time this april just a few months after it hit  trillion £“cryptos are becoming a larger segment of the financial system and regulators should be concerned about how this market intersects with our financial regulatory framework as banks and other financial institutions become more entwined with it” said gregg gelzinis a banking expert at the centre for american progress a centreleft think tankdigital currencies operating have posed a conundrum for policymakers for years they are hard to regulate in part because they are not controlled by conventional trading institutions such as banks or other typical financial firmscryptocurrencies drew less scrutiny when they first emerged their prominence was accelerated during the pandemic when hundreds of billions of federal dollars pumped directly to consumers spurred casual investors to explore novel financial instruments institutional players including some fortune  companies also got involved leading to their further proliferationthe amount of energy required to “mine” various cryptocurrencies has alarmed environmentalists with bitcoin mining alone consuming more electricity than entire countries according to the cambridge centre for alternative finance “that is a staggeringly large number for something that is absolutely useless” said eswar prasad an economist at cornell university “it’s an environmental disaster”these fears have grown just as political realities make cryptocurrencies harder to stamp out industry groups say that as many as  million americans currently own cryptocurrencies as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies grow in size and scope they become more difficult to manage because more people have bought into the system who stand to be affected by a crackdown“i wish we had smothered this a decade ago before it grew into a  trillion monster” said jason furman a senior economist in the obama administration “digital currencies are all cons and no pros — environment crime volatility taking advantage of unaware investors if they had any use at all we could debate it but they don’t have any use at all”the extent of crypto’s rise has complicated a straightforward policy response though several proposals have either emerged or are seen as likely for instance the department of treasury last week unveiled a plan to require cryptocurrency companies to provide the irs with more financial information the reporting requirements would hit firms receiving cryptocurrency with a fair market value of more than  £ that measure is tied up with the biden administration’s broader tax and spending proposals complicating its path toward passage“if you increase third party reporting for currency transactions it will help significantly with tax compliance and thats what treasury is proposing” said john koskinen who served as irs commissioner under the last two administrations “it would make a difference the statistics are clear the more thirdparty information the irs has the higher the rate of compliance”the securities and exchange commission may also push for changes in his first public hearing sec chairman gary gensler said earlier this month that congress should do more to clarify the rules over cryptocurrencies while also acknowledging that the sec was limited in what it could do the increased risk of regulation in the past month has led some cryptocurrency investors to sellconstance hunter chief economist at kpmg said “regulation is what allows lay people to trust a variety of things theyre not experts in  whether that be medicine or financial markets  but the fact that it crashed on the idea regulators are looking at it is a huge red flag in terms of its intrinsic value”federal reserve officials are also exploring the potential advantages of a governmentmanaged “digital dollar” central banks across the globe have begun studying whether to issue their own digital currencies primarily in response to concerns that tech companies would ramp up their own private payment systems such as facebook’s diem formerly known as libra but the development could have implications for cryptocurrencies as well bob hockett a former fed official now at cornell university said he has discussed with treasury officials and other banking regulators the possibility for the us to launch a digital currency system that could ultimately undercut cryptos cryptocurrencies get their name in part because the payments are encrypted in a way that makes them avoid detection a technique that could be mimicked by central bankshockett added that creating a digital currency system accessible to every american would allow policymakers to deposit funds in taxpayer bank accounts while reducing the transaction fees currently collected by private companies as many as one quarter of all americans are unbanked or underbanked  which inhibited federal stimulus payments during the pandemic — whereas only  per cent of americans do not have access to a smartphone“people use crypto for many reasons but some of the things those people are looking for could be provided by the central bank such as the ease and speed of transaction that are secure and consistent” hockett said “there’s no reason we couldn’t from the point of the individual user allow transactions without fees and it could make for a much smoother and easier functioning monetary policy”john fagan who was director of the us treasury’s markets room and now principal of markets policy partners said the biden administration is likely to look at cryptocurrency issues with an eye toward problems caused by money laundering tax evasion and investor protection treasury would likely to focus on the first two while the third would fall the securities and exchange commission“what we’ve been telling our clients for months is the cryptocurrency complex is not fully pricing in the kind of regulatory attention likely bought to bear on bitcoin and the other operators” fagan said “this ‘constructive ambiguity’ kind of regulatory structure will be replaced by a lot more bright lines”still adam ozimek chief economist at upwork said he thought cryptocurrencies may not be a safe investment but do not appear to represent a broader threat to the economy many experts and crypto industry groups warn of the dangers of government overreach“i don’t think this is something regulators should be concerned about even if people putting their savings into it certainly should be” ozimek said “it’s a really risky speculative investment  but should regulators be concerned about the price of art that goes up and down rapidly too”the washington post
