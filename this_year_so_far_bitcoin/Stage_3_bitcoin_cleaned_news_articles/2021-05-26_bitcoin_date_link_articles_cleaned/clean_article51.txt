this might seem like a challenging time to own a piece of the cryptocurrency market bitcoin cryptobtc and many of its peers have come under fire for their toll on resources in the mining process regulators worldwide are starting to clamp down on digital currencies speculators are bailing on cryptoprices have been tumbling over the past month for bitcoin and ethereum cryptoeth but i continue to dedicate a small portion of my overall portfolio to crypto i own a little ethereum directly with smaller positions in a couple of other crypto denominations but my exposure to cryptocurrency stems largely from my ownership of grayscale bitcoin trust otcgbtc and grayscale ethereum trust otcethe let me go over some of the reasons i have gone this route they are trading at big discountscryptocurrency might be the riskiest asset class you can own these days but it helps that the two largest grayscale trusts are currently fetching historically wide discounts to the crypto theyre holding every share of grayscale bitcoin trust was backed by  in coldstored bitcoin tokens as of tuesdays close the trust closed at  a  discount to its net asset valuegrayscale ethereum trust has a smaller markdown but its still a discount the singleasset trust closed at  on tuesday  less than the  a share in ethereum that it currently ownsboth trusts traded at premiums  sometimes significant markups  until just a couple of months ago there is no guarantee that either trust will return to trading at a premium buying bitcoin for  on the dollar doesnt mean you can swap it out for a buck on the way out but it definitely makes the decision that much easier to justify high management fees arent a deal breakerthe loudest knocks on the two trusts are the high fees associated with ownership grayscale bitcoin trust charges a  annual management fee grayscale ethereum trust will set you back  a year like mutual funds and etfs these fees are nibbled away over the course of the year in this case coming at the expense of how much crypto is backed by each sharethe average equity mutual fund and etf charge  and  respectively in annual expenses the expense ratios are much lower for index funds in those categories ill admit that i also flinched when i initially started buying grayscale bitcoin trust in the fall of last year and that was at a slight premium to its net asset value however it was an easier decision to make when i considered trading costsif youre going to buy and hold crypto for a long time its certainly reasonable to buy directly there are a growing number of trading platforms that make the process seamless however unlike exchangetraded investments including grayscale bitcoin trust and grayscale ethereum trust that can be freely bought and sold through brokers charging zero commissions the same doesnt hold true for crypto itselfit can cost as much as  of your investment to buy or sell bitcoin and ethereum directly through leading cryptocurrency marketplace coinbase nasdaqcoin a  annual fee is still higher if you plan to own your stake for a little more than a year but there are a lot of itchy trigger fingers when it comes to crypto the typical time that coinbase investors hold bitcoin is just  days the average holding period on coinbase for ethereum is just  days suddenly commissionfree trading of the trusts doesnt seem that expensive im not alonegrayscale might not be a household name outside of the cryptocurrency universe but both of these trusts are huge grayscale ethereum trust has  billion in assets under management the much larger grayscale bitcoin trust weighs in at nearly  billion in assetsthe convenience of exchangetraded access to a pure crypto play is significant its easy to buy crypto directly these days but your options are limited if you want the appreciation to take place in a taxdeferred retirement account going this route would also make sense if you want to keep your crypto in the same mainstream brokerage portfolio as the rest of your investmentscathie wood is also an investor here grayscale bitcoin trust is one of the largest holdings of ark next generation internet etf nysemktarkw accounting for more than  of the futurelooking fund
