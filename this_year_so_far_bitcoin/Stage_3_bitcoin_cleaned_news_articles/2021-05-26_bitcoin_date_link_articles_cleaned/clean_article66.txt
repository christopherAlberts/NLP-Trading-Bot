while working as a vice president managing walmarts chinese ecommerce service one day he got a phone call from his brother a software engineer at google who told lee about an exciting esoteric new idea called bitcoinbitcoin had been around for only two years by then and the circle of people who knew about it was still relatively small fascinated lee built his own mining rig and began to learn more about the cryptocurrency by  lee had quit his job at walmart and made bitcoin his fulltime career mining it at home and trading for it on an exchange website called btcchinacom later known as btcc the site was easy to use but clearly needed a coders touch and lee with his background managing consumerfacing ecommerce sites knew he could help he saidlee contacted the two owners of btcc and met them for dinner dinner turned into latenight coffee as the three exchanged ideas and discussed the future of bitcoin and it became clear that lees expertise could take the fledgling site to the next level over the coming months lee bought shares of btcc took on the mantle of ceo and helped lead the exchange through half a decade of growth eventually btcc would become the longestrunning cryptocurrency exchangeat the time lee became ceo bitcoin was worth in january  btcc was acquired by a hong kong blockchain investment fund only a month earlier bitcoin had reached what was then an alltime high of  — and considering bitcoin had begun  at barely over  it was the end to an impressive run for the cryptocurrencyas it turns out that was indeed the end to bitcoins run and by december  the cryptocurrency was back down to  lee was able to sell at the top of the market and walk away splitting his focus between starting up a cryptowallet company called ballet and writing his bookthat book the promise of bitcoin the future of money and how it can work for you hit shelves this week and the timing couldnt be better this month marks lees  anniversary of getting involved in the world of bitcoin and the cryptocurrency has found a new place in the financial zeitgeist that even lee couldnt have predicteddont be scared off by volatilitynowadays bitcoins  rise and subsequent fall the following year almost seems antiquated in the past year and a half bitcoin has reached shocking highs and plummeted to devastating lows that might scare away wouldbe investors but lee believes thats the exact opposite of what you should doif you have some inklings to buy bitcoin this is certainly a good time because this is a price correction lee saidwhile all eyes are on bitcoins price lee believes that most people dont really think about their investments in terms of facts and figures he said instead they let emotions like fear cloud their judgement and corrode their logicsome people always say i would have waited for the price to go down a little bit before i buy well mathematically and financially that makes sense lee said but it doesnt make sense emotionally because a lot of times when the price goes down people lose emotional interestlee said that in conversations with friends last month he was asked if they should buy bitcoin at  he said yes but his friends demurred believing that  was too expensive but now that bitcoin costs  its much cheaper yet those same friends have been scared off by the volatility and are no longer interested in buyingthe best time to buy bitcoin is always now in the sense that whenever you have the most conviction whenever you have the most willpower to do it he said you dont know whats going to happen right the price could go up it could go down you could lose your interest you could lose your convictionthe problem lee said is that people equate volatility with risk they look at the high volatility of bitcoin over the past month and believe that means the cryptocurrency is a risky investment but according to lee thats the wrong way to look at itpeople have a bad connotation with risk but at the same time if the volatility and the expected return is high then its worth the risk while lee acknowledged that bitcoin was down by  in the past week he pointed out that bitcoin had risen by  times over the past yearsome of the most famous investors such as warren buffett have decried bitcoin as risky and even worthless — and buffetts righthand man charlie munger went so far as to call bitcoin disgusting and contrary to the interest of civilization meanwhile other bigname investors are growing more bullish on bitcoin with ray dalio recently announcing hed rather own bitcoin than a bondclearly opinions are divided but lee said the key to making a decision about the cryptocurrency was to learn as much about bitcoin as you could according to lee only by better understanding bitcoin can you see what a game changer the cryptocurrency is which will in turn give you a longerterm perspective and allow you to ignore the shortterm volatilityyou have to spend time to learn about bitcoin the technology the engineering the economics aspect of it the philosophy the politics aspect of it he said when youve really learned that then it starts to all starts to make sense
