first moves julia chatterley spoke to fred thiel ceo of marathon digital holdings wednesday where he spoke about the call mining and climate and where bitcoin prices might gocan you tell us what happened on that call and perhaps what role elon musk played toothiel i think the calls purpose really was to help elon understand really how power is used by the bitcoin mining industry and the bitcoin mining industrys commitment to using carbonneutral power overall our footprint will be  carbon neutral so were excited to come out and be able to move a majority of our fleet to carbon neutral and looking forward over the course of next year to reach  overalldo you think he was confused about what you guys do and what the implications of what you do beforehandthiel no hes a very intelligent man obviously i dont think he was confused i think it is just a question of having the right data at your fingertips there is a lot of conflicting data out there the industry is moved or is moving towards  carbonneutral or renewable energy sources outside of china the majority of the energy being consumed is moving more towards carbon neutral in the bitcoin industry one of the reasons for the formation of this group is to be transparent about energy use to educate the marketplace about how bitcoin mining is really an energy consumer of last resort how we use a lot of energy that otherwise would be wasted bitcoin miners dont consume huge amounts of energy harmful for the environment a lot are carbon neutral as we continue to move towards carbon neutrality we will be an enabler for the industry that provides renewable energy to try new technologies part of the meeting was also to try and chat with elon about what to do to make the industry more reliablewhat do you think he can do to help the industrythiel well solar city is part of tesla tsla well solar city is part of solar power generation is something that is a technology they have tesla has huge experience in utility scaled battery storage which is critical to the industry so i think he clearly has access to technologies that would be helpful and i think that the industry would love to work with him to try to bring those technologies to greater use especially for bitcoin miningwhat can you think happens to mining in china do you think we see a more significant crackdownthiel well i think well i think were already starting to see it  miners in china are starting to either decommission certain mining operations and try and move their operations outside of china and beyond the arm of the chinese authorities so i think if you look at the global hash rate you will see a continued kind of lowering of it to a certain extent over time until those miners are able to transitiondoes the price of bitcoin matter to your investment plans do you have a forecast of where you see bitcoin prices goingthiel i think as you look at bitcoin mining it is the ultimate scarce resource there is and ever will be only  million bitcoins available today we have about  million that have been mined a certain percentage of those have been lost in wallets where people dont have the keys to them anymore and there are only currently  bitcoin made per day or rewarded per day to miners so the industry is really focused on the more the price of bitcoin goes up the more profitable it is the more incentive people have to go into the mining business that has two effects one is the share of rewards decreases on a participant basis as the overall hash rate goes up which forces the miners to invest in more hardware more power et cetera and were very focused on maintaining our share in the marketplace we believe that where bitcoin is today is a good level and it has plenty of runway to go forward there is certainly good support at the  level so our forecast on pricing is it is in a good spot we think it will get better from an investment perspectivehow much betterthiel we continue to invest you know im not going to put a   million price out there this is a commodity in scarce supply that is still proving its mainstream nature as institutional investors come into the market as price volatility decreases the asset will become more interesting to investors maybe less to speculators were focused on bringing these revolutionary technologies like bitcoin and blockchain into the financial markets and into the financial world because there is so much that can be done today using block chain technology it really is what the internet was in the late  we believe its that level of revolutionary technology and it will have a huge impact of everybodys lives
