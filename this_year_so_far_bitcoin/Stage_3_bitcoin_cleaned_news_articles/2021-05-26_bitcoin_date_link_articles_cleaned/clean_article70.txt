in the world of crypto investments some stories seem like they might be a little bit too amazing to be true then you check them out a little bit and it turns out that they’re significantly more astonishing than you initially thought for example kyle davies and su zhu of three arrows capital they’re described in the latest profile as “former credit suisse traders” who have known each other since high school and set up a hedge fund which now owns several billion dollars’ worth of crypto assets with a strong suspicion which the principals will neither confirm or deny that a very significant proportion of the fund’s assets under management is their own personal wealthif you didn’t see the incredibly youthfullooking photos you might think that this a banking tale like that of mike novogratz – seasoned market veteran spots an opportunity and makes his fortune in fact it’s much stranger according to their respective linkedin profiles only kyle davies was actually a “trader at credit suisse” spending a bit less than three years there from  to  su zhu on the other hand did two years at etf specialists flow traders and nine months at deutsche according to his twitter he interned at cs in tokyo in  so he may have worked there too but not for long given that both men are aged  now they would have been  in  so there’s just no space for them to have had many jobs before the ones listedin other words both of the three arrows principals went through an analyst program and then left investment banking they worked on trade desks but it seems unlikely that they would have been given risk limits much larger than a dozen lattes but on the other hand the hedge fund they formed in  at the age of  has a consistent internet footprint here it is being profiled in  as an emerging markets specialist with a staff of  keeping a fund of that size going at all for nearly a decade is a definite achievement executing such a successful pivot in styles even more soeagle eyes might detect that the “high school” where the three arrows founders met was in fact phillips academy a very very elite boarding school in the usa this suggests that one or both of them has a very rich family although it’s impossible to say for sure as both surnames are very common if so it makes the story a little bit more comprehensible to presume that the main investor is family money without that we’d be struggling to understand how two twenty five year olds with only a few years’ sell side experience were able to raise a fund big enough to cover its operating costs at that kind of scaledavies and zhu have apparently “resisted talking about their fortune and recommended on social media that crypto billionaires do the same” but are happy to appear on podcasts interviews and conferences talking about favourite trades and assets however rich they were they are presumably somewhat less so than at the beginning of the week but it’s pretty likely that they’re doing better than anyone else in the  intern class at credit suisse certainly as su zhu points out if he had taken cs stock options at  they would have underperformed bitcoinelsewhere eos deal advisory was out ahead of the curve when it came to noticing that the investment banking industry’s working practices were more than a little bit unhealthy they had something of a head start founding partners maggie

alcohol abuse” despite the pandemic they’ve now managed to generate enough business to put their principles to the test when it comes to making people work long hoursand they’ve been … partially successful apparently late nights are “periodic and dealled rather than the norm” and ms kjaer says “i used to work every single weekend now its not that i work no weekends but its the exception” employees aren’t filling in time sheets and apparently there are no bonuses based on individual performance even more nervewrackingly they are giving clients short reports focused on the information
