george town cayman islands may   prnewswire  the veriblock foundation a nonprofit dedicated to promoting the development and adoption of veriblocks proofofproof速 pop速 security technology today announced a new initiative to secure dogecoin using bitcoinveriblockveriblock developers are currently working on integrating proofofproof into the dogecoin codebase and they plan to present an opensource beta to the dogecoin community soon for testing and feedback the team will also perform a public  attack on the popenabled version of dogecoin to showcase how their technology protects blockchains from the same attacks which have been used to steal over  by targeting highprofile projects including ethereum classic bitcoin gold and other projects with multibilliondollar marketcapsbitcoin has been under public fire recently for the large carbon footprint of its proofofwork mining protocol explains veriblock cofounder and chief technical officer maxwell sanchez veriblock reuses bitcoins mining power to secure the worlds blockchains amortizing the pertransaction environmental cost to levels far below what legacy financial systems provide while enabling bitcoin to easily meet the requirements demanded by many fortune  companies interested in blockchain technology as bitcoin becomes better utilized through technologies like proofofproof it has the potential to become the worlds most efficient and secure financial platform while providing solutions that transcend finance to fight police corruption enforce digital property rights and more we hope that our work can help to realize bitcoins potential as the security backbone for the digital ecosystem of tomorrowdogecoin already utilizes a shared security model by mergemining with litecoin making it a perfect candidate for veriblocks security inheritance technology sanchez noted mergemining has several critical security issues and decoupling dogecoin from litecoin will significantly benefit the security profile of both projects while making bitcoin ecofriendlyveriblocks technology enables any blockchain to inherit bitcoins security in an entirely decentralized trustless transparent and permissionless dttp速 manner adhering to the same core attributes which make bitcoin the worlds most powerful digital data integrity solutionwhile some projects in the blockchain ecosystem utilize proofofstake pos proofofcapacity poc and other alternative security protocols in their quest for perceived efficiency improvements the veriblock team argues that these solutions are fundamentally opposed to the decentralized ethos that bitcoin was founded upon without a proofofwork component pos and poc are fundamentally insecure and is more analogous to the traditional finance world where financial institutions can hold funds hostage and blackball transactions at whim sanchez said these alternative security protocols dont solve the same problems or provide the same benefits of bitcoins proofofwork so comparing their efficiency to bitcoin is a nonstarter however using a technology like proofofproof backstops these weaklysubjective security protocols with a proofofwork component making them viablethe veriblock team plans to continue developing technologies that leverage bitcoin to provide creative solutions to improve the security of financial law enforcement and intellectual property infrastructureabout the veriblock foundationthe veriblock foundation is a cayman islands nonprofit committed to increasing awareness and adoption of the veriblock blockchain and its proofofproof security protocol veriblock inherits security from bitcoin in a completely decentralized trustless transparent and permissionless dttp速 manner following the same attributes that made bitcoin great and allows any other blockchain to reinforce their existing security with the full proofofwork power of bitcoin in the same mannermedia contactalexis quintalrelated imagesveriblockpngveriblocksource veriblock
