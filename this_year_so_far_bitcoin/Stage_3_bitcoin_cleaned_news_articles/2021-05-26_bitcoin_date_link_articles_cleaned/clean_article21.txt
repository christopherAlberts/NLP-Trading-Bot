eric voskuil is a veteran bitcoin developer and one of the lead maintainers of libbitcoin the first implementation of the bitcoin source code he’s the author of “cryptoeconomics fundamental principles of bitcoin” a deeply researched and reasoned take on bitcoin’s core mechanics austrian economics and anarchy he also founded the cryptoecon professional conference which took place in hanoi vietnam in early this article is excerpted from the node coindesks daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news you can subscribe to get the full newsletter herethe topic of funding bitcoin development is important some companies will hire a bitcoin dev some won’t how do you incentivize firms to “give back” to the open source commonsif they see an advantage to doing so they will do it the developer must be able to provide value that a company needs like any other employee developers can’t support themselves on charity the tragedy of the commons is often interpreted as a market failure but this is not the case a commons is property owned by the state as in a “public” grazing land people don’t pay for it and all must use it or their competitors will do so and put them out of businessso the commons either fails to be useful either due to overuse and arbitrary constraint or becomes private property again paid for the market determines the price that ensures supply and satisfies demand if companies need it they will pay for it a lot of people work on open source because they want to and can afford to others get paid for it i don’t see any reason or way to improve upon basic market rationalityare there any lessons or takeaways from the taproot upgrade processi could see during the segwit  activation process that a lot of people were drawing false conclusions those then predictably surfaced during the taproot process for some reason the developer community which surely knows better didn’t speak up when clear errors had become accepted truths i can’t count the number of people who told me that they were surprised to hear that soft forks are not “backward compatible” unless enforced by majority hash power a fork is a fork if you change the rules you are on a new coin the only question becomes how many people will join you hash power enforcement is the only way to ensure that everyone comes along once people started to understand this momentum shifted rapidlybitcoin will only thrive to the extent that it can operate outside of what are ultimately political strictures that is after all why it existspeople had been led to believe it was just a choice and that “user activation” had been done before bip   which is not the case core devs certainly understand this but for some reason did not speak up – though they did show significant resistance to shipping code that they knew could easily cause a chain split while the bitcoin core team is very diverse there are real pressures this is why amir  started libbitcoin and the bip process if anything we should take away that it’s healthy to have truly independent developers which necessarily means independent projectssubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policyis there anyone “in charge” of bitcoin core considering only a handful have “commit access” to the githubthere are way too many people who want to commit code – into what is in many ways a fragile codebase – for nobody to be in charge there is necessarily a small group of people who ultimately decide what gets in and what doesn’t this isn’t a problem as there is nothing stopping someone from doing exactly what amir  and others have done it’s only a matter of time before other implementations mature to the point where there will be a competitive market the idea heavily promoted by many bitcoin core devs that consensus criticality precludes competition is selfserving and ultimately irrelevant there are many versions of bitcoin core some of which have shown themselves even in a single version as a result of platform dependencies to not be consensusconsistent dave collins wrote a good article about it back in edward snowden for one has said onchain privacy should be the biggest priority in bitcoin development there are more users than ever a greater interest in bitcoin among regulators and law enforcement and an industry made out of onchain surveillance why have bitcoin developers shied from implementing privacy features at the protocol leveli’m not aware that they have it’s really the central aspect of core developmentthe common view is that miners are goliath to users’ david you said this morning it’s more of a goliath versus goliath situation could you add a little more herethe term “user” is ambiguous the people who matter in the context of rule changes are miners those who are presently confirming transactions and merchants those who are presently accepting bitcoin the latter category is likely at least as centralized and stateregulated as mining the sea of hodlers has no say whatsoever in such changes if they aren’t accepting bitcoin themselves not via exchanges they don’t have any ability to reject invalid coins that is the purpose of validation and the essence of enforcementwill minerenforced upgrades become the norm as the network gets bigger or will there be a place for user activated soft forksit’s already the norm user activation does also happen resulting in altcoins the question is always how to get everyone to change their rules and at the same time you can either get greater than  of hash power miners or  of the economy merchants a soft fork is a new coin the benefit to using soft forks is that majority hash power can bring everyone else along if they don’t you have an altcoin it’s certainly possible that the old coin could die out or the new but with hashpower signaling a large part of the economy can start enforcing or activate at the same time and the rest of the economy can change the rules over time without hashpower enforcement chain splits are practically inevitableany thoughts on the musksaylor bitcoin mining council or on the larger conversation of bitcoin’s energy consumptioni’ve written on energy waste theories they really just don’t make any sense there is a cost to securing all things and that cost is what the threat must exceed to be successful those costs are all grounded in energy bitcoin suffers from a pr problem in that its costs are entirely visible
