its been a rough month or so for bitcoin cryptobtc after skyrocketing to an alltime high in midapril the popular cryptocurrency is now down by close to the decline was even worse until tesla ceo elon musk tweeted on monday that he had spoken with usbased bitcoin miners who committed to publishing their current and planned renewable energy usage musk is viewed as having helped trigger the cryptocurrencys plunge in may after he tweeted that tesla was suspending all purchases of its vehicles using bitcoin because of the high energy requirements for its mining and transactions  electricity that is largely generated by the burning of fossil fuelsthese gyrations have undoubtedly frustrated many fans of the cryptocurrency what should they do one option is to invest elsewhere here are three stocks to buy if youve got the bitcoin blues squaresquare nysesq stands out as a company that directly benefits from bitcoin but it has a clear pathway to growth regardless of what happens with the cryptocurrency the companys cash app supports buying and selling bitcoin a feature that added more than  billion in revenues for square in the first quarter however squares profits werent boosted nearly as much by its bitcoinrelated business because the companys profit margins from cryptocurrency transactions are quite thinthere are plenty of reasons other than its bitcoin support to consider investing in square for example the company continues to expand its seller ecosystem it started out focusing primarily on credit card processing but has built out its platform with a range of products and services that make it sticky for merchantssquares expansion efforts were highlighted earlier this week in a bloomberg article that reported the company plans to introduce business checking and savings accounts this would be another step into traditional banking services  a big market opportunity for the companycash app though remains squares biggest growth driver use of the cash card debit card linked to the app has skyrocketed square is also finding ways to integrate its cash app and seller ecosystemsdigital payments are destined to grow regardless of what happens with bitcoin and square is one of the companies thats bestpositioned to profit from this trend nvidiaback in the gold rush days it was often said that those who sold picks and shovels made more money than the gold miners did in todays world of bitcoin mining nvidia nasdaqnvda ranks as a top provider of picks and shovels its graphics processing units gpus are among the best on the market for powering bitcoin mining rigsnvidia cant track exactly how many of its gpus are being used for crypto mining however analysts estimated that between  million and  million worth of them were purchased for that purpose in its fiscal  fourth quarter which ended jan   accounting for between  and  of the companys total revenuemost of nvidias gpus are used in gaming and in data centers and those markets are providing most of its revenue growth that momentum seems likely to continue as the popularity of gaming keeps increasing and the use of artificial intelligence in more apps is driving demand for powerful servers highernvidias share price is about to decline sharply  but for a good reason the company plans to conduct a fourforone stock split in july this move will give it a share price thats more accessible to retail investors and just might provide a catalyst to a stock that has already delivered a solid yeartodate gain dermtechdermtech nasdaqdmtk has absolutely nothing to do with any cryptocurrency so why should investors with the bitcoin blues take a look at this specific healthcare stock well dermtech is currently trading even further off of its peak than bitcoin is the stock also has a crystalclear growth opportunity while bitcoins growth prospects are a lot murkierdermtech focuses on skin genomics the companys pigmented lesion assay pla product is used to diagnose melanoma for its test an adhesive patch is placed on the patients skin then removed and sent to dermtechs lab where genomic testing is performed on the skin cells attached to it to determine if melanoma is presentyoud probably expect that this approach would be more appealing to patients than being cut by a dermatologist to obtain a biopsy its also more accurate and cheaper pla is  times less likely to miss a melanoma diagnosis than the standard surgical biopsy approach and its roughly  less expensive per lesion testeddermtech is still only in its early stages of growth however the company has secured reimbursement deals from several major payers notably including medicare its also developing genomics tests that target other types of skin cancer for investors looking for a big rebound opportunity dermtech could be an even better bet than bitcoin
