bitcoin’s spectacular recent price collapse should serve as a timely reminder to policymakers that asset price bubbles have the inconvenient habit of coming to abrupt endsthis is an especially helpful reminder at a time when the world is experiencing a global “everything” asset and credit market bubble that is premised on the erroneous assumption that interest rates will stay low forever it would also appear to be a useful reminder at a time when president biden joe bidenformer rep rohrabacher says he took part in jan  march to capitol but did not storm building saudis picked up drugs in cairo used to kill khashoggi report biden looking to build momentum for putin meeting more’s excessive budget stimulus is soon likely to lead to economic overheating that will cause interest rates to risedriven by a speculative frenzy reminiscent of the  century tulip mania bitcoin’s price rocketed from around  at the start of  to a peak of over  by midapril  more dramatic yet was its spectacular price decline over the past month that was prompted by a regulatory crackdown in china and by elon musk elon reeve muskon the money house democrats line up  in spending without budget  gop takes aim at irs  house democrat mulls wealth tax what will elon musk and richard branson do about jeff bezos flying into space republicans open new line of attack on irs more’s clarification that tesla after all would not accept bitcoin’s in payment for its vehicles within a matter of weeks bitcoin’s price halved to below  thereby wiping out around  billion in value from this marketadvertisementbeing held mainly by nonfinancial private sector investors bitcoin’s recent price collapse is unlikely to send ripples through the global financial system but the same cannot be said should today’s global “everything” asset and credit market bubble burst this would seem to be the case considering how very much more pervasive are these bubbles than was the case in  when the bubbles were largely confined to the us housing and credit marketsthe truth is that the reduction in interest rates to their zero bound and the unprecedentedly large increase in the size of the major central banks’ balance sheets in response to the  pandemic has forced investors to stretch for yield not only has this led to equity and housing market price bubbles around the globe it has also led to a marked increase in lending to risky borrowers in both the advanced and the emerging market economies at very low interest rates that do not adequately compensate the lenders for default riskan examination of equity valuations provides a clear indication of the amount of froth in the us equity market as measured by the cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio today’s us equity valuations are more than double their long run average and are now at levels similar to those prevailing on the eve of the  stock market crash similarly signs of a bubble in the us housing market are provided by the fact that over the past  months us housing prices increased by  percent or at their fastest pace since one indication of the global credit market bubble is provided by the fact that the interest rate spreads on loans to the riskiest us corporate borrowers are now at close to their alltime lows another indication is that capital has continued to flow to the emerging market economies at low interest rates despite that in the pandemic’s wake these economies’ public finances have never looked worse than they do todaythe biden administration’s highly expansive budget policy at a time that there is a very large amount of pentup demand in the economy heightens the risk that today’s asset price and credit market will come to an early end it does so by heightening the chances that the us economy will overheat by year end which would force the federal reserve to raise interest rates to meet its inflation objectiveadvertisementin its recent financial stability report the federal reserve acknowledged that some asset price markets were characterized by froth and some hedge funds were excessively leveraged it also cautioned that asset markets could experience large price declines that could raise financial stability concernsthis makes it all the more difficult to understand why at this late stage in the asset price cycle the fed continues to buy  billion a month in us treasury bonds and mortgagebacked securities by so doing it risks further inflating today’s asset bubbles thereby setting the us economy up for a hard lending when the fed is eventually forced to raise interest ratesdesmond lachman is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute he was formerly a deputy director in the international monetary fund’s policy development and review department and the chief emerging market economic strategist at salomon smith barney
