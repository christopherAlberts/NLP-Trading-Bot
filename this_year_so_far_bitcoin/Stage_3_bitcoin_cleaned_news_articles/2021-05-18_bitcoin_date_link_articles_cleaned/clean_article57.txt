mike colyer leads one of north america’s biggest crypto mining companies foundry owned by digital currency group coindesk’s parent company the startup emerged in  and has quickly come to exemplify a trend the comeback of us crypto mining after years of living in the shadows of china’s greater hash powerwe caught up with colyer for a preview of his thoughts on the china vs us rivalry in bitcoin mining institutional adoption and the controversial concept of “clean bitcoin”consensus  mike colyer will appear at this year’s coindesk’s consensus conference on monday may  in a track entitled “big capital how north america is finding its spot in the global hashrate race” register hererelated dave portnoy just wants to have funthe following has been edited lightly for brevity and claritycoindesk foundry is aimed at institutional clients why should they start mining bitcoin and other assets what’s wrong with just holdingdecentralized infrastructure means anybody in the world can participate in these networks it opens up an incredible opportunity with mining these computers are basically securing the bitcoin network and you get paid to secure the bitcoin network it’s an incredible concept and we’re seeing more institutional players recognize itin the early days bitcoin you could mine it on your pc then it moved from cpu to gpu mining for basic mining and then it became more about who’s got the capital to deploy large amounts of these computers in the last bull run every once in a while you’d get somebody who would deploy say  million worth of machines today people are making    million purchases of equipment and it’s scaling it’s not a question of ‘are the institutions going to get into this game’ they’re already here and they’re doing itstory continuescan china control the bitcoin network it really can’t but for the uneducated there’s a perception it could and therefore they don’t get involvedrelated research shows how sec actions move marketsin the next phase we’re going to see energy companies realize they can combine bitcoin mining to make their energy projects more cost effective they’re already experimenting with this and we’re going to see them deploy significant amounts of money in the space after that the next wave will be nationstates having a strategy around bitcoin mining just like they have a strategy around gold mining or any natural resourcesyou definitely have to bet countercyclical if you want to make the big returns but if you’re in it for the long term i think you can see a good steady return on your investment over time if bitcoin were to crash the network is going to adjust the difficulty over time and you can still make money in the downside cycle of the industry so it kind of protects the downside and if you’re investing longer term there’s an additional premium over the value of bitcoinin the long term bitcoin mining is going to be more like a utility you buy a utility stock because it’s stable and it’s gonna produce a dividend over time and i think the same thing is true for bitcoin mining we’re just in the early stages where it’s a little more volatiledoes the us need a national mining strategywe put a big focus on helping decentralize the bitcoin network so we wanted to get more hashrate into north america the us was behind the game early on and china got out to a fast start on bitcoin mining but what we’ve seen over the last three years is bigger institutional players got into the game and they started building out large data centerslast year we saw they were short on cash to buy the nextgeneration machines and that’s why we decided to launch foundry we launched an equipment financing business to help get them the cash to buy these machines so they could get more hash power into north america a significant amount of the equipment is now being purchased by north american miners and we’re seeing a lot of hashrates start to come to the usit’s very important long term for the us to have a proactive strategy around bitcoin mining i think it’s done differently in the us in the sense that we’re capitalists we’re a democracy we’re a capitalist society so i think it’s around creating a regulatory environment and today it’s very friendly for it to just flourish we’re seeing this with the different stateskentucky is passing laws to entice miners to come there the governor of texas is tweeting on how great texas is for mining of course though new york just continues to make announcements on how it wants to kill business in new yorki’m glad the internet was essentially created and funded out of the united states and i’m glad google calls the us home because i think that does provide a different online experience because of that we want to have a strong footprint in blockchain technology so we can help guide where this thing goes over time and a big part of it starts with the infrastructurechina still dominates hash power should we worry about it taking over somehowwe feel like there’s a certain percentage of people who are not investing in bitcoin because of this narrative that china controls the mining space or bitcoin is controlled by china we feel very strongly about killing that narrative so more people  feel comfortable getting involved with bitcointhe reality is yes china does have a lot of the hashrate yes it does have a monopoly right now on the pools or it did have a monopoly on the pools but there really is not much it could do to attack bitcoin or control bitcoin right if all of a sudden china says we now control  of the bitcoin network and we’re going to  attack it naturally we’re going to see a fork in bitcoin there’s going to be a china version and there’s going to be a restoftheworld versionif you go back in time it actually played out that way in  with the big blocksmall block war bitcoin did fork and we had bitcoin cash and where’s that today it’s essentially irrelevantso can china control the bitcoin network it really can’t but for the uninformed there’s a perception it could and therefore they don’t get involved and that’s why it’s been really important for us to kind of rebalance it from a perception perspectivesometimes we’re talking about a national competition between these two countries but when you peel it back and you look at us citizens and chinese citizens we’re trying to do the same thing we’re trying to build and strengthen the bitcoin network so we all have a bigger goal in mind that’s why i’m involved in bitcoin i think we’re building out a solution to the world’s problems and it is a totally unifying technology we’re not really competing with each other we’re trying to build something much greater than any one of us and that’s really gratifyingis there much demand from your clients for socalled “clean bitcoin”i’ve been in the mining space for four years in that time everyone has talked about a premium for virgin coins or newly minted coins but i have yet to find anybody anywhere who has been willing to pay a premium for those coinsso in my mind it’s more of a marketing kind of gimmickthe idea that there’s like a special claim on certain coins just doesn’t make any sense to me they’re fungible but if somebody does want to pay extra for a newly minted bitcoin i have lots available and i’m more than willing to sell those at a premium give me a call we can definitely help youbut we haven’t found anybody who’s actually willing to pay a premium so in my mind it’s more of a marketing kind of gimmick and you know when you start peeling it back the concept doesn’t even really make a lot of sense because you know every time you mine a block you’re adding it to the last block and you’re basically validating all transactions that ever existed on the bitcoin network and you strengthen that network also  million bitcoin have already been mined and are in existence there’s only  million bitcoin left are those all going to be special coins i don’t think so doesn’t make senserelated stories
