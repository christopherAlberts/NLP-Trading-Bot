it has been a bad week for the crypto space elon musk is widely believed to play a major role in crashing bitcoin’s price by  when he tweeted that tesla will no longer be accepting bitcoin he framed this backtracking as an environmental concern due to the high levels of energy consumption required in bitcoin mining as a result this had a cascading effect on almost all altcoins with very few exceptionsto set the record straight it is very difficult to portray bitcoin as an ecological problem not only do miners use renewable sources at a rate over  across all continents but when put into context with other sectors musk’s notorious tweet makes even less sensesource hass mccook mediumbased on this the situation has resulted in a number of different ideas floating around as to why musk made this decision some argue that the us government could be the motive behind the move as btc could potentially threaten the usd remember that musk has plenty of dealings with the government – subsidies green credits and a spacex contract musk afterall is known to leverage nearly  billion in government subsidies this substantial vested interest may have exerted enough pressure for him to abandon and besmirch the predominant cryptocurrency no doubt his  million followers will remember how corrosive he has become eroding the wealth of millions interestingly the creator of doge the dog coin musk has been bizarrely obsessed about for the last half year had no kind words to sharein this turmoil it is noticeable that bitcoin brought down much of the crypto sector with it demonstrating once again its gravitic force on the crypto ecosystem however what is also noticeable is that some projects have gone up and they are all related to smart contracts cardano ada is a highly anticipated direct competitor to ethereum promising more scalability and smart contracts with the alonzo upgradesee also how to buy ethereum ethstory continuesethereum is fastclosing to its full proofofstake pos transition with the upcoming london hard fork together with binance smart chain and polygon matic they have all outperformed bitcoin during the last month in terms of percentage price gains when paired with usdmatic vs ada vs eth vs btc performance source tradingviewalthough the current crypto downturn is significant it bears exploring what this shift in trends means for the relationship between ethereum and bitcoin more precisely is it likely that ethereum and bitcoin will switch places in other words are we about to see the “flippening”ethereum and bitcoin complement each otherif one were to describe the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap – bitcoin and ethereum – the former is the guardian of wealth while the latter is a utility juggernaut bitcoin’s own utility is quite limited in scope it can serve as a payment method but it has instead become a store of value with bitcoin cash bch and litecoin ltc taking the lead as more suitable crypto payment methodsas you can see on the chart below out of the four cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ethereum are aberrations in terms of average transaction feesbtc vs eth vs ltc vs bch transaction fees source bitinfochartscomoutside of being more popular bitcoin owes this drastically higher transaction fee compared to bch and ltc to its block size of only  mb this design decision cleared the way for the phenomenon of bitcoin “hodling” making it a digital asset akin to gold that draws its value as a hedge against inflationon the other hand ethereum’s  higher fee than even bitcoin should be a thing of the past by the year’s end ethereum is slowly progressing from the less scalable proofofwork consensus toward proofofstake leaving behind congestion and enormous transaction fees this transition did not come free of costbinance smart chain stepped in to fill the congestion gap achieving  more daily transactions than ethereum during the same period such a surge in popularity from a direct competitor speaks of the treasure ethereum holds – smart contracts in contrast to bitcoin ethereum’s blockchain is highly flexible able to store autoexecutable contracts within its data blocks all those exorbitantly expensive nfts that paraded across news headlines this year were mostly hosted on ethereumlikewise lending and borrowing protocols – uniswap maker aave compound and dozens of others – accumulated  billion in total value locked tvlthese defi dapps demonstrate on a daily basis that they can replace much of the existing banking infrastructure which brings us to the key value propositions bitcoin and ethereum playto borrow a metaphor from the world’s most popular office app think of bitcoin as an excel spreadsheet this secured and distributed record tracks the number of bitcoins in each cellethereum has the ability to do the same and beyond instead of just recording the number of crypto coins in each cell ethereum can build macros that interact with formulas among other cellshowever the cost of ethereum’s greater flexibility is vulnerability while there hasn’t yet been a documented instance of bitcoin’s blockchain getting compromised the same cannot be said of the protocols built on top of every blockchain—and ethereum has a lot of those flash loan attacks are the most common attack when it comes to ethereum’s smart contracts incurring great losseswe have yet to see how cardano performs when it unrolls its smart contract capability this leaves bitcoin in a special position that is not likely to be unseated together with its deflationary mechanism limited coin supply and incredibly strong network security bitcoin represents a peace of mind that no smart contractenabled blockchain has yet to achieveethereum is entering bullish territorywith bsc getting six times the traffic of ethereum one has to ask which one is likely to be the programmable blockchain while ethereum’s ongoing eth  upgrade and stillhigh fees leave it wide open to competition it has powerful winds behind its sails to eventually win the smart contract warsethereum holds by far the largest pool of developers according to electric capital as a number of open source dev ops tools are available to make remote work easier through collaboration managing developers remains a serious cog in defi development yet ethereum and its developer community have thus far been dominant in this sensein the last three years ethereum has widened its developer pool by  such a network effect would be exceedingly difficult to overcomeethereum is far more decentralized compared to bsc by magnitudes of degree – there are  validators on bsc compared to over  on ethereumethereum continues to hit record low eth token supply on exchanges indicating that bsc popularity is transitoryin other words all those eth hodlers are just waiting for ethereum’s  transition to proofofstake to finalizedefi smart contracts hold almost twice as much locked eth than centralized exchanges do once again indicating high demand for ethereum’s smart contract servicealongside bsc polkadot cardano near protocol and solana are ethereum’s top competitors all of which have also grown substantially nonetheless ethereum has another trick up its sleeve – polygon matic until the eth  upgrade completes matic is there to remove the congestion as a multichain scaling solution simply put polygon makes cheaper transactions possible by using ethereum’s sidechains which are called layer  solutionssuffice to say polygon has become tremendously successful in facilitating this goal as people try to flee high fees sushiswap the competitor to ethereum’s most popular protocol – uniswap – managed to accrue over  million in tvl since it announced it will launch on polygon a couple of days ago the sum increased to half a billionoverall the polygon network is currently lagging behind uniswap by one rank with  billion tvl compared to uniswap’s  billion as far as investments go this makes the network’s native token  matic  enter into the  investment rangesource tradingviewinterestingly one of the trending searches related to dogecoin doge is – “will doge ever reach one dollar” once again the contrast between doge and matic demonstrates that fundamentals always trounce meme hype doge over the long haulethereum is poised to go up but not over bitcoinno matter how much ethereum is viewed as the infrastructure for digital finance it still remains untested with a history of smart contract hacks while not all of this is directly ethereum’s fault it still affects ethereum on the other hand however this cannot be said of bitcoin it may not be as exciting as facilitating dapps but bitcoin’s draw as safeguarding wealth cannot be over underestimatedmoreover bitcoin is inherently deflationary unlike ethereum which relies on high demand to outpace inflation this demand may bring it to a new ath this year but not in the bitcoin range as far as bitcoin’s carbon footprint goes this is largely a matter of perceptiongiven the activity on social media that perception is turning against elon musk after all the data is already clear that most bitcoin miners use clean energy in turn this data is also clear to those who absolutely trounced musk on twitter including the owner of twitter himself – jack dorseysee more from benzinga©  benzingacom benzinga does
