fast forward to  just  years after graduating stanford with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer science through these memorable years i had scored internships at microsoft where i introduced myself to bill gates at the annual interns barbecue he held each summer and at ibm the aging lion of the modern computer industry i had held management positions at yahoo and other american and chinese technology companies and was now about to start work on my biggest role yet i was one of the five vice presidents managing a new ecommerce service in china for walmart the world’s largest company by revenuewalmart figured it could challenge chinese online retail powerhouses taobao and jingdong in the world’s most populated country walmart called its effort project pandathis is an excerpt from the promise of bitcoin the future of money and how it can work for you by bobby c lee mcgraw hill may  published todayconsensus  bobby lee will appear at coindesks consensus by coindesk our virtual experience may  in the state of crypto in china track register herebut it quickly became apparent that project panda faced an uphill struggle as much because of internal politics as outside competition walmart was quick to hedge its bet by investing in an established chinese ecommerce company yihaodian and pitted our newly formed division against them we had no chance my  technology team did yeoman’s work but couldn’t catch up to our established inhouse competitor within a year we could all see the endgame for project pandaduring that year i had my first conversation about bitcoin with my brother charlie had graduated from mit’s fiveyear master’s program in electrical engineering and computer science and was working as a software engineer on google’s chrome os team charlie outlined how bitcoin worked and how it had built a small global following in its two years of existence more importantly charlie made a compelling case for satoshi’s bitcoin thesis and its potential for revolutionizing finance i was hookedmcgraw hilljust as i started my promising walmart career i mined my first bitcoins the experience was addictive and i started looking for graphics cards that would accelerate my computer’s ability to solve the algorithmic problems that would reward me with more bitcoins the global bitcoin community was tiny but i suspect there was at least one other hobbyist in shanghai who always seemed to be one step ahead of me apparently he bought out the local computer stores’ supply of highend graphics cards the shelves were empty at every store i visited thankfully i found supplies overseasi mined bitcoins from the summer through the fall of  my single mining rig ran all day every day and it was enough to heat up that whole empty guest room in my apartment in downtown shanghaiin late  shortly after leaving walmart i decided to take an early exit off the traditional technology management career path and make bitcoin my fulltime career it was a bold step into an uncharted field the possibilities were enormous but the truth was i wasn’t sure exactly what i would domining didn’t offer enough variety once you knew what you were doing it wasn’t mentally stimulating but bitcoin was just about to catch the public eye what would consumers need to quicken the pace i had bought additional bitcoins on a local exchange website called btcchinacom created by two chinese men in their late twenties one a computer programmer from nanjing and the other a businessman from beijing a switch turned on inside me this was in the days before litecoin ethereum and all of the other cryptocurrencies had launched the idea behind btcchina was inspired and it compelled me to actmy single mining rig ran all day every day and it was enough to heat up that whole empty guest room in my apartment in downtown shanghaihere was an easytouse bitcoin exchange platform available to everyone in china its functions needed work but that’s where i could apply my years of experience building consumerfacing platforms i emailed them cold asking via customer support to see if i could speak with the boss a week later i was in beijing outlining my btcchina vision over a peking duck dinner and when the three of us had closed the restaurant we continued at a coffee shop late into the night our backgrounds were complementary and our passion and vision were aligned we would make a good teamsubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policythey were skilled entrepreneurs who had a sound foundation but they lacked managerial knowhow vision and a sense of how to find funding to energize the business i could bring bigpicture corporate expertise to the mix and an understanding of how technology startups thrive i also knew about the bumps of earlystage companies like startups in most new industries btcchina might see huge spikes and then lulls of activity over the ensuing weeks i purchased shares in the company took on the title of cofounder and ceo and immediately began speaking with venture capitalists to raise money when we closed the deal on my role in early  bitcoin’s price was just under about this time bitcoin prices and trading volumes started climbing we were using my shanghai apartment as our headquarters but after recruiting two customer service representatives and an exwalmart colleague we leased our first office a  open floor plan in the xujiahui neighborhood not far from shanghai’s business epicenter it was a small office on the twentythird floor of an office building with brightly colored walls painted by the previous tenant an internet content delivery network company we were excited to get started and to build a real bitcoin company in chinaby then i had also secured a  million investment round led by venture firm lightspeed china an offshoot of the famed menlo park calif venture firm by the same name lightspeed china counted some of the country’s highestprofile tech companies in its portfolio we were the first cryptocurrency company in all of asia to receive venture fundingwe adopted best practices that were drawn from the american startup world but were new to china’s emerging economy we provided free sodas and drinks at the office handed out tshirts and other gear with our corporate logo and took employees to the movies to foster team building i borrowed several traditions from yahoo including one where we gave employees customdesigned coffee mugs each christmas employees collected a different personalized mug for every year of servicethe hours were long we even made saturday a regular work day on a memorable company retreat in the fall of  at a vacation island outside shanghai we spent most of the time in conference rooms revamping our platform to accommodate a sudden jolt in trading volumes bitcoin had just passed but btcchina also ran a lean ship we stayed put in our small space even as we quadrupled our workforce we mapped product designs and engineering solutions on the glass walls enclosing the conference rooms which served as makeshift whiteboards we felt we were part of a bold mission the introduction of a new type of decentralized digital asset based on a technology with huge potential called blockchain we focused everything we did on building our business into something that the average consumer and investor could recognizeexiting btcchinathe ride was often challenging for every new customer we heard from dozens of naysayers what is this new currency how can it be valuable why would anyone use it does it have the government’s support who is regulating it isn’t it more vulnerable to hacking than an online bank accountthen there were the shocksafter shooting to over  by late  bitcoin quickly lost twothirds of its value stoking fears that it was no better than play money meanwhile two aggressive wellsupported competitors emerged okcoin and huobi they reduced the trading fees so we started a price war by cutting trading commissions to zero that was good for customers but drained our cash reserves we cut staff introduced new trading features and other new services to boost sales and went out to seek a fresh cash infusion a small surge in bitcoin prices and the subsequent demand for exchange services near the end of  helped push us into cash positive territory we were finally profitablethe next obstacle arose two years later when the chinese government started cracking down on crypto trading and initial coin offerings a mechanism for funding blockchain projects largely because these were activities that regulators could not control in september  we shuttered the domestic btcchina exchange for trading at the time we boasted over one million registered users a staff of  and four separate offices we kept open our international business called btcc based in our hong kong office in january  we sold our business to a hong kong–based blockchain investment fundthe acquisition came when the price of bitcoin was hovering over  – down from a muchballyhooed high of  a month earlier but more than  higher than the price when btcchina opened for businessbitcoin was fulfilling satoshi nakamoto’s vision that a digital currency open to anyone controlled by no one would find a wide following in his  paper “bitcoin a peertopeer electronic cash system” satoshi had outlined a system that would allow individual parties to execute financial transactions without the participation of an intermediary controlling entitythese controlling entities or centralized organizations – most prominently banks credit card companies or increasingly electronic payment services like paypal – had traditionally filled an accounting role ensuring the accuracy of every activity although bank loans and deposits have roots from before the birth of christ the system upon which the modern banking model bases itself dates to the medici family in the italian renaissance the medicis recognized an ongoing need among the powerful elite for wellorganized financial management services on a large scale via one powerful entityover the centuries the public came to trust these centralized organizations as the most secure places to park their hardearned cash banks ranked among society’s most respected organizations they were too big to fail – or were theythe ride was often challenging for every new customer we heard from dozens of naysayersjust three months after the economic crash of  when several large financial institutions failed satoshi’s ninepage paper offered a more streamlined efficient alternative to the traditional system satoshi had recognized the greatest flaw in the traditional models namely that these centralized organizations controlled every activity within their networks they could delay stop and even reverse transactions that they determined had not met their standards fairness and objectivity often did not guide their decisions moreover the cost of their mediation services increased transaction costs and perversely the banks were financially incentivized more and more for their involvement in these financial transactions“the system works well enough” satoshi wrote but upon closer inspection it also created obstacles to which most consumers had grown immune such as transaction costs and lack of controlhis electronic payment system removed the impediments allowing “two willing parties to transact directly” to move payments from one digital account to another with access based on memorizing a key of binary numbers he described the coins as “a chain of digital signatures” or bitcoins the nowwidely used term refers to bits the zeros and ones that are the smallest units of data in computer languagea network of computersavvy participants miners used their computation power to ensure the integrity of this new currency system by verifying and recording each transaction on a digital ledger open for public review each timestamped transaction approved by a consensus of miners would become part of a chain of data blocks called the blockchain to falsify a transaction would require altering earlier entries alerting the group and invalidating that record and all subsequent ones the system would be safe from attack as long as miners with honorable intent outnumbered those with malicious designs the whole system was selfhealing selfreinforcing and selfincentivizedthe system incentivized people to participate by offering bitcoin awards for their work as miners which required solving an algorithmic equation mathematical certainty was at the heart of satoshi’s system and that would propel it forward rather than faith in institutions that were more easily corruptible or had swung from their original intent its rapid growth from the idea of a singular genius to a community surpassing  million people globally in early  this is my rough estimate based on my tracking of the industry and discussions with other bitcoin experts reflected pentup demand for a monetary system that could give everyone in the world more control of their assetsbitcoin was also a manifestation of a larger movement a new scrutiny of old ways and embrace of digital innovations that had already transformed much of how we live and work money and currency were the last frontiers in this movementbut for me bitcoin never felt completely new it possessed a familiar quality at first i couldn’t pinpoint the feeling but then i realized bitcoin was the virtual equivalent of gold the substance that my greatgrandmother’s family was named after that my paternal grandparents had concealed in their clothes to start a new life in noncommunist hong kong and that my family revered and collected for generations in short gold had given all of us a sense of securitythey knew that gold held its value – or better – because of its scarcity and its special properties that have entranced people throughout history qualities that made it the most suitable form of natural money for thousands of yearsthe shine that embodies wealththe authorperhaps more importantly my goldbearing ancestors had direct control over their most important asset they didn’t need bank approvals or waiting periods it was a tumultuous unpredictable time for them as they made their escape just years after living through one of history’s most violent periods my grandparents thought a lot about security both in the physical sense and in the financial sense they looked for solid ground wherever they could find iti’m finding similar reassurance in bitcoin now as the world becomes more unpredictable political unrest fed by populist movements environmental concerns and a fastchanging global economy that seems to generate new winners and losers every few days have challenged much of what most of us have assumed would always be true the next downturn seems to be lurking just out of sight brexit tariffs protectionism canyoning divides in wealth between haves and havenots social inequity growing racial divides and perhaps most importantly a growing inability of people to empathize with one anotherwhat comes nexteven in the current lowinflationary environment the money i’ve earned does not buy me as much as it did  years ago when i mined my first bitcoins yet untethered from the forces that determine economic policy my cryptocurrency holdings have risen in value over  i couldn’t have done nearly as well investing in retail juggernaut amazon – even over  years and the great thing is the superior performance of bitcoin continues
