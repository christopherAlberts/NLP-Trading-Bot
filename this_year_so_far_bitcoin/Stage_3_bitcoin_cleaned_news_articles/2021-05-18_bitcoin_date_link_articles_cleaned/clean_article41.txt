charlie munger is known for telling investors exactly how he feels about popular trends and he recently did exactly that about bitcoin cryptobtc in this fool live clip recorded on may  foolcom contributor matt frankel cfp and jason moser discuss the berkshire hathaway vice chairmans bitcoin comments and why hes not likely to change his mind anytime soonmatt frankel well lets get to the bitcoin part because lets get this out of the way because i know jason is going to be triggered and offended by these commentsjason moser hate mail is addressed to matt frankelfrankel theyre not my wordsmoser no thats right were just communicating what weve heard but i thought this would be a fun one to talk about so yeah lets dig in a little bit on mungers feelings on bitcoinfrankel first of all buffett dodged the question he even said im dodging the questionmoser its like politicsfrankel he completely understands that his opinion on bitcoin is not a popular onemoser yeahfrankel buffett does munger has always been an unfiltered speaker whatever filter he had now that hes  is gonemoser yeahfrankel hes had some pretty mean comments about bitcoin through the years already he said of course i hate the bitcoin success thats what he said he said i dont welcome a currency thats so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth nor do i like shuffling out a few extra billions and billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air if that wasnt enough he went on to say that its disgusting and contrary to the interest of civilizationmoser wowfrankel tell us how you really feel charliemoser those are strong words agree with them or disagree with them were talking about obviously his feelings on the matter and granted hes not the only one im sure that feels that way but yeah it does seem like hes opening the invitation for a lot of blow back there from the younger generations of investors who feel like hes too old he just doesnt get it bitcoin is the future whatever it may be everybody has got an opinion on the matter its not like charlie is just some guy who picked a couple of stocks and rode that success hes been part of building something pretty special and pretty meaningful over the last several decades he knows a thing or twofrankel i dont want to get involved in the twitter war i know theres a lot of people at the motley fool who love bitcoin who are big believers in itmoser yeahfrankel its a very polarizing investing topicmoser yeah i think its interesting too because you said these are his words but he refers to it as a currency there is a debate to be had as currency versus asset two very different things it certainly depends on the perspective of how youre viewing it whether its an asset or a currency or something elsefrankel yes what i would say is dont be so quick to dismiss munger as ok boomer or any of those i think hes actually above a boomermoser i think youre rightfrankel i think the oldest boomers are in their  right now and hes well beyond thatmoser thats no surprise his feelings on the matter i would imagine with things like dogecoin cryptodoge they just become magnified and so there you go you can agree with him or disagree with him but clearly theres more than one opinion on the matterfrankel i saw something on a chat that said you think his comments on bitcoin are bad you better be lucky they didnt mention dogecoin because it couldve explodedmoser i have a feeling there are going to be more of these types of things introduced in the near future it will be interesting to watch how this market shakes outfrankel you know what else ive noticed nobody just kind of likes bitcoin everyone either thinks its the next big thing in finance or theyre charlie mungermoser its difficult for me to fully wrap my head around why it matters ive always said and i stand by this bitcoin bulls to me theyve done a phenomenally horrible job at explaining why it matters im not saying it doesnt dont get me wrong so dont at me understand i dont care i just dont care about bitcoin but what i am saying is theyve done a very poor job of explaining why it really matters you can tell me about decentralized and unhackable and yadda yadda yadda but theyve just done a very poor job of explaining why it really matters im sure we will get a lot of people explaining from here on out why it really matters on twitter and whatnot thats fine but it will be interesting to watch that space evolve because youre right its either one or the other you either love it or you hate it and i would add maybe a third category and i think i fall on this third category you just are apathetic you just dont believe in itfrankel i was going to start calling you jason mungermoser i just dont care theres a third category so i dont lose sleep over it if it works out great if it doesnt fine you know what i know what i dont know maybe munger will be proud of me because ive realized what i dont know and thats really one of his more famous quotes it revolves around hey know what you dont know because thats when real wisdom starts kicking in well see sign of a good investor is the ability to change ones mind so maybe hell change his mind one day i dont know well have to wait and see
