blockchain for climate foundation founder joseph pallant encourages “green choices” to offset the impact of the bitcoin network’s carbon footprintspeaking with bloomberg about how to temper the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies pallant contrasted ethereum and bitcoin first he highlighted ethereum’s migration to a less taxing proofofstake consensus mechanism over the next year this could drive ethereum’s carbon footprint down to near zero “that’s why we’re very comfortable using it for our work at the blockchain for climate foundation” he saidhowever with bitcoin he emphasized that it would not be using proofofstake ripple cofound chris larsen recently wrote that bitcoin’s energyintensive proofofwork mechanism could threaten the overall growing adoption of crypto because of this mitigating bitcoin’s impact would require other tools pallant continuedoffsetting bitcoin environmental impactbecause bitcoin lacks plans to mitigate the burden of its proofofwork consensus mechanism pallant suggested making “green choices” for instance using renewable energy as an energy source for bitcoin mining canadian company digihost recently announced that over  of the energy for its mining operations came from renewable energy sourcesanother suggestion he posed was purchasing carbon credits to offset bitcoin’s carbon footprint he highlighted another canadian company ninepoint which offers a bitcoin etf ninepoint is working with carbon x to calculate the impact of the bitcoin in its etf and purchase credits to offset itpallant emphasized that potential investors understanding the environmental impact of their individual choices would be key for facilitating a “cleaner bitcoin” he added that incentivizing miners to share data about their carbon footprint could go a long way in this regard although “they’re notoriously hard to get to share data because they really need their privacy” pallant admitteddespite the reticence in sharing data the blockchain for climate foundation executive director cited widely accepted estimates of crypto’s climate impact he mentioned a study from cambridge university which put bitcoin’s carbon footprint at around  million tons of carbon emissions per year tesla ceo elon musk cited this same study when he announced that the company would no longer accept bitcoin paymentsmeanwhile pallant added that ethereum’s impact amounts to  million tons per year however he concluded that ethereum’s transition to proofofstake would likely lead to the footprint’s neutralization
