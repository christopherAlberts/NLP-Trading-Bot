patrick li’s bitcoin mine used to be filled with the persistent hum of rows and rows of computers all busy around the clock solving the complicated mathematical puzzles needed to keep the world’s most popular cryptocurrency operationalli  had set up shop in the northern inner mongolia autonomous region which once welcomed businesses like his to use the abundance of locally produced coalpowered electricitybut last year china’s central government admonished inner mongolia for missing its electricity consumption reduction targets as a result in march the region decided to show certain energyintensive industries the door including cryptocurrency mines like li’syou can listen to an audio version of this article via “china stories” a supchinaproduced podcast sharing the best writing

that president xi jinping has made reaching carbon neutrality a major government goal for now bitcoin’s fate is in limbo li bo vice president of china’s central bank the people’s bank of china told reporters in april that policymakers are currently deciding on what regulations to apply to the virtual currencyany outcome will be felt globally the country’s share of the entire bitcoin network’s hash rate — a measure of computing power — stood at  in april  the most recent available figure at the cambridge bitcoin electricity consumption index cbeci the global bitcoin community was reminded of china’s central role when after a fatal coal mine accident in april authorities in the northwestern xinjiang uyghur autonomous region launched safety checks that disrupted power supplies to local bitcoin mines and hash rates fell by up to energy nomadslike many other blockchainbased currencies bitcoin is decentralized meaning there is no bank or country in control instead miners use computing power to verify transactions for which they receive bitcoins in return in  li smelled a business opportunity he decided life as a civil servant wasn’t for him spent a month’s salary on a computer and began mining bitcoin in pursuit he says of “financial freedom”back then he was far from the only one given china’s position as a manufacturing hub for electronics the right equipment was easy to get hold of local governments were eager to attract what they saw as “hightech” industries and china grew to become the dominant cryptocurrency country it is today over the years li witnessed bull markets that minted millionaires as well as collapses that crushed dreams his only regret is selling bitcoin he now knows he should have held ontobitcoin is coded to create competition whichever miner does the quickest calculations for a particular set of transactions receives the reward this has set off an arms race with miners incentivized to use as much topoftheline equipment as possible racking up enormous energy bills luckily for them the price of bitcoin has risen too at the start of  the year li began  bitcoin was worth  with the exchange rate above  for much of  mining remains exceedingly profitablebitcoin is essentially an energy currency  xu peng professorbut the environment bears the cost an article published april in scientific journal nature communications concluded china’s bitcoinmining industry was on track to be responsible for  million tons of carbon emissions by  exceeding the total greenhouse gas emissions of the czech republicthe immense power needs of bitcoin mining determine where profits can be made “like nomads looking for places with water and grass we miners seek places with cheap and stable power supply” says liu fei ceo of bixin mining one of china’s largest cryptocurrency companies chinese cryptocurrency miners alternate between areas rich in hydropower during the rainy summer and return to northern areas like xinjiang and inner mongolia that are rich in coalfired electricity during the dry season some go to even greater lengths to cut costs last year authorities discovered a bitcoin mine disguised as burial tombs stealing electricity from a nearby company“the fact that whoever has cheap energy has more bitcoin mining capacity shows that bitcoin is essentially an energy currency” says xu peng a professor of mechanical engineering at tongji university who specializes in sustainabilityan often proposed solution to bitcoin’s energy footprint is replacing the current mining mechanism called “proof of work” with “proof of stake” — a way to verify transactions that doesn’t require nearly as much computing power but its decentralized nature makes such fundamental changes difficult says xu bitcoin miners are unlikely to agree to something that would render their expensive hardware useless moreover bitcoin’s high valuation is a reflection of its mining costs which include energy says liu “like gold it is scarce because it is difficult and expensive to mine”an exterior view of a bitcoin mine near a hydropower station in rural sichuan province  liu xingzhepeople visuala manager stands near a wall of fans inside a bitcoin mine in rural sichuan province  liu xingzhepeople visualpolicy shiftsfor a while less developed regions eager for investment welcomed the cryptocurrency mines allowing them to register as data centers and providing discounts on electricity and land fees until february inner mongolia used an “inverted price ladder” for energyintensive industries the policy which attracted many bitcoin mines lowered the price of electricity the more a business consumedbut the winds have changed and the chinese government now wants to reduce energy use and related greenhouse gas emissions instead according to ’s figures  of inner mongolia’s electricity is generated from fossil fuels in the city ordos where li was located that figure is  with the central government looking to limit coal consumption powerhungry bitcoin mines are an obvious target says yang zhou china advisor at energy and climate policy think tank agora energiewende “because inner mongolia hadn’t adjusted how it supplied power it could only cut off demand to meet emissioncontrol targets” she sayswhat are the benefits of digital assets to the real economy we’re approaching this issue with caution  zhou xiaochuan officialguan dabo professor at tsinghua university and coauthor of the paper calculating bitcoin’s carbon footprint told sixth tone that to him the drawbacks of cryptocurrencies outweigh their benefits to the country’s prosperity “this emerging industry does not have much substantial contribution to the future national economy” guan says “as a financial derivative tool it consumes a lot of energy it may not be worth the gain”china’s policymakers seem to increasingly share guan’s doubts in april the municipal government of beijing told data centers involved in bitcoin mining to report their electricity consumption to inform future policy and announced it would tighten supervision and approval of data centers out of energy saving concerns an official said the excessive growth of data centers had “put pressure” on the city’s ability to control carbon emissions and meet power demand during peak periodschina’s central government has long been skeptical of cryptocurrencies already in  the central bank banned financial institutions from using and trading in bitcoin and similar currencies in  china shut down domestic cryptocurrency trading platforms and outlawed launches of new cryptocurrencies called initial coin offerings chinese people can still trade via foreign exchanges but at the risk of the policy climate becoming even stricter“chinese policy does not recognize the currency properties of bitcoin worrying that it might impact currency management and the financial system” says huang zhen director of the institute of financial law at central university of finance and economics “at present the only virtual currency recognized by china is the digital yuan” — which is backed by the people’s bank of china“what are the benefits of digital assets to the real economy we’re approaching this issue with caution” zhou xiaochuan former president of the people’s bank of china said at an international conference in april he compared cryptocurrencies to shadow banking and the speculative trading of derivatives that caused the  financial crisis “we need to be careful” he saidwhen it comes to cryptocurrency mining the central government is more ambiguous neither banning nor supporting such businesses this lack of clear guidance means local regulations can be unpredictable many miners for example sign contracts with smallscale hydropower dams and coalpowered plants both of which have been the subject of mass closure campaigns as a result li says miners focus on shortterm profits aware it might not be possible to bring longterm plans to fruitionli’s own experience is a case in point though he never expected inner mongolia to ban cryptocurrency mines outright the move was preceded by an inspection round in  targeting energyintensive mines taking advantage of electricity discounts and in august the suspension of  bitcoin mines from taking part in electricity trading meaning they could no longer enjoy preferential priceswhere to nextbitcoin mine investors tell sixth tone they expect the policy changes in inner mongolia to sooner or later be copied by other regions rich in coal and cryptocurrency mines their chief concern is xinjiang which according to cbeci is home to a third of the world’s bitcoin miningon thursday the central government gave bitcoin miners a potential first sign of things to come xinjiang was among seven provincelevel areas it reprimanded for failing to control energy intensity during the first quarter of the year urging them to “resolutely take down projects that don’t meet standards and that consume a lot of energy and cause a lot of emissions” it was essentially the same warning given to inner mongolia last yearwu jihan a leading bitcoin entrepreneur and cofounder of miningchip giant bitmain reminded fellow miners during an industry conference in april that they had to start using clean energy or risk institutions losing interest in “dirty” bitcoin “carbon neutrality has a longterm impact on the industry and reducing carbon emissions is a global trend” he said the conference celebrated the upcoming wet season a source of cheap electricity “hydropower” wu said “is the heirloom of the mining industry” — something to be treasured for generationsmany miners have placed their hopes — and computers — in two southwestern provinces rich in hydroelectric dams sichuan and yunnan because of a lack of infrastructure to send electricity long distances these dams often curtail their power — in sichuan the total stood at over  billion kwh for   of their total production and about twice the electricity used yearly by washington dc this has historically attracted energyintensive industries from chemical and aluminium plants to cryptocurrency minesmany miners focus on sichuan owing to a provincial policy in effect since  to support the blockchain industry with overcapacity hydropower for three years “sichuan has the most friendly policy toward bitcoin mining in china” says yang maohua who runs bitcoin mining operations in the provinceandrey rudakovbloomberg via people visualbut sichuan’s bitcoin mines have also come under scrutiny many operators of small dams in the province have made deals to supply cryptocurrency businesses with cheap electricity directly to the chagrin of stateowned power companies zhao lei general manager of a local state grid subsidiary said in may  that such deals violate electricity market order constitute tax evasion and pose safety issues a crackdown on illicit mines followedanother worry for sichuan’s miners is the rising price of electricity despite the ambiguous stance of chinese authorities the lure of profits is still pulling people into bitcoin competition has become fierce “last year aba’s electricity was cheap” says liu the bixin mining ceo referring to a sichuanese region rich in hydropower “but this year’s investment has overheated the electricity price has increased a lot” this year’s costs are  higher than last year according to the sichuan power exchange centermany in the industry argue cryptocurrency businesses absorbing sichuan’s excess hydropower are essentially green using environmentally friendly electricity that nobody would have used otherwise but the question is how long this argument will remain convincing if more miners are to stay in the province yearround fourfifths of sichuan’s hydropower is of the runoftheriver type meaning the dam has no reservoir that can store water for dry spells to meet power demand in drier winter months the province generates up to about a quarter of its power from fossil fuels and purchases electricity from other provincesthis dynamic means hydropower is ultimately not the solution to the question of how to make bitcoin environmentally friendly says alex de vries an economist and creator of website digiconomist in an article published  in scientific journal joule he points out that seasonal variation of hydropower requires alternative energy sources which in the worstcase scenario “presents an incentive for the construction of new coalfired power stations to fulfill this purpose”instabilities in electricity supply and demand as well as climate change also affect cryptocurrency mining operations outside winter in may  a delayed rainy season that reduced power production and caused higherthanaverage temperatures that increased air conditioner usage meant electricity was diverted for residential use miners had no choice but to shut down temporarily on sunday another power shortage forced the sichuan government to ration power again cutting off cryptocurrency mining businessesthis wet season could be the last good opportunity left for miners in china  patrick li bitcoin minerrising electricity costs and policy uncertainties are driving mining operations abroad bixin’s liu says with investors setting their eyes on north america central asia and eastern europebut sentiments toward cryptocurrency mines are souring elsewhere too concerned about miners’ power use and carbon footprint authorities in locales as varied as iran new york state and abkhazia an autonomous region north of georgia have in recent months cracked down on illegal operations proposed a moratorium on new mines or banned the practice altogether respectively citing the emissions caused by every transaction electric carmaker tesla said wednesday it would no longer accept bitcoinli says he will move his operations to sichuan for now but he’s unsure what will happen when the province’s preferential policy expires at the end of next year in the dry season limited power resources will make competition fierce he says“we estimated that this wet season would be the last good opportunity left for miners in china and that afterward there will be more uncertainties” li says “we are also looking for mining farms overseas seeking a more stable policy environment”editor kevin schoenmakersheader image a worker checks the equipment inside a bitcoin mine in rural sichuan province  liu
