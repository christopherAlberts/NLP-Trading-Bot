the team at bitooda a global digital asset financial technology and services platform offering risk management solutions “bestexecution” brokerage and market analysis has published their weekly hash report dated as mentioned in bitooda‘s report bitcoin btc “sold off  to  as of  midnight utc” the leading digital asset dropped “as low as  following tweets related to tesla no longer accepting bitcoin and potentially selling its btc stake” the report notedtesla said it was concerned about the bitcoin network’s excessive energy consumption transaction speeds and various other costs as noted by bitooda “to add to the noise elon musk stated tesla is still holding its btc”as acknowledged by bitooda“none of the arguments is new bitcoin is indeed energy intensive although a growing plurality of its energy usage is both renewablecarbonneutral and contributes to grid stabilization — which can help operators achieve renewable production goals — or flare mitigation purposes”although certain computing applications may and will eventually achieve similar “positive externalities” they’re not actually mature enough technologically yet the report addedit also mentioned that computing apps need high bandwidth and can’t be “easily rerouted as intermittent data centers come online and go offline unpredictably”bitooda pointed out that “storedenergy” solutions for “intermittent generation” are still in their early stages and “ultimately are a cost item not a revenue item”the report also noted“bitcoin is not green — but it is getting steadily greener hashrate or the amount of computing power securing the btc network has generally been  lower since the last reset on  tracking around  vs a target of  ehs”according to bitooda’s assessment this could be attributed to the chinese crypto miners “targeting their annual wet season migration from the northern coal region to the hydrorich sichuanyunnan regions for after the reset when lost production of btc  phs is substantially lower than during the last difficulty epoch”the report further noted“total btc earnings per phs are  mbtc down from  mbtc  phs last week  or millibtc   btc transaction fees rose  bps wow to  of miner rewards or  btc per block with moderate congestion levels in the ‘mempool”the bitooda report also mentioned that btc mining revenue fell to   phs per day and  because of the greater target hashrate “slightly” higher transaction tx fees and the lower bitcoin spot price the report added that “correspondingly the bitooda north american hash spread™ fell  wow from  to ”as explained by bitooda they define the bitooda hash spread™ as “the difference between the cost of power per mwh and the bitcoin mining revenue per mwh” according to bitooda this gives miners “a quick sense of the surplus generated by their business to cover personnel overhead depreciation and profit”bloomberg data reveals “a weighted average around the clock us wholesale industrial power price of   mwh leading to an aggregate spread of  across  power markets” the report noted while adding that oldergen  devices “saw their hash spread™ fall  to   mwh  devices the bulk of the installed base saw a hash spread of about   mwh”the report continued“the current target hashrate of  ehs implies  mwh power consumption per bitcoin mined using  rigs and substantially more using oldergeneration equipment this translates into  in power expense mining with  rigs it costs  using  rigs still a  margin excluding labor”the main takeaways from the bitooda report are as follows
