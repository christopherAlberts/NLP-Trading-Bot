antimoney laundering aml and the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign asset control’s ofac’s standardson march  marathon announced that it was launching the first bitcoin mining pool based in north america that is fully compliant with us regulations including aml and ofac’s standards the mining pool refrains from processing transactions from those listed on the us department of treasury’s specially designated nationals and blocked persons list sdn therefore ensuring all bitcoin mined by the pool is compliant with us regulatory standardson may  marathon began directing all of its hashrate to the new mining pool as a result all bitcoin that marathon produces from may  onwards will be produced in a manner that complies with us regulatory standards while marathon is the first usbased enterprise miner to point its miners towards this pool and to integrate these standards the pool will begin accepting other usbased bitcoin mining companies on june  “we’ve built marathon into one of the leading bitcoin miners in north america and we are always looking for innovative ways to improve on that position and to better our industry as a whole by enabling more institutions and individuals to participate” said fred thiel marathon’s ceo “the mining pool we recently launched is an archetype of our philosophy and approach to the industry today the majority of bitcoin’s global hashrate is concentrated in pools in a single country outside the united states and there is little regulatory oversight of how usbased miners process transactions we believe the concentration of mining pools and the lack of oversight pose potential risks to our industry“our pool proactively addresses both of these issues by shifting mining power back to north america we believe the network will become more decentralized and stronger as the risk of other governments interfering with the mining industry is reduced by excluding transactions between nefarious actors we can provide investors and regulators with the peace of mind that the bitcoin we produce is ‘clean’ ethical and compliant with regulatory standards we have spoken to many large funds and corporations who have expressed interest in purchasing bitcoin but who are concerned over the lack of ofac compliance it is our belief that the marathon ofac pool will help diminish these concerns these advancements are good for our business our shareholders and our industry and we look forward to enabling other miners to share in these benefits as the pool opens to new entrants in june”about ofacthe us department of the
