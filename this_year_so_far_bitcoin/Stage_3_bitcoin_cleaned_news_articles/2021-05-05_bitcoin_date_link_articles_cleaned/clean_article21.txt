while bitcoin is poised to revamp and upend global finance the massive power demands of its blockchain network could undermine the world’s efforts to keep global warming in checkcredit quote inspectorin february the bitcoin network consumed as much energy as argentina a country of  million people according to researchers at cambridge university by  if this trend continues cryptocurrency mining in china alone could use as much power as italy uses in a whole year the resulting  emissions would be equal to those of the czech republicincreasingly the energy and climate impact of bitcoin is compared to that of countries so what can be done about thatadvertisementsome analysts think this is fine research by ark investment management which holds a lot of crypto assets found that the bitcoin ecosystem consumes less than  of the energy required by the traditional banking systemhowever billions of people use traditional banking services whereas only one million bitcoin addresses are active on a daily basis according to coinmetrics data if the sector were to grow its consumption would also growget more science news like this join the zme newsletter for amazing science news

new industry the requirements for implementing early infrastructure are particularly intense so going forward each new bitcoin mined should use increasingly less energy and generate fewer carbon emissions — at least that’s the planadvertisementbut in any event the bottom line is that the bitcoin network eats up a lot of power and its appetite is only increasing in a new study recently published in nature researchers at the university of chinese academy of sciences in beijing have proposed some solutions that could perhaps mitigate some of the crypto network’s massive environmental footprintrather than taxing bitcoin mining as some have proposed earlier the chinese researchers claim a better strategy may be encouraging miners to shift their operations to regions that are powered by ‘green’ energydata from the cambridge study indicates chinese bitcoin mining is responsible for  of the network’s power north american miners make up roughly  of the global hash rate followed closely by miners in russia kazakhstan malaysia and irana bitcoin mining rig from  credit wikimedia commonsthere are a few reasons why china is dominating this space one explanation is that the chinese government was quick to offer subsidies for the mining industry chinese miners also have access to computer chips at a discount straight from the world’s most important manufacturers last but not least electricity in some of the most important mining provinces such as xinjiang is dirt cheap trading at least five times cheaper than in north america the price of bitcoin surged since  after millions of firsttime retail investors began purchasing crypto with their phones on apps like bitqt as well as a result of large institutional investors moving their assets away from stocks and bonds into the burgeoning crypto spacemuch of this energy is sourced from coal although a study estimated up to  of bitcoin miners use at least some renewable energy as part of their power supply including hydropower from china’s massive dams but overall much of the energy still comes from dirty sourcesshouyang wang one of the new report’s authors and chair professor at the academy of mathematics and systems science at the chinese academy of sciences in beijing wanted to see if there’s any way to make bitcoin mining operations both profitable and sustainable in the futurewang and colleagues performed simulations finding that if bitcoin mining is allowed to grow businessasusual it would peak in  at nearly  terawatthours of electricity or as much as a mediumsized country and generate nearly  million metric tons of carbon emissions since most of the mining would take place in china this would completely derail the country’s efforts to decarbonize its energy systemat its address to the  session of the un general assembly unga  in february chinese president xi jinping declared that china will ‘aim to have  emissions peak before  and achieve carbon neutrality before ’“it is important to note that the adoption of this disruptive and promising technique without  environmental concerns may pose a barrier to the worldwide effort on ghg emissions management in the near future” wang told forbes adding that the research team was “surprised by the energy consumption and carbon emission assessment results of bitcoin blockchain operation in china”the solution is moving from a punitive tax policy to a site regulation policy that motivates miners to move their operations in an area that guarantees a high rate of renewable energythe simulation showed that under such a policy only  of miners remained in coalintensive energy regions under the site regulation model the researchers found bitcoin operations generated  million metric tons at peak as opposed to  million tons under an additional taxation scenario“site regulation should be carried out by the government placing limitations on bitcoin mining in certain regions that use coalbased heavy energy” wang explained “that being said we think that there are enough benefits to this policy which will incentivize the miners to move their operation willingly for example since energy prices in cleanenergy regions of china are lower than that in heavyenergy regions the miners can effectively lower their individual energy consumption cost which would increase their profitability”the supply of new bitcoin halves every four years which also means the miners’ rewards get halved the next time this will happen will be  — this is the forecasted peak of bitcoin mining after  the authors of the new study believe that it will no longer be costeffective to mine bitcoin this is why competition is so fierce nowadays with miners buying every rig they can get their hands on so they mine as much as they can before this also means that at least partly the bitcoin network is selfregulating in time the network will use less and less energy and generate fewer carbon emissions but until it peaks regulators have their work cut out for them
