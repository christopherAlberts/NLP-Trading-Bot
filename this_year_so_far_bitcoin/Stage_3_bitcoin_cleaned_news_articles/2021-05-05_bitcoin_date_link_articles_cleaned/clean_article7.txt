jpmorgan chase nysejpm could become the biggest us bank to embrace cryptocurrency as an asset class as early as this summer with the launch of an actively managed bitcoin cryptobtc fund while reports of the banks plans and timelines have not been confirmed on the record by jpmorgan the sources seem to be consistent and credibleheres how jpmorgan is changing its tune on bitcoin and hopping on the btc fund bandwagon in a different way  and why it matters for crypto investorshow its happeningjpmorgan ceo jamie dimon has made his disdain for bitcoin no secret as recently as  dimon called bitcoin a fraud he even predicted that someone is going to get killed in its wake while dimon still isnt the cryptocurrencys biggest fan jpmorgan has since started planning a bitcoin fund for a limited number of its private wealth clients client demand for bitcoin has simply forced jpmorgan into action just as the bank predicted it would eventually do  despite its ceos opinionthe big difference between jpmorgans proposed bitcoin fund and most other existing or proposed bitcoin funds is active management this distinction means that jpmorgan will professionally manage the fund for a fee with the end goal of achieving higher returns than a straight investment in bitcoin or a passively managed bitcoin etf would attainin practice there is not much evidence that actively managed funds outperform passively managed funds the best quick illustration of this may be warren buffets big bet against the hedge fund industry  the famous investor bet a hedge fund manager that an sp  index fund ie a lowfee passively managed etf would outperform a portfolio of hedge funds ie highfee actively managed funds over a  period buffet won the betmost other bitcoin funds including wellknown grayscale investments massive bitcoin fund behave more like exchangetraded funds etfs meaning that their prices move in direct correlation with the market without fund management intervention jpmorgan would have to time the market incredibly well to prove that its active management of bitcoin can outperform its passive market counterpartswhen its happeninggrayscale and other newly proposed etfs from major us banks are caught in a race for sec approval to be the first american bitcoin etf canadas recently approved bitcoin etf and the involvement of bigname us banks in etf applications have put pressure on the sec and raised expectations for approval in the near futureso why the rush for a bitcoin etf anyway simply put they are easier and more convenient than a direct investment in bitcoin especially for investors who are not totally comfortable in a crypto exchange with a bitcoin etf an individual can invest in the asset through their traditional market exchange without worrying about complex security issues like protecting digital wallet passwords unfortunately early investors in bitcoin have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in digital wallets with forgotten passwordsjpmorgan does not seem to expect any regulatory trouble launching its fund by this summer meanwhile the sec has delayed any decisions on bitcoin etfs until this summer at the earliest setting any and all bitcoin etfs most likely behind jpmorgans fund in timelinewhy it mattersif all goes as planned jpmorgans fund will be the first actively managed bitcoinspecific fund this is an objectively unprecedented exciting move in the bitcoin world however whether an actively managed bitcoin fund will be more costefficient than a direct investment or etf investment is yet to be determinedi predict that it will be more costefficient for almost all investors to buy bitcoin directly or through a nofee etf and keep an eye on its price fluctuations while jpmorgan hasnt revealed any fee structure yet actively managed funds usually involve steep costs compared to etfs or direct investments because the funds manage the buying and selling of several different assets  not just oneactive management of bitcoin as opposed to active management of an entire portfolio of varied cryptocurrency assets is a unique and new concept in the crypto market but this doesnt necessarily mean it will outperform more varied actively managed crypto funds or even bitcoin itself still the funds existence will be important for the overall maturity of the crypto marketif i were to buy more btc i would likely do it before this summer with a plan to hold for the long term since bitcoin etf approvals are likely to make headlines and increase trading volume the approval of these funds from major banks and the ensuing heightened demand for bitcoin will likely raise the cryptos price in the long run spurring further acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class with that said the crypto market is unpredictable and notoriously volatile as always only invest an amount that youre willing to lose in risky cryptocurrency assets
