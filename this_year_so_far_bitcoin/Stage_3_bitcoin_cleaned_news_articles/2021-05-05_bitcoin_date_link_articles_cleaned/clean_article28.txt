closing lost ln channels using only a wallet seed also included are our regular sections with announcements of releases and release candidates plus notable changes to popular bitcoin infrastructure softwareaction itemsminers encouraged to start signaling for taproot miners who expect to be willing to enforce the new consensus rules for taproot are encouraged to begin signaling and to ensure they’ll be able to run bitcoin core  described below or other compatible taprootenforcing software by the minimum activation block specified in anyone wanting to trustlessly monitor signaling progress can upgrade to bitcoin core  and use the getblockchaininfo rpc for example the following command line prints the number of blocks in the current retarget period the number of those blocks which have signaled and whether it’s possible for taproot to activate in this period assuming there’s no reorg bitcoincli getblockchaininfo  jq   elapsedcountpossiblefalseif you prefer a graphical representation with supplementary information about miner progress and don’t need to use your own node we recommend taprootwatch by hampus sjöbergnewsclosing lost channels with only a  seed as described in newsletter  lloyd fournier proposed a method for creating new channels that would allow a user who lost all information except for their  wallet seed to rediscover their peers using only public information about the ln network once the user found their peers they could request the peers close their mutual channels using the  data loss protection protocol see newsletter  the proposed method isn’t perfect—users should still create  and replicate them across independent systems—but fournier’s proposal provides additional redundancy that would be especially useful for everyday userstwo weeks ago rusty russell restarted the thread after trying to specify and implement the idea after some additional mailing list discussion with fournier and a group conversation in the weekly ln protocol development meeting russell indicated he was leaning against the idea saying “i see encrypted backups as a morelikelytobeimplemented solution though because they’re useful to send to places other than peers and they can also contain htlc information if you want” being able to contain htlc information would allow settling payments that were pending at that time which is a capability no recovery mechanism based solely on a  seed could providereleases and release candidatesnew releases and release candidates for popular bitcoin infrastructure projects please consider upgrading to new releases or helping to test release candidatesbitcoin core  is a new version of bitcoin core that contains activation logic for the proposed taproot soft fork taproot uses schnorr signatures and allows the use of tapscript these are respectively specified by bips   and  also included is the ability to pay  addresses specified by  although bitcoins spent to such addresses on mainnet will not be secure until activation of a soft fork using such addresses such as taproot the release additionally includes bug fixes and minor improvementsnote due to a problem with the certificate authority that provides the code signing certificates for the windows versions of bitcoin core users on windows will need to click through an extra prompt to install it is expected that there will be a  release with an updated certificate when the problem is fixed if you are planning to upgrade anyway there’s no reason to delay using  because of this problemnote due to a problem with the certificate

this selfhosted payment processing software it includes lightning loop support adds  as a twofactor authentication option makes various ui improvements and marks a switch to using semantic versioning for version numbers moving forwardnotable code and documentation changesnotable changes this week in bitcoin core clightning eclair lnd rustlightning  hardware wallet interface hwi rust bitcoin btcpay server bitcoin improvement proposals bips and lightning boltsbitcoin core  is the next pr in the multiprocess project and adds the ability for the bitcoinnode process to spawn other processes and communicate with them using cap’n proto these features are currently only used for testing but the next pr in the project will allow bitcoin core to be started in multiprocess mode with the bitcoincore process spawning separate bitcoinwallet and bitcoingui processesbitcoin core  nearly completes the coin statistics index project to dramatically speed up the gettxoutsetinfo rpc until now the rpc defaulted to scanning the full utxo set every time it was called making it difficult for users to continually and quickly verify the coin supply or compare utxo set hashes between different nodes users can now start their nodes with the coinstatsindex configuration option to begin building the coin statistics index in the background once it is synced gettxoutsetinfo runs nearly instantly and users can specify a height or block hash for the statistics being able to get the statistics for a particular block will be especially useful for allowing community verification of assumeutxo chainstate archivesbitcoin core  removes the rewindblockindex logic triggered when updating a presegwit node  or older to a segwitenforcing version presegwit nodes only processed stripped blocks that lacked the segregated witness data the rewindblockindex logic discarded its copies of such blocks redownloaded them in their complete form and validated them using segwit’s rules as presegwit nodes have been endoflife since  the scenario has become uncommon future releases will instead prompt the user to reindex for an equivalent outcomelnd  builds on previous work to add support for making spontaneous atomic multipath payments amps by manually specifying payment parameters to the sendpayment rpc invoking sendpayment with an amp invoice is expected to be implemented in followup prsrustlightning  only allows accepting a payment if it includes a payment secret payment secrets are created by the receiver and included in invoices the spender includes the payment secret in their payment in order to prevent attempts by third parties to reduce the privacy of multipath payments alongside this change are several api changes designed to reduce the chance that a payment will be accepted incorrectlybips  updates the  specification of taproot with activation parameters based on the speedy trial proposal see newsletter footnotesthe data loss protection protocol and other proposed methods such as covert requests for mutual channel closes requires your channel peer to still be online and responsive if they’ve become permanently unavailable and you don’t have a backup your funds are permanently lost if instead you recover from a backup you might still lose all of your funds if you broadcast an old state but you have a chance to recover your funds if you backed up the latest state or if your peer doesn’t contest an old statefind the original post hereplease subscribe to the bitcoin optech newsletter directly to receive this content straight to your inbox every
