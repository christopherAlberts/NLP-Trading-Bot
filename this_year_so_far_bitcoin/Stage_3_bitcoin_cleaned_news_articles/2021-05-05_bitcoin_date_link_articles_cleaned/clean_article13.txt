although they may seem threatening bans on bitcoin have never worked and will continue to be circumvented by the networkworried about a ban then you need bitcoin more than you thinkskeptics often argue that governments will ban bitcoin when it becomes too important and threatens national sovereignty at least these critics understand bitcoin’s importance and the power that state currency monopolies exert over us what they fail to understand is the power of distributed opensource technologies and the game theory faced by governments when making these decisions tldr bans are ineffective—they merely cede global technological power to peers authoritarian governments are more inclined to attempt regressive regulations if you live under that type of regime you need bitcoin more than you thinkyou cannot ban bitcoin—you can only ban yourself from bitcoinselfregulation is the most important component of distributed opensource technologies like bitcoin the bitcoin supply is preprogrammed with a hard limit of  million units blocks are mined every  minutes on average miners are rewarded with new bitcoin supply growth halves every  years anyone can view and validate transactions by running a node and no one can be censored from the network if they have internet access and abide by the consensus rules these principles remain intact no matter what you i or regulators think a government can attempt to ban its citizens from using the network but bitcoin will continue to run on the internet the securities exchange commission’s hester peirce made this point recently when she concluded that “governments would be foolish to ban bitcoin”bans are ineffective and potentially impossibleeven if a government were to ban bitcoin it would be ineffective the us government banned alcohol under prohibition but liquor was widely available during that time bitcoin is not even a physical entity so how do governments intend to seize it it is excruciatingly difficult to ban people from using code on the internet ask china—they tried to ban facebook but chinese still access facebook via vpns there are even question marks about the legality of any potential bitcoin ban in the us because bitcoin is ultimately code which could be a protected category of free speech under the first amendmentglobal regulatory competition raises the stakesa bitcoin ban would be foolish and ineffective but governments could certainly increase the barriers to entry and increase friction regulators can implement knowyourcustomer and antimoney laundering requirements or raise taxes which would likely slow adoption however it is difficult to believe that governments could execute remarkably stricter policies on bitcoin relative to other financial assets although governments have previously overstepped the boundaries with  there is little precedent for being able to do so nor incentive with bitcoin furthermore if they did would they be willing to bear the consequences do the world’s leading powers want to turn away from this powerful technology when others embrace it republican policymaker kevin mccarthy commented on this geopolitical tradeoff in a recent interviewus policymakers are concerned about the possibility of ceding the initiative to china this type of regulatory competition has pushed miami mayor francis suarez to embrace bitcoin as he encourages techsavvy capital to his cityperhaps positive bitcoin regulation is just as likely as negative regulationcoordination is unlikely in a multipolar worlda ban would be more impactful if all countries were to coordinate and implement it simultaneously however what is the probability of global coordination in the fractious world of geopolitics the uk is too busy arguing with the eu and the us bickering with china for them all to clamp down simultaneously on bitcoin marko papic’s multipolar worldview that he outlined in his recent book “geopolitical alpha” strengthened my conviction that the geopolitical conditions that would be necessary for a globally coordinated clampdown on bitcoin do not existregulators are warming to the techturning from macro to micro factors are governments willing to destroy bitcoin companies within their own borders if we think about the jobs at coinbase gemini and other companies we realize that bitcoin is becoming entrenched particularly in the world’s largest economy exchanges exist in most countries worldwide corporations hold bitcoin on their balance sheets the chicago mercantile exchange offers bitcoin futures and people in the us congress are outright supporters of btc in recent weeks exus regulators have joined both binance and blockfi which highlights a growing relationship between bitcoinrelated businesses and the government there is a high probability that many politicians hold bitcoin themselvesi suspect that bitcoin holders have a stronger more organized and vocal lobbying group than their opponentsmillennials might demand financial empowermentmost countries have adopted a waitandsee approach because they do not know exactly how to approach bitcoin technology they hope that innovation jobs and economic growth will emerge and they argue that the industry is too small to present a real threat but the longer they wait the more entrenched the industry becomes and the less likely negative regulation is this factor becomes more meaningful if one considers millennials’ rise to economic and political prominencethe fall  blockchain capital survey reveals  of millennials will likely purchase bitcoin in the next  years vs only  for the  age category millennialsare three times more likely to hold cryptocurrency than their parents because they are more familiar with new technologies and are comfortable with intangible assets and probably view the asset as their opportunity to create a sounder financial future with each passing year this generation moves closer to the seat of political power at the very least they become a consideration of votehungry politiciansblockchain capitalperhaps you need bitcoin more than you thinkineffective yes unlikely yes however a bitcoin ban is still possiblegovernments that ban new technologies tend to take on a certain character though such governments aretend to be more authoritarian and less supportive of individual liberties like those of china and venezuela it is in these countries where people need bitcoin the most venezuelans do not care what the government says—they need bitcoin to protect themselves from hyperinflation afghanis and belarusians need access to digital bank accounts to liberate themselves from their oppressive governments turkey and nigeria are both great recent examples of places where bitcoin becomes a need and a must in the past month erdogan’s turkish government announced measures to stop merchants from accepting bitcoin and nigeria clamped down on exchanges in response interest in bitcoin has shot through the roof in both countriesturkey and nigeria were already bitcoin hotspots because people in those countries know that their government does not protect the value of currency the us dollar has gained  and  against the turkish lira and nigerian naira respectively since  it is telling that these government measures to control bitcoin have not dampened interest in itthe moral of the story is that if you think your government is going to ban bitcoin then you need it more than you thinkat some point governments might become threatened by the bitcoin ecosystem it is understandable that the possibility of looming regulation is a barrier for potential investors however if we dig into the potential scenarios we figure out that the government’s and your most effective responses to bitcoin are the same to embrace it in this scenario the governments can at least attempttry to extract as much tax revenue from the burgeoning industry as possible unless governments can muster renewed global coordination bans are foolish only the most regressive governments will prevent their citizens from interacting with this powerful technology and people’s need for bitcoin is the strongest in those countries each individual needs to decide where they sit on this spectrum but do not take too long to make your decision the stakes are too high and the opportunity too great to allow the regulatory threat to prevent action altogetherthis is a guest post by rob price opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of btc
