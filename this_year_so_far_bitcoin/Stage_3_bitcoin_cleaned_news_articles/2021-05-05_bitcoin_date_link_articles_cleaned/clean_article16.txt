does bitcoin squander energy no – it actually consumes wasted power that is often green finance specialist pascal huegli writes for finewscomundeniable bitcoin uses tons of energy but this shouldn’t be taken as a point of contention we need to ask whether there is any point in using so much of it for bitcoin and look at where it comes frompascal huegli finance expert and lecturer at the university of applied sciences in business administration zurichthose who don’t see a point to bitcoin easily call the power it consumes a waste but when you take the other side are there any arguments for bitcoin any that justify the energy expenditurethe idea of linking money with energy is nothing new many smart people have tried before bitcoin was around henry ford at the start of the  century argued for an energy currency he believed that such a currency couldn’t be as easily controlled as gold then was every country would issue currency based on their natural resourcesthe american architect and inventor r buckminster fuller also took up the argument when he defined wealth as energy he even forecast that there would be a scientific accounting system blockchain perhaps that would keep the books on the wealth createdbitcoin converts power safelythe energy currency they imagined has existed since  bitcoin exactly fulfils henry ford’s definition he envisaged a currency based on kilowatt hours kwh – which is what bitcoin does the cryptocurrency is covered by a socalled proofofwork new bitcoins are issued against work performed from miningwhen miners make greater efforts then it becomes harder and more expensive for the individual miner to get new bitcoins at least according to bitcoin protocols the network really follows a simple equation the more energy bitcoin absorbs the more secure and dependable it isbut it is possible for bitcoin to become too secure and consume more energy than necessary the cryptocurrency is still in its early stages and new miners are still attracted because of the benefits they see in the long term energy consumption is likely to be based more on transaction volumes and the cost effectiveness of bitcoin’s security and energy consumption relative to market capitalization should increasecheaper electricitybitcoin’s decentralized character is a large advantage miners can operate anywhere and they don’t depend on specific buyers or sellers they are in a highly competitive environment and it is likely that they are on the hunt for cheaper sources of energy often they consume stranded assets that can’t find any takersthe bitcoin miners come into play in taking the energy that no one or very few people want mostly in china and mainly in the xinjiang inner mongolia sichuan and yunnan provinces the first two are rich in coal while the last ones have giant hydroelectric dams all have relatively low population densities and large energy resourcesminers don’t take anythingthere are no exact numbers but it is likely that bitcoin used up energy in these provinces that would either be wasted or not generated at all it is disingenuous to say that bitcoin steals large amounts of electricity from other usesminers also look for cheap sources of energy outside china in the us there are companies that trap surplus natural gas for bitcoin mining in that way methane is captured and used to generate electricity and not released into the atmosphere as waste it doesn’t compete with households and industries for resourcesincentivized minerswithout bitcoin the energy would never be monetized trapped or utilized instead methane – a gas that is more damaging than  to the environment – would simply be released into the atmosphereestimates show that several hundredterawatt hours of energy are not produced because there is no demand in future bitcoin may consume more of this kind of energy because of the incentives that drive miners – together with the economics of stranded energy resourcespascal huegli is head of research for schlossbergco wealth and a lecturer at the university of applied sciences in business administration in zurich he is also the author of «insight defi» a germanlanguage newsletter on bitcoin and cryptocurrency news events and opportunities
