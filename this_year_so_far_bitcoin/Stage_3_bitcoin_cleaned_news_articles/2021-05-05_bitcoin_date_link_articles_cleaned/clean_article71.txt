by developers who are now working on a second testnet to be launched as early as next week“ is still just a  interop test we can spin up more later after testing and sync improvements” said ethereum foundation researcher diederik loerakker better known as protolambda in a discord chat room “good work everyone on this first  though we made a lot of progress in testnet setup and client integration”next steps for eth the larger goal will be to activate a working testnet between various ethereum and eth  software clients that not only activates pos but also the technology of sharding sharding is a way of splitting up the processing load for transaction data across multiple networks in ethereum’s case the plan is to create  subnetworks also known as “shards”functionality for sharding will be added to the third and fourth testnets that developers are working toward creating in the next few weeks as the scaling ethereum hackathon wraps upas detailed in a previous valid

project at the scaling ethereum hackathon expect to have launched two more testnets in addition to steklo each more featurecomplete and durablein a presentation at scaling ethereum loerakker said work on rayonism will continue even after the hackathon until developers are completely satisfied that code specifications for merging ethereum and eth  are secure“what we have  ethereum is a huge amount like basically one of the biggest decentralized exchanges  all the dapps there’s a whole super large ecosystem and we should protect it so … after the hackathon as well – it’s not going to be a hackathon forever – we move towards production with iteration” said loerakkerongoing progress on rayonism has certain members of the ethereum community expectant that the energyintensive activity of
