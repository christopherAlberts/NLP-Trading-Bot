are bitcoin’s esg credentials impacting its popularityhow bitcoin stacks up from an esg perspective is becoming an increasing concern for investors after a coal mine shutdown in xinjiang shone a light on the cryptocurrency’s operationsnews of the coalmine’s twoday shutdown sent the price of bitcoin tumbling  as the digital asset’s global computing power was cut by a thirdanalysis by coinshares noted flows into digital assets in the week ending  april slowed to their lowest level since october  as bitcoin mining issues in xinjiang saw assets under management aum drop  down to europe’s most popular crypto etp the btcetc bitcoin exchange traded crypto btce also took a hit last week having claimed  of all bitcoin etp flows in  btce saw  outflows in the week to  april according to data from ultumus this exodus is equivalent to more than a fifth of new assets gathered during the first three months of the yearbitcoin – and the etps tracking its performance – booked record outflows as the asset’s average hash rate fell  during the week of the xinjiang mine incident with the region accounting for almost half of the bitcoin mining networkdespite a subsequent recovery in the crypto’s price the mining mishap has done little to silence critics raising questions about bitcoin’s environmental social and governance esg credentials while accustomed to distrust regulators its ability to address these concerns may be crucial for bitcoin’s ability to withstand public scrutiny going forwardshow green can bitcoin beon the often prioritised ‘e’ criteria scores of commentators pressure groups analysts and researchers have lined up to condemn bitcoin’s energy consumptionaccording to the university of cambridge centre for alternative finance ccaf coal power accounts for two thirds of the energy used in the ‘proof of work’ process central to bitcoin’s secure production processthis is a problem given this process is essentially a race between different miners who have to verify  worth of transactions – also known as a hashing puzzle – as fast as possible with a participant’s portion of the total mining power on a network correlating to their probability of finding the solution before their competitorsin turn a vicious cycle has ensued between an increasing number of competitive miners and the use of more powerful and energyintensive graphics processing units gpus and applicationspecific integrated circuits asics by participants trying to outpace oneanotherat present research from the bank of america notes the carbon emissions associated with bitcoin are equal to that of greece while the cambridge bitcoin electricity consumption index said the bitcoin network consumes more energy in a year than countries such as the netherlands argentina and the united arab emiratesrefuting these analyses chris bendiksen head of research at coinshares said “the environmental concerns around mining are overblown and the analytical frameworks employed on the topic tend to range from nonsensical to outright disingenuous“to the extent that financial firms need to improve on the sustainability of cryptocurrency products this can be achieved for example by purchasing carbon credits at the custodial level to offset the current carbon impact of mining per coin held in custody per unit time“so far we have seen limited specific demand for such offsets and to my knowledge no large custodians currently offer them but it may well become a common product component”bendiksen also agreed with other analysis that bitcoin miners are mobile and seek to access the cheapest and often most freely supplied energy sources – and this is not necessarily limited to coal for instance during the rainy seasons in countries such as china and the democratic republic of congo miners will often rely on hydroelectricity while these sources are producing cheap poweraccording to bendiksen bitcoin miners are far from using renewables exclusively but he states that on average the crypto’s clean energy reliance is between double and quadruple the global residential commercial and industrial averageregarding scope for further decarbonisation of the world’s most popular digital currency innovations such as the  blockchainbacked carbon credit will help as will further regulatory pressure though this latter point will still create tension given crypto backers’ defensiveness about the asset class’s decentralised if waning naturesocial and governance concerns deserve credence‘s’ and ‘g’ considerations also require attention with many attributing the april selloff to news that the us treasury was opening an investigation into fresh accounts of money laundering being facilitated by digital assetsalongside being used to launder dirty money bitcoin trading also has a track record of security concerns such as the half a billiondollar mt gox hack of  and unwitting individuals being duped by online ponzi schemes advertising ‘get rich quick’ bitcoin investing on platforms such as twitteroutside of criminal activity the complexity and high volatility of assets such as bitcoin has prompted regulators such as the uk’s financial conduct authority and the swedish financial supervisory authority to deem crypto etps unfit for use by retail investors with the former issuing a direct plea to consumers addressing this exact issueunconvinced by these concerns bendiksen responded “there are no other assets that come even remotely close to bitcoin’s ability to promote and protect human rights and aid in the global struggle for freedom“its governance is also unique in its ability to resist corruption and promote transparency”certainly the blockchain technology underpinning bitcoin is now being applied in the backoffice functions of trusted financial institutions and central banks are even toying with the idea of national crypto currenciesas for esg a virtual ledger could assist with labourintensive tasks such as supply chain traceability renewable energy distribution antimoney laundering and proxy votinghowever as for bitcoin itself it still has a way to go before regulators cease to perceive it as a threat to unsophisticated prospective investors likewise the unregulated and decentralised qualities which make it popular can also see victims of fraud or investment loss without recourse should things awrythough esg concerns may not be a deterrent to cryptos’ libertarian vanguard the increasing importance of these issues in the professional investment community may mean bitcoin will have to answer its critics if it is to enjoy the tailwinds of further institutional adoptionbendiksen concluded “so far we have not seen any evidence of esg concerns actually impacting etp flows but we have had the issue raised on numerous occasions by prospective investors”further reading
