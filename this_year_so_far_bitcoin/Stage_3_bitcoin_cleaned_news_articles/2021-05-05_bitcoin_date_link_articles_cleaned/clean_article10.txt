bitcoin remains one of the hottest topics of debate in the financial world and beyond the cryptocurrency also soared recently as companies like tesla begin investing in and accepting bitcoin as a form of payment visa recently announced support for bitcoin trades through custodian banks in a new pilot joining square’s cash app and paypal in offering bitcoin trading through their preexisting brand servicesalong with mastercard these companies are offering bank cards that allow users to spend crypto balances and some even offer cashback or cryptoback awards we define these types of services as cedefi or centralised decentralised financein this new world maturing defi apps are set to be embraced by traditional centralised cefi financial companies such as visa and mastercard what we then see is cedefi  the blended offering of bringing together the best of a centralised and decentralised finance systemsin practice this means the meeting of old school regulatory protections offered by the older and more traditional companies with the new school innovative financial infrastructure and products for example we know that bitcoin  other digital assets can be used for collaterising loans and borrowings rather than sit around as a stored value like goldhardly a revolutionhowever there are sceptics wary of this cedefi ‘revolution’ these card and payment company offerings are welcome in theory as they increase the technical rails between consumers businesses and blockchains and help us all prepare for a move to future payment infrastructure however in practice these offerings come from cefi companies who currently earn their money by charging transaction fees for settlement payment services and clearingthe scepticism can therefore be justified as they look to blockchain payments the latter execute peertopeer transactions that eliminate central intermediaries and associated bank fees users are fairly left to wonder if in the future they will have to pay these centralised services higher or further transaction fees for moving cryptocurrency across blockchain networks therefore defeating the promise of blockchainan alternativemany users are now looking for an offering that we haven’t yet seen in the market as the below suggestions detaillow cost onchain payments using stablecoin pegged to fiat currencyeasily accessible applications for executing stablecoin paymentslower payment acceptance fees than exist today in the card networkstransparent real time stablecoin payments and settlements on blockchain tied to underlying information supporting the paymentcard brand and bank protections for stablecoin funds sitting off chain in partner bank accountsin this situation the alternative payment company or card brand would issue such a stablecoin customer could use for transacting on blockchains stablecoin payments would be tied to the underlying records so for example what was purchased and would be transparent and real time on the blockchainthe payment companies or card brands would provide the on and off ramps for payors and payees which would add functionality to the ramps already in place today but would not actually be involved in the payment that would occur on the blockchainthe issuing and acquiring sides would take advantage of current card brand services eg on boarding protections for balances risk management etc but the payees and merchants would not incur the transaction fees currently associated with actual card payment transactionsthis may seem unsustainable from a revenue perspective for the card brands in question but they could still earn money from on and off ramp valueadded services and from interest on the reserves underlying the stablecoinstechnology is not the obstaclethe recent announcement from visa is overall welcome in the industry but the bottom line is that bitcoin is too volatile to be used for payments and we don’t see high adoption of bitcoin payments until its price stabilizeshowever there is a clear need for stablecoin payments on blockchains this is a value proposition that card brands and alternatives can offer along with the valueadded risk management cash management onboarding and more that are consolidated with existing fiat currency servicessome may argue that this precludes payment companies and card brands from earning fees as they do today but that is fundamentally what blockchain payments are all about – removing the need for central clearing and moving to a peer to peer structurewhilst some centralised financial services may not want to embrace the spirit of blockchain they may find their hand forced as alternative emerging stablecoin payment networks are more than likely set to fill the market need even if legacy companies don’t catch up
