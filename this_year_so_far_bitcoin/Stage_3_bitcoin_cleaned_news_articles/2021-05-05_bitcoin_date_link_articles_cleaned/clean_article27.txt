researchers at carnegie mellon university are warning that sharp price swings and liquidations could disproportionately impact smaller traders as the market for crypto derivatives boomsa recent study by the pittsburghbased carnegie mellon university’s cylab found trading volume in cryptocurrency derivatives exceeds that of the underlying spot markets“sophisticated actors are taking from amateur investors” kyle soska a researcher at the lab who coauthored the report said in an interview “wealth centralization is taking place and there are a few big players”liquidation events occur when traders cannot fulfill margin requirements for holding crypto derivative positions and often exacerbate price moves in april bitcoin futures had a record  billion worth of liquidations in one day after data showed leveraged traders were excessively skewed bullish the liquidation coincided with a near  drop in btc from an alltime high of around “when markets are trending up everybody makes money but during a wipeout a few big actors take everything and the little guys are taken out” soska saidsubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policytraders who take on smaller contract sizes are typically more longbiased or betting on bullish price movements according to the study the short side of the trade typically consists of hedgers who own spot market bitcoin or cryptocurrency miners who want to manage revenue volatility by locking in prices for a specific delivery date in the futurethat means traders who have short positions in the derivatives market are more likely to be priceneutral in terms of their overall positions making the btc futures market more of a speculative netlong play according to soska“this is why there is a distinct asymmetry with long positions that are more leveraged with small position sizes” soska saidthe researchers analyzed trading activity on bitmex a derivatives exchange launched in  that trades over  billion worth of volume per day on average the exchange allows users to go long or short bitcoin with leverage of up to  times often shorthanded as “” according to the report“we focused on bitmex because  the only player back in  and remained relevant for a long period of time” said soskain october the us commodity futures trading commission cftc charged bitmex with executing futures transactions on an unregistered board as well as other counts “in an attempt to evade us regulations” according to the cftc legal filingthe number of customer deposit addresses that received funds onchain in a rolling  approximately  window a significant drop is seen in  as bitmex sparred with us regulators source cylabwhen contacted by coindesk for comment a spokesperson for  group the holding structure for bitmex pointed to a statement the exchange had provided to the researchers in advance of publication in which exchange executives took issue with some parts of the draft“the paper contains various inaccurate andor misleading statements that do not properly reflect the platform’s structure and operations” according to that november statement which was included in the final reportin an email the spokesperson wrote that while “higher leverage is available we’ve historically seen the majority of traders opt to use lower leverage with the notional weighted average leverage being under ”stats about the size of bitmex and crypto derivatives trading source cylabthe cylab report suggests that crypto derivatives through excessive leverage and cascading liquidations are supportive of rapid price jumps that have been commonplace in bitcoin“this raises concerns about the impact that derivatives have on bitmex’s customers and on the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole” the researchers wrotecrichton said the researchers were led to the topic in part because of the growing stature of cryptocurrency markets in global financein  carnegie mellon university announced a partnership with ripple a global payment network using blockchain technology to fund academic research on cryptocurrencies cylab also published a companion website with realtime analytics of bitmex data and said it encourages collaboration across the crypto research community“crypto has gained a lot more attraction in the academic world in terms of being a more legitimized thing” soska said
