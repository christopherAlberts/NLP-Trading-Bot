you’ve been writing to me a lot lately wondering about bitcoin what is this technology what is it used for should you get involvedas of this writing a bitcoin costs roughly  up from  a year ago could it go to  sure why not  sounds greatthat’s not a predictionwhat do i think is the right price for bitcoin i’d say roughly zero but it could take a while to get therenow blockchain — the innovative technology of which bitcoin is the bestknown example — may have real uses i’m open to that idea blockchain allows for anonymous transactions that can be verified between parties who neither know nor trust each other theoretically blockchain obviates the need for government regulation or thirdparty verificationapplied to money bitcoin using blockchain technology theoretically allows us to remove transactions from the purview or limitations of existing financial infrastructuredollars the theory goes involve pesky government issuers unreliable central banks and the meddling institutions of the existing global finance system to its proponents bitcoin is like money unshackled from politics regulators and bordersto be clear i totally disagree with the need for unshackling i think dollars are awesome i even buy products and services with them i’ve honestly never felt limited by dollars except obviously by the amount of them that i control at any given time by contrast i believe bitcoins are — at their essence — useless a useless fiction and therefore a fraud i prefer my fictions to be usefulwhat is the realworld use of bitcoinbitcoin is not a useful store of value in the way that dollars are anything that can soar  percent in the past year as bitcoin has can also drop  percent the following year or the following month that makes it entirely inappropriate for “storing value”can bitcoin be delightful as a pure gamble like buying a lottery ticket sure but no sensible person advocates lottery tickets as a store of valuethe south sea company was created by charter in  with a mandate to engage in an implausible business in a far off place that none of its british investors had ever seen it was just exotic and mysterious enough to capture the whiff and elan of possibly unlimited wealth it enjoyed the imprimatur of the government of england and for a time legitimately traded in english government bonds shares began at  pounds reaching  pounds a decade later fortunes were destroyed shortly thereafter when the laws of financial gravity returned we return to this cautionary financial story over and over because while no two bubbles are alike history does rhymebitcoin has all the makings of collective financial madness magical thinking a difficulttograsp technology breathless media coverage of its everincreasing price celebrities might be buying itbitcoin’s only plausible realworld use cases — as a medium of exchange rather than a speculation — are tax evasion drug dealing prostitution child pornography assassinations armsdealing illegal gambling and ransomware for computer hackers as i have yet to engage in any of these activities i have yet to find an actual use for bitcoin in my own lifeincidentally bitcoin is probably not even anonymous one of the features of the blockchain is that all transactions are traceable and reproducible that’s the plausible key to blockchain technology’s usefulness in the future — that all transactions create a permanent record visible to all counterpartiesbut that feature of permanence undermines anonymity a blockchainsophisticated fbi should be able to see exactly who sold you bitcoin and who you in turn sold bitcoin to your drug deal or tax evasion with bitcoin was not as anonymous as you thought it was haven’t you ever watched movies this is neither business nor legal advice but do you know what is really anonymous a suitcase full of unmarked nonsequential dollar billsshould you take my word for it on bitcoin i can only warn you about my similarly strong feelings in the past and how that worked outin the one and only market call i have ever made in this space in  years i said tesla was a terrible stock in it promptly quadrupled in value so i reiterated my hatred for that stock’s price in my bold call clearly triggered the value of that stock to septuple over this past year you’re welcomei’m just saying don’t look to me if you’re itching to speculatebitcoin is far far stupider than tesla shares will ever be naturally tesla announced last month that it had speculated with its corporate cash by acquiring  billion in bitcoin because lols and yolo and fomotesla ceo elon musk’s explanation “bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money the key word is ‘almost’”ah yes such wisdom what mysterious sagacity from ’s newest richest man in the world take all my money please you carnivalbarking promoter of fictionsnever underestimate the power of greed and magical thinking to keep things irrational longer than you can stay solvent welcome to the monkey housecryptocurrency enthusiasts like to point out that traditional “fiat” money like dollars unmoored from a metallic base like silver or gold is based on a collective fiction in that sense wouldbe sophisticates and musk argue the collective fiction of bitcoin is no worse than dollarsgold is also a collective fiction albeit one that’s a few thousand years old shells have made for a collective fiction in the past the rai stones of micronesia were a collective fiction what is money anywayus dollars are also a collective fiction except for the fact that my government demands and accepts dollars for taxes as far as i can tell this is the basis for fundamental value in a currency — what my government accepts in taxesa convenient currency is more useful than barter my local state and federal governments do not currently accept extremely wellreasoned and delightfully funny finance writing as a means of discharging my tax obligations i need to first convert finance columns to dollars which my government then does acceptwhen president elon musk declares in  that we can and must make tax payments in bitcoin then — and only then — will i agree that bitcoin has any fundamental value it may well go to  and beyond in the meantime for all i knowuntil musk runs for president i expect a zero value future for this particular collective fictionmichael taylor is a columnist for the san antonio expressnews and
