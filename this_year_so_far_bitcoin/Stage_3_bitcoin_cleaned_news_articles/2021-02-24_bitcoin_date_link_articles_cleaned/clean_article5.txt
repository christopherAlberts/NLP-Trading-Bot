international disputes including lucasfilm ltd vs ainsworth also known as the star wars stormtrooper litigation upheld in the uk supreme courtthe firm was also involved in the masri litigation and a case against the nigerian state which resulted in a  billion arbitral award process and industrial developments vs nnpcthe original bitcoin was designed to work within the law and so that illegal activity could be reversed this functionality seems to have been corrupted in the version of btc in use todaythe miners and coin issuers are not at fault here and dr wright is not saying they are in any way to blame but they do have the ability to return the coins a new transaction can be created to amend any previous transactionit will certainly be interesting to see if they decide to agree with him or prevent the money from being returned to the trusts accountsa favorable ruling would mean that thousands of others who have either lost their coins or had them stolen can follow a similar path to recover their lost bitcoinwhether you support dr wright or not it will be interesting to see how the case develops there are huge amounts of money at stake here and having the ability to recover stolen coins could completely change the way that bitcoin is tradedexamining the nature and extent of legal duties conferred upon and owed by developers resulting from the control they exercise over their respective blockchains could have a knockon effect for a very long timedisclosure i have an account on blockchain social media platform twetch which has earned  from posts made on the platform since october  i use these funds to pay to post and like other posts on the posts on the platform i have never purchased sold or traded any type of bitcoin and do not have a trading account
