treasury department secretary janet yellen is not big on bitcoin a point she reiterated recently when she called the digital currency speculative and “inefficient”that doesn’t mean yellen and the department she leads — which includes the internal revenue service — don’t care about the cryptocurrencynow that it’s incometax filing season people holding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will see that the irs is actually very curious about a taxpayer’s cryptocurrency transactionsso much so that it has tweaked the first page of form  — the main piece of incometax paperwork taxpayers file yearly — to ask taxpayers if they’ve received sold sent exchanged “or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency”a “yes” could mean more taxes but not necessarily tax experts told marketwatchcryptocurrencies keep achieving a progressively higher profile last week bitcoin hit an aggregate value above  trillion as more people eye cryptocurrencies more people have to face up to the tax rules at play“it can be super super easy or it can be insanely complicated” said matt metras of mdm financial services in rochester ny some transactions can spur multiple tax events at once but tax professionals have scant irs guidance to work off he saidhere’s a primer on some taxtime issues when it comes to cryptocurrencythe basics on how the irs views cryptocurrenciesthe irs treats cryptocurrency as property it’s helpful to remember tax rules that also apply on stocks if value goes up and the owner sells at a profit they’ll likely pay capitalgains taxif a sale at a profit occurs within a year of purchase the proceeds count as a shortterm capital gain that is taxed as ordinary income which means it is lumped with other things like wages and taxed at a marginal rate corresponding to the bracket the taxpayer falls intoif the sale happens at least one year after the acquisition that’s a longterm capital gain a single filer making under  and a married couple making under  get a  rate pretty much everyone else gets a  rate with the rate applying to incomes up to  for individuals and  for married couples filing jointlythat’s still a lower rate than five of the seven incometax bracketsbut cryptocurrency is volatile stuff for example shortly after bitcoin’s market value hit the  trillion mark it was on the cusp of entering a bear marketso it’s important to remember the tax treatment for losses said ben weiss chief operating officer and cofounder of coinflip which has bitcoin atms in  locations allowing people to buy and sell cryptocurrencyif the value goes down and the investor sells at a loss they get a capitalloss deduction when yearly annual loses exceed yearly annual gains the taxpayer gets to also deduct up to  a year excess losses beyond that can be carried forward to future tax yearswhat if i get paid in cryptocurrencywhen you get paid for services via bitcoin btcusd   ether ethusd  or any other cryptocurrency that counts as ordinary income it doesn’t matter what the medium of payment is when it comes to the question of “whether the remuneration constitutes wages for employment tax purposes” the irs saidcryptocurrency that an independent contractor receives for work counts as selfemployment income the irs noted in both cases the value of the cryptocurrency is measured by its us dollar value on the date of receiptso how do i respond to this irs questionnear the top of the  the irs wants a yes or no answer to this question “at any time during  did you receive sell send exchange or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency”remember “yes” doesn’t necessarily mean more taxes experts said for example if someone just buys and holds crypto there’s no tax event because there’s no ensuing sale for a profit or loss metras said someone like that could check the “yes” to the answer and not have to report the purchase in their return he addedlaura walter owner of crypto tax girl near salt lake city utah says you need to say “yes” if for example you sold cryptocurrency traded it spent it on goods and services received it as compensation or received an airdrop or fork a hard fork can happen when a digital coin splits and an airdrop is a way for a company to hype a coin with a giveaway and airdrop it into ledger addresses parsing the language on the  instructions walter says you can check “no” if you merely held the crypto asset or transferred it among your own digital wallets and also if you only bought it but did nothing else “you don’t have to report anywhere how much you’re holding or where all you report is when you have a taxable event” she saidmetras however thinks a person should answer “yes” if they merely bought cryptocurrency“there’s mixed messages coming out of  on who should be checking the box” metras said “i think the irs and treasury aren’t sure what data they are trying to get out of the question … i think the potential repercussions of checking ‘yes’ unnecessarily are much lower than not checking ‘yes’ when the irs decided you should have”where do i get the necessary tax recordsbrokerage firms will automatically generate the necessary tax paperwork but that’s not necessarily the case in cryptocurrency exchangesthe task of tallying up gains and losses can fall on the cryptocurrency holder walter said “my biggest advice to taxpayers is keep track of your records” tax software can track transactions she said another way is a simple spreadsheet weiss saidpeople who have not been keeping close tabs through the year — “basically everyone i work with” walter said — can go back and gather up transaction information from their wallets and the exchanges they’ve used but that takes timefor the firsttimers who got into crypto in  and are sorting out their buys and sells walter has another bit of advice alongside an appointment with a tax preparer “just file  an extension you can’t just do this overnight”exchanges like gemini coinbase and kraken all have to maintain transaction records for five years weiss said don’t be afraid to contact them if there are questions he said “it’s better to talk to customer support and be embarrassed that you don’t know your password than to not have those records” he saidwhat are my audit risksthey could be getting more seriousirs officials could soon be “shifting from education to compliance and enforcement” according to metras still he added later “we don’t know exactly what the enforcement phase is going to look like”giving the virtualcurrency question such prominent play on the  is a good indicator irs officials “are keeping their eye on” crypto assets walter addedothers agree the irs is getting more serious “regulators are poised to commence a flurry of enforcement actions related to virtualcurrency tax fraud” attorneys at bakerhostetler a national law firm wrotein summer  the irs sent out more than  letters to virtualcurrency holders who may have failed to report all income and tax obligations the “educational letters” were part of the irs’s expanding focus on cryptocurrency irs commissioner charles rettig said at the timethe irs likely didn’t have its sights on taxpayers with smaller holdings marketwatch tax columnist bill bischoff said around that time “the agency is more interested in tracking down individuals and businesses that engage in significant virtualcurrency transactions while failing to comply with the tax rules” he saida little taxtime common sense can go a long way “if you sell  of bitcoin and a wire transfer shows for that amount they are going to see it” weiss said “you’re basically rolling the dice if you put  in the bank and are not reporting anything”
