recently bloomberg published a piece calling bitcoin an “incredibly dirty business” it’s undeniable that the bitcoin blockchain has a carbon footprint some bitcoins are mined with nonrenewable energy although plenty is mined with hydro nuclear or otherwisevented natural gas too no one contests the externality of bitcoin although the precise carbon footprint is debated however the article by opinion columnist lionel laurent unfortunately relies on the flawed assumption that individual bitcoin transactions carry an energy overheadthe question of bitcoin’s energy footprint is riven with misconceptions firstly it’s a mistake to compare bitcoin to payment networks and comparisons relying on relative energy use are spuriouscoindesk columnist nic carter is partner at castle island ventures a public blockchainfocused venture fund based in cambridge mass he is also the cofounder of coin metrics a blockchain analytics startupsecond metrics like the “pertransaction energy cost” are misleading because transactions themselves do not cost energy nor does bitcoin’s  footprint scale with transactional countbitcoin supporters and critics alike should understand how the protocol works so the energy costs and externalities of the system can be honestly appraisedbitcoin and visa an applestokoalas comparisonin the bloomberg piece the author statesone bitcoin transaction would generate the  equivalent to  swipes of a visa credit card according to digiconomist’s closelyfollowed index albeit with none of the convenience of plasticbut the “energy exchange rate” methodology the author relies on is completely mistaken bitcoin transactions are not equivalent to visa transactions they are different in both form and substancefirst of all bitcoin and visa are fundamentally different systems bitcoin is a complete selfcontained monetary settlement system visa transactions are nonfinal credit transactions that rely on external underlying settlement rails visa relies on ach fedwire swift the global correspondent banking system the federal reserve and of course the military and diplomatic strength of the us government to ensure all of the above are working smoothlyany energy comparison must take the above into account – including the externalities from the extraction of oil which implicitly backs the dollar as those who make this comparison inevitably fail to mention the dollar’s ubiquity is partly due to a covert arrangement whereby the us provides military support to countries like saudi arabia that agree to sell oil exclusively for dollars it’s worth noting that the grossly oversized us military whose presence worldwide is necessary to backstop the international dollar system is the largest single consumer of oil worldwidebitcoin transactions by contrast rely just on bitcoin bitcoin proposes a new monetary unit also named bitcoin and mediates its circulation through the bitcoin protocol which is administered by nodes and miners bitcoin’s energy footprint is highly transparent due to the accessible and highly integrated nature of the system this provides fertile ammunition for critics who can easily estimate the externalities of bitcoin while insisting no equivalent ones exist for the dollar system but the two systems are differentuntil visa marshals its own private armies to keep the integrity of the dollar intact the comparison will be a specious onebitcoin is a fullstack monetary and payments system visa is a thin layer within the international dollar system wholly reliant on seamless interoperability of the rest of the payments and settlement pyramid until visa marshals its own private armies to keep the integrity of the dollar intact the comparison will be a specious onesubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policyif you look at the actual characteristics of bitcoin transactions as compared with visa their differences are clear while both systems transmit trillions of dollars of value per year they do so in radically different waysin   visa processed  trillion in payments volume via  billion transactions that gives us an average transaction size of  bitcoin by contrast settled  billion using coin metrics’ adjusted volume estimates over the period and handled  million transactions the average transaction size for bitcoin over the period  during that time there were eight distinct transactions worth over  billion the largest among these settled a mammoth  billion given bitcoin’s price at the timeand not only can transactions be very large but they can direct value to a number of recipients all at once the largestever transaction in terms of payments contained  outputs under current constraints a bitcoin transaction could theoretically contain up to  outputs and of course layered or sidechain approaches which propose new trust models like lightning liquid rsk and stacks introduce the potential to batch thousands of transactions and settle them on the base layer a single bitcoin transaction can settle millions of lightning paymentssee also nic carter – the last word on bitcoin’s energy consumptionso not only are visa transactions generally much smaller than bitcoin transfers but they are different from an assurance perspective bitcoin provides final settlement within a few blocks this means there is no risk of transaction reversal the payment itself is integrated with the settlement – there is no distinction visa credit payments by contrast are designed to be reversible if need be this is why cardholders generally have the option of making chargebacks within  days of their paymentmuch to the chagrin of some merchants payments are not bundled with settlement instead the visa payment process is a tangle of distinct authorization clearing and settlement steps actual final settlement happens on an aggregate net basis between merchants banks who manage the accounts for cardaccepting merchants and issuing banks who manage the cardholder accounts via ach or wire transfer this means that payments are bundled up and settled on an endofday basis through utilitygrade settlement channels the individual payments made when you swipe your card are several layers removed from the final flows of funds between banksthese gigantic wire transfers that power settlement between cardholder banks and merchant banks for visa are the transactions most comparable to those of bitcoin the individual payments happening between visa users and visa merchants are unsettled ious if you consider ach and especially fedwire transfers their characteristics are much more akin to bitcoin typical ach transfers clear thousands of dollars while your average fedwire transfer settles millionsfedwire transfers are “push” rather than “pull” – bank accounts have to be fully funded on the originating side for the transfer to process no netting occurs in fedwire it is what’s called a “realtime gross settlement system” fedwire’s counterpart chips which is used for international dollar settlements does include significant netting checking if banks are paying each other and only sending the difference unlike a check or a visa payment you cannot reverse a wire transfer this gives wires strong finality and good settlement assurances sound familiar and like bitcoin fedwire processes a few hundred million transactions a year in  it averaged  txns per day in that period bitcoin averaged  daily payments in  daily txnsthese systems scale with transactional size not frequency so if you’re going to compare bitcoin to established transaction systems compare like with like note that swift is not an apt comparison to bitcoin it is a messaging rather than a settlement system and generally relies on thirdparty settlement through fedwire or chipsbitcoin’s energy cost of transactions explainednow we’ve established that bitcoin transfers are much more akin to wire transfers let’s consider the actual “cost” of bitcoin transactions the quantitative assumptions made by bitcoin critics – that transactions have a certain energy overhead – need to be contextualizedconstructing a bitcoin transaction and getting the network to accept it costs virtually no energy whatsoever what costs energy is grinding through the nonce space to find valid blocks miners do this because they are compensated primarily with the coinbase reward of  btc per block which is defined in the protocol currently miners collect about  percent of their total revenue of  per day in fees but it’s important to decompose transaction fees and general revenue from creating blocks miners collect that coinbase reward regardless of whether they include transactions in blocks on occasion they mine empty blocks and collect that  perblock reward regardlessthe individual payments made when you swipe your card are several layers removed from the final flows of funds between banksthe quantity of resources that miners are willing to spend on mining is purely a function of three variables the price of bitcoin the issuance rate and the fees transactors are paying to use the chain of those three the first two matter most as mentioned fees are not a major source of revenue today the system is naturally equilibrating if the price of bitcoin goes up or fees dramatically rise miner margins expand inducing existing miners to increase their expenditure or new miners to enter the market thus margins contract to a level where mining is just barely profitableas defined in the protocol the perblock reward is cut in half every four years this reduces bitcoin’s issuance rate and thus the miner revenue so in the long term miner revenue from issuance will dramatically contract as  of all coins have been mined already mining is structurally shrinking not a growing industry academic prognostications of a climatedestroying feedback loop are therefore wildly offbase while fees are expected to compensate miners in the long term it’s unlikely that users would stomach  fees in a purely feebased system with  fees and optimistically  transactions per day miner revenue would total  billion per year – far less than the current  billion in annualized miner revenuethus most of the miner expenditure – and hence carbon outlay – from bitcoin is due to largely invariant coin issuance rather than any variable that’s correlated to transactional intensity this fact invalidates the “energy cost of transactions” metric that critics like to promote it is issuance that largely finances miners not transactions and because most coins have been issued already bitcoin’s future carbon outlay is likely to shrink this is to say nothing of the energy mix that miners employ – and as we know renewables and otherwisevented natural gas make up a meaningful component of the industry according to the cambridge center for alternative finance  of bitcoin’s energy outlay derives from renewables with  of miners using renewables in some capacity
