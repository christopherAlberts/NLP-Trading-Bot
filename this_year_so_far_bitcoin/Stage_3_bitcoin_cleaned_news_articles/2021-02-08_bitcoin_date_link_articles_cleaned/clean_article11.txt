if you want a bitcoin you have three ways to acquire it you can buy it you can receive it as payment or you can  well just go get itthe first two methods are selfexplanatory and theyre the usual subjects of the debate around bitcoin its value as an investment and as a currency as for the third method bitcoins are created through a process called mining in which computer power hashing power is used to solve a puzzle in pursuit of a number called a nonce in theory these puzzles could be done with a pen and paper they arent mathematically challenging they just require a lot of numbercrunching and guessworkso why buy a bitcoin for monday mornings price of roughly  when you can just solve one of these puzzles and get one on your own to answer that question it helps to think of the traits bitcoin shares not with other currencies or investments but with something else  commoditiesnot your typical commoditythe us commodity futures trading commission characterizes bitcoin as a commodity so that derivative contracts like futures and options can be traded based on its underlying value this makes a certain amount of sense whats considered a commodity has changed over time but from goats to gold commodities all have something in common theyre fungible meaning interchangeable there may be different types of tea and grades of motor oil but a gallon of unleaded gasoline is more or less the same no matter where you get itin most commoditydependent industries when the price of the underlying commodity goes up supply starts to increase as well when prices of gold or copper go up miners respond by ramping up production its the same with oil higher supply eventually causes prices to go down and the cycle repeats but something strange is happening with bitcoin its price is near its alltime high but supply is increasing at its slowest pace ever there are several reasons for thisin the early days the puzzles that bitcoin miners had to solve were relatively easy and didnt require a lot of hashing power a dusty old central processing unit cpu would do the trick but the puzzles have gotten exponentially harder over time this is because bitcoins founders decided each block of bitcoin should take about  minutes to mine in an effort to keep a lid on supply as computing power surged so did the difficulty the difficulty is adjusted every  blocks  which is roughly every two weeks if it takes  minutes to mine a block in theory you could take the average hash rate and the time per block of the prior  blocks to estimate what the next difficulty number will be but its not a perfect science since sometimes a block is mined in far less than  minutes by pure luckin january of  the difficultly was  and the networks hash rate was  million hashes per second today the networks difficulty is closing in on  trillion and the hash rate is around  million terra hashes per second ths with a terra hash equalling  trillion hashes this is one reason behind the surging demand for nvidias nasdaqnvda topoftheline graphics processing units gpusso theres one part of our answer the computing power required to mine one block of bitcoin is exponentially higher now than it was  years ago even if the time it takes to mine one block is still around  minutessupply limitsif the time to mine a block is relatively constant over time why is bitcoin supply increasing at a slowing rate the answer is due to bitcoin halvingsthe first bitcoin block known as the genesis block yielded  bitcoin but after every  blocks are mined about every four years the reward is cut in half the first halving occurred on nov   the second was on july   and the third was on may   today each block yields just  bitcointhe maximum bitcoin supply that can ever be mined is  million this means that half of the total potential supply was generated within the first four years after bitcoins launch and  of the total supply will be mined before the next halving in  this table shows the pattern wellhalving bitcoin per block mined in period cumulative  of total supply mined launch               the effect of these halvings on supply may surprise you by   of all bitcoin will be in circulation leaving just  left to be mined just  bitcoin will be mined in the four years starting in  and before the century ends less than one bitcoin will be mined per year eventually the last bitcoin will be mined in so although bitcoin is near a record high price and the computing power being used to mine bitcoin is also at a record high bitcoin supply is increasing at its slowest rate in history for two reasonsthe bitcoin protocol has successfully adjusted the difficulty to mine a block of bitcoin which has kept an average pace of one block mined per  minutes despite exponentially higher computing power the bitcoin reward per block is halved every  blocksand now is really when we see commodity dynamics at workprofitabilityto be more successful miners join what are called pools where they combine their computing power and then split the prize from successfully mined blocks the best bitcoin mining rigs can cost upwards of  while the older models can be purchased for a few hundred dollars the whatsminer  has a hash rate of  trillion per second assuming a conservative electricity cost of  per kwh it can break even at a bitcoin price of  this looks like a sweet deal now but keep in mind that bitcoin was less than  just last aprilolder models like the antminer  which has a hash rate of just  trillion per second can break even at  bitcoin this hash rate was more than acceptable when bitcoin mining took less computing power and each block yielded  bitcoin and its been profitable recently but it could be a moneylosing endeavor if computing power floods the market and the difficulty increases at a faster pace than bitcoins price this has happened several times before when bitcoins price crashes or the difficulty level rises to the point where once profitable rigs become unprofitablein the oil industry new wells wont be drilled if the breakeven price per well is too close to the current price of oil this is why many oil majors have divested away from plays that were profitable at  oil or higher and its also why drilling ground to a halt when oil crashed and stayed below  from march through november of last yearbitcoin is similar new rigs wont be bought and miners wont mine if the breakeven is too close to the current price even the best rigs out there earn just  or so per day at  bitcoin assuming  electricity costs at a sticker price of  per rig it would take  days to break even if bitcoin crashes to  it would take a year and if the network is flooded with computing power and the difficulty goes up you could be out of luck entirelywhen the party endsthe common theme behind all commodities is that they have tangible use in everyday life therefore prices spike if production goes down electricity prices go up during a power outage water prices go up if a water main burststhese tangible effects can also offer opportunity when oil topped  per barrel in  it was because the world was consuming more oil and thought it would run out but new technologies like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing unlocked previously unprofitable reserves and today many companies can turn a profit at  oilunlike oil bitcoin isnt tangible and doesnt have practical use in the physical world it has a limited supply and the bitcoin protocol ensures that new bitcoins are produced at a consistent though dwindling rate independent of computing power in this way bitcoins relationship with supply production and price is completely different from traditional commodities that makes sense because it was after all originally intended to be something else  currencythe power of halving is truly incredible considering that by  the annual bitcoin supply will be increasing by hundreds not millions per year once that additional supply becomes negligible we could see bitcoins price volatility go way down and only then perhaps will bitcoin stop reminding us of commodities and investments and truly become what it was intended to be
