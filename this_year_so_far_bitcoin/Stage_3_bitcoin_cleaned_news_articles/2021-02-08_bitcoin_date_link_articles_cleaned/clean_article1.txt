germany etc have taken a positive stance towards cryptocurrenciesit is not news that most cryptocurrencies in the market have a limited supply bitcoin is also one of them this year the third bitcoin halving took placebitcoin halving is an important event in the bitcoin network that happens every four yearsthe bitcoin network works because it introduces new bitcoins in the market by a process called bitcoin mining bitcoin miners do this mining by verifying bitcoin blocks which are simply groups of bitcoin transactionsevery  minutes a miner who can verify one block of transactions and add it to the bitcoin network gets awarded a certain amount of bitcoins as a rewardcurrently this reward stands at  btc per valid block mined but this reward per block reduces by half roughly every four years or after every  blocks are mined this phenomenon of bitcoin block reward getting reduced by  every four years is termed as bitcoin halvingit also doubles the stock to flow ratio total currency available total currency in circulation making is highly scarcehalving is one of the most critical factors that contribute to the price of bitcoinsince there are only  million bitcoins in total there is less circulation of the market currency as the reward decreases and as more people become aware of the assets scarcity more demand rises resulting in a higher pricesince bitcoin holds more than half of the market capitalisation the bitcoin price variation may affect other currenciescryptocurrency is a digital currency that can be used as both  a store of value and a mode of exchange while it has just started to gain attention as a legit payment method it has established itself as a new asset class over the past decadeeven if the public is unwilling to use it for transactions many want to convert their cash into crypto because they believe that its deflationary nature makes it a better store of value and a hedge against inflationespecially in india after the rbi ban against cryptocurrency was lifted its investors had a significant surgemany platforms have launched and received funding in this space to make crypto investing accessible one such platform is coinswitch kuber  acquiring over two million users in just six months after it launchedas cryptocurrency is becoming more accessible to the public more retail investors want a share of the asset class and are willing
