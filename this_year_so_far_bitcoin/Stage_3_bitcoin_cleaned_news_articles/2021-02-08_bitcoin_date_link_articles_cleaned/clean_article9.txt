btcusd   already on a stratospheric rise garnered an additional fillip from the announcement with a single bitcoin changing hands on monday at  up over  prices touched a record peak near but one of the key questions swirling around the decision by the manufacturer of electric vehicles is whether the move including the decision to eventually allow for the sale of its products to take place in bitcoins is a prudent use of capital it’s a question that’s particularly important given the wild swings that both shares of tesla tsla  and bitcoin are prone to even if those assets have both been on a nearly uninterrupted ride higher“i think this is awful strategy on many many levels” christopher schwarz associate professor of finance and faculty director of the center for investment and wealth management at the university of california at irvine in emailed comments“in essence this is like creating  risk since none of tesla’s suppliers are paid in bitcoin” schwarz told marketwatchan email to

holdings to around  billion at the end of last year up from around  billion at the end of that means that its current bitcoin allocation represents about  of its cash holdings“tesla’s purchase of bitcoin is an unusual use of corporate cash which is typically held in safer and less volatile assets such as shortterm fixed income securities to ensure liquidity and limit volatility” jerry klein managing director and partner at treasury partners based in new york told marketwatch via email“while tesla shareholders are reacting positively to the news it remains to be seen how shareholders would react if a decline in bitcoin’s price negatively affects tesla’s future earnings” klein said “cfos are willing to accept risk in their overall business but not with the cash on their balance sheet while bitcoin has been surging in recent months it’s been very volatile over the past few years” he saidto be sure tesla isn’t the first company and isn’t likely to be the last to apportion some

monday afternoon phone interview that the electricvehicle maker is often framed as having cash management troubles but believes that that is a bogus assesment“i think that there’s this very stale narrative around tesla’s liquidity that is no longer consistent around its balance sheet or its cash flow generation” osha saidhe makes the case that the companies investment in bitcoin is trivial against the scale of its ability to generate cash and aligns with the company’s strategy of being a disrupter“i see it as another step in tesla’s effort to reinvent how cars are sold and delivered to people” said osha who is referring to tesla’s directtocustomer sales model osha estimates that tesla generated about  billion in free cash flow in the december quarterchester spatt professor at

cash management option partial btc allocation” trenchev told marketwatch“sitting on piles of cash offers little to no return and gets constantly devalued by central banks’ excessive qe measures having a treasury policy that diversifies risk and return as well as looking into ‘the fastest horse’ is not only a sound policy but is also the one that most adheres to the key principle of maximizing shareholder value” he said
