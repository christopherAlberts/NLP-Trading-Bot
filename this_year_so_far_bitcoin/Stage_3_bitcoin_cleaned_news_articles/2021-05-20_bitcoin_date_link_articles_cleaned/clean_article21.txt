leading cryptocurrency bitcoin cryptobtc is finally hitting a rough patch tesla nasdaqtsla ceo elon musk backtracked on allowing customers to use the digital currency to purchase vehicles and regulators in china have reeled in crypto trading and restricted its use as a form of payment as of this writing bitcoin is down nearly  from its alltime high of nearly  per coin as a resultmeanwhile square nysesq which owns popular peertopeer payments and bitcoin trading platform cash app is down about  from its peak square revealed it owned just over  bitcoin tokens on march  at that time valued at  million so the steep drop in bitcoin price as of late puts a serious dent in squares balance sheet  and its the likely reason for the stocks dipin spite of the negative trend as of late bitcoin and square still have promising futures which is the better buy the answer depends on the type of investor you arereasons to buy bitcoinbitcoin is considered to be the first cryptocurrency it utilizes a decentralized digital ledger system known as a blockchain meaning no central bank or government issues it or controls it its a highly liquid asset bitcoin can be traded  hours a day on a crypto trading platform or app and though one coin is worth tens of thousands of dollars one bitcoin is divisible into smaller parts known as satoshis like how a dollar can be broken down in cents one bitcoin equals  million satoshisas bitcoin has gained momentum among investors and businesses it has skyrocketed in value in the last decade it was designed to be a digital payments system that facilitates exchange of goods and services online but because it has a limited supply the maximum total number of bitcoins is pegged at  million and over  million of them have already been mined so far bitcoins price is highly contingent on demand among investors and tradersin fact this limited supply and surging demand is the main reason for the cryptocurrencys big increase in value amidst rising government spending around the world which necessitates minting of new money by central banks some investors view bitcoin as a better store of value than governmentissued fiat currency and as protection against inflation because the number of bitcoins is fixed a steady increase in demand over time will mean a rising price and if bitcoin ever becomes a widely accepted form of digital payment the increase in circulation could help stabilize the wild ups and downs in price that are inherent in the digital coin at the momentreasons to buy squaresquare and its subsidiary cash app had  billion in cash and shortterm investments on its balance sheet as of the end of march  making bitcoin worth over  of its liquid assets square is thus an indirect bet on the price of bitcoin however square is more than a passive investor in the leading cryptocurrencycash app allows users to buy sell and hold bitcoin in their digital wallet as well as send and receive bitcoin to other users including merchants that accept it as payment a minimal fee disclosed at the time of trade and variable depending on current bitcoin market volatility is charged however cash app currently generates little value from bitcoin square revealed in its firstquarter  earnings update that it generated  billion in bitcoin revenue but gross profit revenue minus cost of revenue was only  millionthat doesnt mean bitcoin is a worthless endeavor for square though it has picked up millions of new cash app users in the last year by touting the ability to trade bitcoin and once onboarded square can promote cash apps digital payments and basic banking capabilities to these new users besides a big line item on squares balance sheet bitcoin can be thought of as a marketing campaign to acquire more consumers and businesses on its platformlonger term if bitcoin does pick up steam as a form of digital payment squares transactional business it earns a fee every time a payment is processed on its network could be a top crypto beneficiarywhich is the better buythe supplydemand argument for bitcoins continual rise over time is legit but bitcoin is a type of fixed asset as the recent price action demonstrates owning cryptocurrency can be an incredibly volatile endeavor that may not sit well with all investors if you dont like extreme swings in your portfolios value keep bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in general only as a small position think singledigit percentages or less of your portfolio overallby contrast square is a dynamic business that uses fixed assets to grow and generate profit it owns a sizable chunk of bitcoin so shareholders will benefit if bitcoin rises in price but square is also using its crypto holdings to build its user base and promote activity on its platform and because its a business that generates revenue and profit a tangible valuation can be placed on square stockexcluding bitcoin revenue square stock trades for about  times  revenue free cash flow has recently dipped back into the red as the company spends to promote growth but it demonstrated in  and  that it will eventually be a highly profitable company it generated several hundred million in free cash flow in both those yearsbitcoin may have a place in your portfolio but i personally have a bias toward businesses that utilize assets like bitcoin as part of their operations square stock gets my nod as a better buy right now
