goes a bit crazyfiat currencies are never this exciting set its most recent high of just under  on april  after that it had steadily given ground and that became a headlong crash in the early hours of wednesday morning by  am new york time hit  — a fall of almost  per cent in five weeks over the next four hours it rallied almost  per cent at the time of writing the price is  it was quite a ridebitcoin is still blessed or plagued with believers rather than investors there are lots of great arguments for bitcoin and even more for the block­chain technology on which it is based while it inspires cultish devotion it is difficult to analyse as an investable assetthat’s a shame because this was one day when the crypto world appeared to be the tail that wagged the stock market dog the sp  sold off sharply at the open as traders looked at the bloodbath in cryp­t­o­currencies overnight and then spent most of the day re­g­aining ground as bitcoin staged its own spectacular rebound it did this even after the somewhat hawkish minutes from the last federal open market com­m­ittee meeting gave another reason to sell stocksnaturally this has lots to do with emotion and in particular with but even if we take musk’s hype and the exci­t­e­ment he generated into acco­unt nothing happened in the early hours of wednesday to justify such a huge selloff and rally and while waves of emot­ion happen in markets all the time they are seldom this pow­e­rful or as swift so how to exp­lain what has happened could it have been predicted and can we predict anything for the futurecurse of the ipothere was one surefire clue that something like this was going to happen throughout history initial public offerings have taken place at peaks of confidence when the owners of a big private company think market conditions are as good as they are going to get they will go public and as they know what they are doing the rest of us should take the hintcoinbase global the biggest intermediary in the space listed last month at almost the exact top for bitcoin i’m not saying that backers of coinbase had any inside information just that they understood conditions were as good as they were going to getthe show was more entertaining and his arg­u­ments against bitcoin on environmental grounds are valid — although he should have been perfectly aware of these problems before he started plugging cryptocurrencies but we shou­ld­n’t have taken our eyes off the coinbase show the curse of the ipo will not be deniedbracing for regulationif the coinbase ipo was a good “tell” that bitcoin was ready for one of its periodic steep falls it didn’t give a good cue for wed­nesday’s flash crash regulators did bitcoin generates much of its excitement precisely be­cau­se it is an alternative to fiat curr­e­ncies like gold it might be able to hold its value impervious to the actions of governmentsthe problem is that governmental fiat can destroy currencies as well as create them governments hold a monopoly on issuing currency and would understandably be loath to lose it this is one of the most serious “bear” points against bitc­oin and it got a lot of new supp­­ort in the hours before the flash crash from china came the news that payment and credit organisations were to be block­ed from accepting bitcoin in the us the new comptroller of the currency at the treasury de­p­­artment — succeeding a man recruited by the trump ad­min­istration from coinbase of all places — announced a review of crypto regulation policymichael hsu the acting comptroller said “at the occ the focus has been on encouraging responsible innovation for instance we created an office of innovation updated the framework for chartering national banks and trust companies and interpreted crypto custody services as part of the business of banking i have ask­ed staff to review these actions”this is far from a declaration of war and he made clear his belief that financial technology companies had a future but any sign that the lenient regime currently in place might be changed was unwelcome for bitcoin investorsit isn’t a coincidence that the extreme selling started after the chinese news however it shouldn’t be surprising that a bad news item in asian hours prompted a flash crashbitcoin has formed at least three classic bubbles already in its brief history each time it has crashed by  per cent or more and then revived after a few yearswhere does this leave us my best guess is that another surge in assets has peaked and that it will probably be a while before the high from last month is revisited given bitcoin’s ability to pick itself up and start again dem­onstrated several times now it is way too soon to say that this is a burst bubble whether it really establishes itself as a part or even an essential part of the global financial system will depend on how many people use it and how tolerant central bankers are of that while bitcoin continues to develop it will be worth as much as someone is prepared to pay for it the digital currency’s fortunes are likely to remain tied to risk appetite in society at large whatever direction bitcoin goes in we can expect other risk assets to go the same way
