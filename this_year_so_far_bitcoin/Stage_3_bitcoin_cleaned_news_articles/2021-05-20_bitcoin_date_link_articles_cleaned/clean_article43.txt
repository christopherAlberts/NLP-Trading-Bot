if youre a bitcoin fan its been a rough week theres more than one reason thats the case but the most obvious is that the cryptocurrencys biggest evangelist elon musk has apparently abandoned the faithor has he its not entirely clear tesla revealed earlier this year that it had bought bitcoin valued at  billion that caused the currency to jump to what was a record at the time just a few weeks earlier bitcoin had jumped as much as  percent because musk added bitcoin to his twitter profilenow however confusion around musk and bitcoin has caused its value to fall almost  percent in the past two weeksfirst musk tweeted last week that tesla would no longer accept bitcoin as payment for new cars because of the massive energy consumption involved with mining the cryptocurrency that caused the price of bitcoin to drop  percent even though musks tweet said that tesla wont be selling its current bitcointhen over the weekend musk sparked uncertainty when he tweeted in response to a suggestion that tesla may have in fact sold off its stake and that no one could blame musk after the criticism he had faced musks response was one word indeedare you confused yetwhatever you think of tesla or musk or bitcoin i think we can all agree theres a very real problem when the value of a currency can fluctuate so dramatically just because of one persons tweets in this case the tweet wasnt even clear had tesla already sold its position was musk agreeing that he would be justified in having tesla do thattesla later clarified that it had not sold its stake but it hasnt seemed to help stop bitcoins free fall a single bitcoin is currently valued at just under  after being as high as  earlier this monthlook musk is one of the wealthiest men on the planet the value of bitcoin is virtually meaningless to a person worth roughly  billion it almost seems like its a game for himexcept right now the price of bitcoin isnt rational and it isnt based on any sort of intrinsic value its not even functioning as a currency for a currency to be useful it has to be relatively stable and reliable the value of bitcoin is so volatile that it isnt useful at all of transactionsno one in their right mind would use bitcoin to pay for anything unless you think the value is going to continue to plummet but if thats the case no one is going to accept it for bitcoin to function as a currency both parties have to think it will remain stable and reliableright now bitcoin is neither of those things and thats in large part because of musks tweetsthats a problem for the millions of people who follow him on twitter almost none of whom are billionaires or even millionaires and for those who have invested in bitcoin musks tweets have no doubt caused more than a few headachesessentially people who are buying bitcoin arent buying a currencytheyre buying the hype the problem is when the hype is based on one personeven if you think hes the smartest person on earthits a really bad idea
