i asked my seventh grader luke to help me with an atypical chore competitive pricing benchmarking for a rental property this task was in addition to his normal chores and he looked dubious so i sweetened the offer by offering to pay him in cash candy or bitcoinafter a few questions about cryptocurrency we shook hands and had a deal soon he was the proud owner of  bitcoinstechnically i still owe him  bitcoins as i have yet to figure out which cryptocurrency platform allows minors to open accounts but luke knows i’m good for it because this is not his first time investingwe started investing when he was a second grader same as his older sisters we’ve told our kids that we will fund any investment that we collectively agree on between now and the age of  we don’t plan to leave them an inheritance so we want them to be equipped for a future in which their own investments give them financial securitywe are intentional about teaching our kids about money because collectively as americans we focus a lot on earning money but collectively we stink at managing moneysome  of americans make a major financial mistake before the age of  seventy percent of wealthy families lose their wealth by the next generation professionals are not any better nearly  of actively managed funds fail to beat the sp we don’t want our kids to necessarily beat the market we want our kids to be able to think independently about money we want them to manage their money not let it manage them we want them to find the right balance between ignorance and obsession with moneyin early elementary school my kids were too young to be interested in financial statements strategy or valuation that forced me to keep things simple and engaging i started with peter lynch’s principle of “invest in what you know” or at least in what you’re interested inluke was interested in mars and space travel after seeing a rocket launch at cape canaveral that his uncle had worked on i didn’t have access to spacex shares so i offered him a few choices to pick from including a few aerospace companies including tesla as a proxy for spacex our financial advisor did warn him that their own research said tesla was rated a sell luke was undeterred and confirmed he wanted tesla which he bought at  per share in  in his utma accounti didn’t ask my kids if they wanted to invest rather i gave them a set of choices to pick from that mirrored the kinds of choices they were accustomed to we didn’t ask the kids if they wanted to eat vegetables we asked them if they wanted broccoli or spinachbut i did ask them to do some critical thinking about the future demand for their investments my eldest miya invested in apple in  when she was we would go to the apple store to look at their latest products and i would ask her if she thought the new products were much more exciting than the prior ones i would ask her what kinds of phones her friends wanted my middle child audrey owns alphabet i ask her if she watches more youtube than a year ago and which search engine she likes best we use the rule of  to ask them to figure out how many years until the category — not the company — doubles and use that as a basis for investingevery year i also ask if the kids want to sell their investments i learned with my older nieces to not make this a binary choice of hold the stock or cash out instead i ask my kids “if you sold what would you invest in instead” this reinforces the idea that time in the market matters more than timing the market i want them to know that young people with long horizons should take much more risk not lesswe want our children to be selfaware of feel the full spectrum of feelings that money induces i share stories of when others took a risk to express a different point of view and were mocked publicly but proven right in the long run stories stick much more than strategies we also make our kids pay for their own cell phones and data plans just so they could feel the pain of tradeoffsonce when miya felt the embarrassment of insufficient funds in her bank account while trying to buy a frappucino at starbucks i was secretly delighted feelings linger much longer than facts and we want our kids to taste the agency that comes from growing something of their ownour kids know investing matters whether they turn out to be good investors well only time will tell but least for now tesla and bitcoin ensure we always have something interesting to talk about we will all collectively benefit if we can raise a new generation of savvier investors at a much earlier ageeddie yoon is the cofounder of the substack newsletter category pirates and the author of “superconsumers”photo gallery click to enlarge
