nobel prizewinning economist paul krugman who has been a strong critic of cryptocurrencies in the past said in a series of tweets on wednesday that he has given up on predicting the demise of bitcoin calling it a “cult that can survive indefinitely”the economist who is also a columnist at the new york times has criticised the use of bitcoin several times in the past even calling it “evil” in the pastin his recent tweets he said while bitcoin has been around since  “nobody seems to have found any good legal use for it” but accepted that the cryptocurrency has a cultlike following that may keep it afloat“it’s not a convenient medium of exchange it’s not a stable store of value it’s definitely not a unit of account” krugman said of bitcoin“but i’ve given up predicting imminent demise there always seem to be a new crop of believers maybe just think of it as a cult that can survive indefinitely” the economist saidkrugman who won the nobel prize in economic sciences in  for his work on international trade theory says he is a sceptic mainly because of two things about cryptocurrencies – “transaction costs and the absence of tethering”in a  column entitled “transaction costs and tethers why i’m a crypto skeptic” he says compared to fiat currency crypto tokens cost more to transact in and have no value “backstop” or reinforcement like traditional governmentbacked currencies“instead of nearfrictionless transactions we have high costs of doing business because transferring a bitcoin or other cryptocurrency unit requires providing a complete history of past transactions instead of money created by the click of a mouse we have money that must be mined — created through resourceintensive computations” he wrote in the columnback in  he was also of the view that a total collapse of cryptocurrencies was a possibility due to the absence of a backstop“their value depends entirely on selffulfilling expectations — which means that total collapse is a real possibility if speculators were to have a collective moment of doubt suddenly fearing that bitcoins were worthless well bitcoins would become worthless” krugman wroteon this point at least his opinions on bitcoin seem to have since changed – though he is no less dismissive of its other qualities
