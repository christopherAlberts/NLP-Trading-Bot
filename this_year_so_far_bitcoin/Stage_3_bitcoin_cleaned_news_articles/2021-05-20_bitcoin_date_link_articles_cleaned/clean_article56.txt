a rapper takes the stage he raps about crypto i’m blowing up like bitcoin i got it going to the max i ain’t no stcoin the crowd cheers and dances a giant screen displays a mix of nonfungible tokens it’s loud it’s weird it’s fun and this is when it fully hits you that the miami crypto expo is an actual expo filled with people actual people people who drink and laugh and hug and flirt this is not zoom this is not a “virtual conference” this is not an “online meetup” this is the real dealand the nftthemed expo held april  to  seems to have a deeper purpose to announce that miami is the real deal crypto is everywhere mayor francis suarez wants to make the city a crypto hub the miami heat basketball team will soon play in the ftx arena – astonishing mainstream publicity for samuel bankmanfried’s cryptocurrency exchange – and miami will soon play host to the upcoming bitcoin  conference now billed as “the largest bitcoin event in history”but is the hype real in my first bit of traveling since being fully vaccinated i wanted to visit miami in person – not via zoom – to see if there’s actual flesh and blood realworld evidence of miami’s crypto boom after all it’s easy to pump out press releases it’s easy for a mayor to tweet and it’s easy to claim you’re a crypto city back in  i visited “bitcoin city” in ljubljana slovenia i’ve been to the crypto city of zug switzerland akon is building a crypto city in uganda wyoming is the crypto state puerto rico is crypto utopia and so on it now seems like a proven playbook if your city needs a rebranding why not choose cryptoso it’s time finally to get back on the roadbooths and porschesmy guide for the event is tatiana moroz a folk singersongwriter who mainlines crypto she once funded an album in cryptocurrency she launched a “tatiana coin” and her podcast called “proof of love” explores the place “where sex love and life meet crypto” her libertarian and cryptoinspired songs such as “bitcoin jingle” include lyrics

whenever you payuse bitcoin whenever you paymoroz spent most of her life in new jersey and new york city but in the depths of the coronavirus pandemic like so many she needed a change she had friends in miami she visited she loved it she moved easy choice “miami is all the fire and then some” says moroz “i don’t think there’s any marketing ploy” she was drawn to the art deco architecture the strong latin influence the art scene the libertarian vibe the nightlife even during  and the procrypto mayor it doesn’t hurt that “everybody’s super hot” she’s not wrongon the first day of the expo i soak in the familiar beats and rhythms of a crypto conference which i haven’t felt in years it’s almost nostalgic booths hawking crypto swag the fuk the banks tshirts panels and workshops with titles like “bitcoin mining for noobs” and “how to run a crypto business without going to jail” masks are worn dutifully by some drooped around the neck by others and not at all by most full disclosure i would not have felt comfortable covering the event if not fully vaccinatedtatiana moroz tatiana moroz“me and my team we’ve been saying ‘miami is the bitcoin capital of america’ for two years” says the sunny and alwayssmiling eryka gemma the expo’s mc “we just saw it coming” gemma started hosting miami crypto meetups back in  she points to miami’s underrated international banking presence its longtime crypto roots and its latin american influence “you see a lot of latin americans who saw what hyperinflation did to their home nations” she says “so they understand bitcoin”then there’s the nft scene at night the posh lobby of the intercontinental hotel is transformed into a crypto art gallery or “nft gala” courtesy of a miamibased group called bit basel the bitcoin logo is everywhere – in the nft paintings on tshirts even on some of the masks it feels like a proper art gala spiked with a shot of crypto hope many of the artists are present such as ali spagnola who livepaints the image of a rocket going “to the moon”miami is all the fire and then somelambos maybe not but you can’t miss the crypto porsche earlier in the week at a party that featured a rick ross performance held on april  and called “the  party” the artist rich b caliente unveiled a porsche he had painted a striking mix of teal and pink emblazoned with streaks of yellows and reds and purples it’s not subtle the trickedout ride was signed by ross and auctioned off as an nft for over  perhaps the perfect symbol of newfound nft wealthsome of the artwork incorporates augmented reality like a series from lucho poletti called “novus moneta seclorum” which is latin for “new currency for the ages” i was mesmerized by the art decoinspired piece “citadel paradiso” in what appears to be a stylized painting of a  cinema a wellheeled couple enters btc theater to watch the film “better money for all mankind” this is just the static image when you point your phone at the painting and use an app called artivive suddenly the theater springs to life cars from the  zoom into the frame and as the theater’s curtains dramatically move to the side dollar bills come flying towards your face it’s coolthe only problem with the tech is that once you get used to this augmented reality artwork you then expect it elsewhere and you start holding your phone up to nonar paintings which are just regular paintings and you feel like an old man who’s asking a printer to send his emailsome of the tech is less successful next to one drawing is a handwritten note saying “scan nfc tag” which requires you to first download an app called nfc reader along with a few other baffled art viewers i downloaded the app scanned the code and nothing happened we clicked and clicked and kept staring at a black screen “i don’t want to do  steps to see the art” said the woman next to me and turned away in frustration the future of art might enthrall but the future still has some work to dothe crypto mayorit’s tough to overstate the role of art in miami’s crypto scene for obvious pandemicrelated reasons in december  the flagship art basel was canceled crypto filled the void “we decided that in lieu of art basel we’d have a ‘bitbasel’” says scott spiegel miami community lead of the florida blockchain business association and a cofounder of bitbasel “and this was before nfts really went vertical and mainstream”you could even argue that bitbasel helped fuel the nft craze bitbasel’s inaugural event held in early december included heavy hitters in the space including devin finzer from opensea alexander salnikov from rarible and roham gharegozlou from dapper labs developer of nba top shot “then we just continued the meetups educating artists here locally” says spiegel the focus is on helping artists monetize their worktake wynwood the bright colorsplattered artsy neighborhood that’s lined with bold graffiti artists often do this work for free “we’re working with local graffiti artists in wynwood to tokenize those walls whether we slap a qr code on the wall or add an augmented vr or ar element” says spiegel they’re working with local schools in miami to integrate vr into art classes and they’re tokenizing a giant  foot graffiti mural “bitcoin in miami” that will be featured at bitcoin the crypto community has flocked to florida despite its current regulatory framework not because of itthe locals say they’ve been doing this kind of stuff for years “a lot of  stuff happens in florida it has just never been publicized before” says sam armes director and president of the florida blockchain business association he attributes part of florida’s crypto boom to the “network effect” in the sense that there was already a quietly humming core community and this has enticed others to join now the media is playing catchupafter all as armes proudly reminds me florida is where laszlo hanyecz spent  btc on two papa johns pizzas for what is widely acknowledged as the first realworld transaction in bitcoin – or over  million in today’s prices many claim miami as the birthplace of ethereum and armes adds only partly joking “for all we know satoshi could have been a floridian”as for miami’s “cryptofriendly regulations” this is a bit more nuanced and misunderstood by many armes is working with the mayor’s office to push a cryptofriendly piece of legislation to fix what he calls the “espinoza problem” most famously summed up in a  coindesk column “bitcoin has a florida problem” by justin s wales where the state defined peertopeer bitcoin transactions as money transmissionsjeff wilser“it makes zero sense” says armes adding that the crypto community has flocked to florida despite its current regulatory framework not because of it he says it’s an exaggeration to put florida’s crypto laws in the same league as wyoming’s “but no one really wants to live in wyoming” says armes laughing a bit he describes florida’s regulatory environment as not the best not terrible but just “middle of the pack”what miami lacks in crypto laws it makes up for in its cryptotouting mayor some trace miami’s recent tech boom to dec   when a silicon valley venture capitalist named delian asparouhov joked on twitter “ok guys hear me out what if we move silicon valley to miami” mayor suarez instantly responded “how can i help” the tweet went viral and launched “miami viral”mayor francis suarez is so bullish on bitcoin he makes microstrategy ceo michael saylor look like a skeptic suarez endorsed the idea of miami using its city coffers to invest in bitcoin he wants to accept tax payments in bitcoin he bought bitcoin and ether and he tweets out a constant stream of positive bitcoin news celebrating headlines like “bitcoin is coming to hundreds of us banks this year” and of course he’s rocking the laser eyesor as anthony “pomp” pompliano another prominent crypto florida resident tweeted in early may “the miami mayor is talking about mining bitcoin with nuclear energy and you still live in a city or state that hates bitcoin and the crypto industry open your eyes leadership matters come to miami ”and now the evidence is in a study from axios found that in the midst of  tech workers fled the higherpriced cities of san francisco new york and seattle there was one clear winner a city that saw a  yearoveryear growth in tech workers miamicrypto unmaskedback at the expo i meet case after case of people who came to miami – from across the country – to dive more deeply into crypto and they’re not all traders or bros take tayga nicole albert a dancer and model who has performed for national basketball association teams las vegas clubs and burlesque shows during the pandemic she ditched her normal life and bought a van to roam the country allowing her to focus more on her personal dancing so why is she strolling through the halls of the expo peeking at the crypto booths “i wanted to see if there’s a way to monetize my dancing with nfts” she saysthen there’s rachel steplo a creative consultant and real estate appraiser who lives in chicago her introduction to crypto came years ago when she was a bartender and kept serving beer to a few  who always tipped her an absurd amount “we’re bitcoin rich” the kids explained and she’s been intrigued ever since “i know this is the future” says steplo who flew to the expo to make connections in the space with an eye towards getting a job in crypto and moving to miami she has already pocketed one offertatiana moroz never feels far away flitting through the crowd and hugging and greeting laughing and lowkey filming footage for her upcoming reality show “bitcoin city” this newly arrived floridian is somehow one of the belles of the ball introducing me to the scene’s notables such as aaron koenig a blockchain entrepreneur who is organizing an upcoming crypto art fair in tulum mexico koenig has created a crypto hall of fame with artwork devoted to the likes of vitalik buterin hal finney and nick szabo koenig splits his time between playa del carmen and miami drawn like many to both the crypto scene and the high quality of lifemiami skyline jeff wilserkoenig is also drawn like many to the looser  restrictions “the best thing politicians can do is not to be in the way of entrepreneurs” koenig tells me “luckily authorities in florida have not been infected by the ‘coronoia’ virus that endangers our freedom so the crypto scene here could develop naturally”many here feel the same way including – and perhaps especially – tatiana moroz who literally sings songs about her freedoms “i’m actually pretty mad at new york” she says citing what she feels to be excessive restrictions like compulsory mask wearing when outdoors by yourself “i’m like you guys suck now you ruined it” editor’s note this was before the centers for disease control eased its guidelines on outdoor mask wearing in may politics loom over the expo just as they loom over so much of life the left has widely criticized florida’s republican governor ron desantis for his laissezfaire approach to the pandemic – less restrictions to indoor dining opening schools sooner and suspending all restrictions on may  declaring “we are no longer in a state of emergency” critics call this reckless but others point out that florida is doing no worse in number of coronavirus cases than the nation as a whole “florida is  in the us in covid deaths per capita and  in the us in covid cases per capita in other words pretty much right at the average” observes the data guru nate silver “there are a lot of bad takes about florida”and it’s tough to untwine the looser restrictions from the lure of the miami nightlife “should we take my car and get drinks” moroz asks a few of her friends and it seems like everyone at the expo is her friend we quickly agree we pile into her car and head to a bar called the anderson where a faux beach bungalow gives some retro  miami vibesthe bar feels like a parallel universe without  in most of the bars in denver where i live every other table is blocked off with a strict policy of no mingling disclosure especially when the cases were high and vaccinations are low i agree with this policy here in miami people mingle people smile they talk to strangers it’s a glimpse of the past and the future the air is warm the mood is festive and i can easily see the appealthe bitcoin bull run dominates the conversation only weeks later in the wake of the bitcoin price musk meltdown this conversation reads differently “you know the supercycle theory right” says one cryptorich investor referring to the uberbullish theory that bitcoin will crack  million before most think possible another flush crypto investor muses about renouncing his us citizenship to leave the country before his cryptomillions become cryptobillions “you pay an ‘exit tax’ when you renounce” he explains and worries that if he doesn’t make the move soon the us will just “take more money that can be used to wage a war”in the end and in what is likely a preview of bitcoin  the conference feels like not just a return to a precovid world but also crypto’s return to the frothy and glory days of  and early  – for better or worse we know how that endedthere will be more drinking celebrating even partying on one night a bus whisks people to a secret location for a warehouse party on another back at the intercontinental moroz helps close out the expo with a performance of songs from her new album “love songs for idiots”by then my initial questions have mostly been answered the crypto enthusiasm is real as are all the accompanying pros and cons all of the campaigns to bring people to miami – the tweets the grassroots billboards in new york’s times square the word of mouth – are working but will miami pass what i call the “uber test” this is a highly scientific gauge of a city’s blockchain sentiment where i ask my uber drivers if they’re familiar with crypto“am i into crypto” the uber driver says as if i asked him something as basic as “are you into food” through the mirror he looks at me and says “i used my stimulus check to buy some most of my friends did the same”he asks me if i’ll come back to miami anytime soon
