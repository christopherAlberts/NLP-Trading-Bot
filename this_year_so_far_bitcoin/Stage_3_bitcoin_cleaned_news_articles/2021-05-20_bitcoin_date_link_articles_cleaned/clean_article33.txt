hello again in a rumbustious week of trading on wall street one big question that seems to be emerging is this is sentiment in crypto influencing the mood in traditional financial marketsthe jury is out but a lot of folks seem inclined to draw parallels between risk appetite in the nascent digitalasset market and sentiment in stocks and bondsread why is crypto crashing will bitcoin prices ever recover here’s what traders and investors sayas per usual send tips or feedback and find me on twitter at mdecambre to tell me what we need to be jumping onsign up here for etf wrapwhat happened this week we promise that we won’t be talking about crypto on wrap every week but it is becoming a more pervasive talking point as one of the year’s hottest trades appears to be coming off the boiland interestingly researchers at jpmorgan chase jpm  this week made the case that investors are shifting from bitcoin btcusd  to gold it’s a thesis that seemingly has its challenges since the assumption is that bitcoin and gold investors don’t mix wellsee bitcoin’s  crash ‘does feel like capitulation’ says crypto specialist but here’s where the next crucial support level standsjpmorgan says that “the bitcoin flow picture continues to deteriorate and is pointing to continued retrenchment by institutional investors” and those investors are gravitating from bitcoin futures    which the report says “experienced their steepest and most sustained liquidation since the bitcoin ascent started last october” and into bullion   what’s fascinating is that the top performing etfs this week among those screened by marketwatch are those for gold and silver minersthe etfmg prime junior silver miners etf is up nearly  so far this week through midday thursday for example the global x silver miners etf was up  and vaneck vectors junior gold miners etf was showing a more than  return thus farthere isn’t an etf exclusively for companies that digitally mine for bitcoin miners…yet but riot blockchain

average etf iyt  will be undergoing a renovation this summerthe  billion etf tracks the priceweighted dow jones transportation average djt  and is viewed as an important gauge of the health of the market and the economy tracking an index that is even older than the dow jones industrial average djia  rather than track the  transportation and airfreight companies on a priceweighted basis the etf will now track  companies including uber technologies inc uber  and lyft inc lyft  on a marketcap weighted basiswhy it matters the change is a big deal because the transports are part of one of the oldest methods of technical analysis of the market called dow theory which holds that any lasting rally to new highs in the dow industrials must be accompanied by a new high in the dow jones transportation averageit will be interesting to see how investors respond to that changeis there a spac for thatperhaps the only thing buzzier than crypto over the past  months has been spacs or specialpurpose acquisition companies in  spacs have raised nearly  billion in initial public offerings — more than the amount spac ipos raised from  to  combinedhowever the spac phenomenon which became a popular way for companies to be taken public is suffering a powerful downturn but that hasn’t stopped the rollout of a new fund pegged to the spac crazetuttle capital management earlier this week launched the short despac etf sogu   which aims to benefit from declines in the spac marketcomments from the securities and exchange commission who said they were reviewing the accounting behind spacs and their issuance also helped to add to the chill in the spacethe defiance next gen spac derived etf spak  is down  over the past three months and down  so far this yearso a fund that would bet against the universe of companies that have been taken public through a spac is either late or right on timechart of the weekthis table highlights the increasing focus on bank stocks in this phase of the recovery from the covid pandemicthe wall street journal recently wrote that about  billion has been poured into broad financial stocks this year citing data from bank of america strategists“the biggest factor driving flows into the financials has been a belief that  marks a secular low point so far as interest rates and inflation” wsj quotes michael hartnett chief investment strategist at bank of america as saying
