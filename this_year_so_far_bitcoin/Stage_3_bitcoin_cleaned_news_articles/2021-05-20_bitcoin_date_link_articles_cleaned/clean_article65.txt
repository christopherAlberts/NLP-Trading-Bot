as bitcoin and others have been gaining acceptance more countries are allowing them but expect to see increased regulationkeremyucel getty imagesistockphotoamid the roller coaster ride that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are taking after the peoples bank of china announced this week that digital tokens cannot be used as a form of payment by financial institutions many investors remain undaunted yet while many countries accept cryptocurrencies there are notable exceptionscurrently all advanced and major economies allow the holding of crypto assets said ganesh viswanathnatraj an assistant professor of finance at the warwick business school university of warwick they include the us almost everywhere in the eu japan and south korearegulations differ across countries in terms of trading on cryptocurrency exchanges said viswanathnatraj who researches cryptocurrencies for example in china it is illegal to mine bitcoin and to trade on crypto exchangessee  apps for trading cryptocurrencies like bitcoin dogecoin and ethereum techrepublicthe pboc recently issued a warning to banks and online payment firms to not offer services involving cryptocurrency exchange trading and settlement he said reasons for the crackdown include the introduction of chinas central bank digital currency as a public competitor to cryptocurrency and the lack of traceability of cryptocurrency paymentsbesides china other countries such as india and nigeria have recently made headlines for the attempts by their central banks to ban the use of cryptocurrencies said jason allegrante head regulatory counsel  chief compliance officer at fireblocks a crypto lending platformindia announced a bill in march  that calls for a ban on trading viswanathnatraj added the bill gives permission for crypto traders to liquidate positions within six months he saidreasons for the ban include the lack of traceability and has the potential for tax evasion and black market uses for crypto payments he said the ban on cryptos is in line with indias demonetization policies of phasing out large rupeedenominated bills that may typically be used in the black market economyother countries like brazil and some individual us states are taking a different approach refusing to categorize digital assets as being either within or without existing frameworks allegrante said in between there is a vast middle ground of countries attempting to legitimately understand and engage with these technologies he saidunlike fiat currencies which are issued and controlled by a central bank cryptocurrencies have essentially sidestepped the question of governmental permissioning altogether allegrante said the question for any country assessing the space now should not be whether cryptocurrencies are allowed but what steps if any they should take to promote or delay their adoptionthere are countries that have adopted a strategy of trying to control the spread of cryptocurrencies and defend the role of the central bank he said unfortunately these countries run the risk of being left behind by more progressive jurisdictions that are learning how to adopt deploy and harness digital asset technologywhy reaction differsevery country that regulates cryptocurrencies takes a somewhat different approach depending on their unique concerns allegrante said countries that receive a lot of remittance payments may be interested in promoting the use of highly liquid highly fungible assets like bitcoin traditional financial centers may be more open by their nature to capital markets activity and may therefore attract exchanges offering a variety of digital assets classes with few rules for qualified investorshow a country reacts to cryptocurrencies in general and any particular crypto asset class in particular really depends on their own assessment of their historical strengths and weaknesses and their priorities for their citizens he saidany country with a vested interest in the postbretton woods monetary system is right to approach cryptocurrencies cautiously because their promise could be incredibly disruptive if ever fully realized allegrante saidwhat has been fascinating to watch is that many societies in the west who benefit from this system appear to be quite open to innovation he said in any event we should count on countries to act in their perceived best interest and these can run the gamut from retail consumer protection to systemic monetary risk managementmore regulation is comingmembers of the us congress have advocated for the stable act which would require socalled stablecoins to establish a banking charter and require approval from the fdic and have deposits fdic insured viswanathnatraj said the goal is to help protect consumers from the custodial risk of the issuerallegrante is predicting that regulation of cryptocurrencies will increase across the board driven by a number of critical market factors first influential international standardsetting bodies like fatf view cryptocurrencies as within their purview to regulate and will force the issue among their member states he said second market forces are leading to increased adoption and awareness of cryptocurrencies the strength of this trend is the institutional adoption of traditional banks and corporations like tesla as much as retail interestalso we are at the very outset of a new geopolitical arms race that may very well pit defenders of usd as the worlds reserve currency against new cryptobased competition statesponsored and otherwise allegrante said it is too soon to say how this will play out or what its ramification will be but â€¦ it seems likely that cryptocurrencies will continue to be a hot button topic this year and for the foreseeable futuretech news you can use
