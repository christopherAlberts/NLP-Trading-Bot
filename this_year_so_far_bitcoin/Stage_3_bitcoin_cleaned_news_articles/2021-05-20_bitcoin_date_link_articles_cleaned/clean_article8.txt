graphic yahooin the life of every cryptocurrency investor there inevitably comes a time when they watch a significant amount of their money disappear in the span of a few hours or days often the wait is not long — crypto crashes are so common there’s even a word for what steadfast believers steeling themselves try to do in the face of their inevitable feelings of panic hodl the term comes from a typo for “hold”and so it was this week when bitcoin collapsed from a high close to  last month to  shortly after  am wednesday morning — having dropped nearly  percent from the previous day — dragging the rest of the crypto market down with it on coinbase the largest us crypto exchange every single one of the dozens of digital assets available to trade was down an average of more than  percent — except for two cryptocurrencies pegged to the us dollar which rose just slightly to  it’s the kind of carnage that made the crypto markets look like the stockexchange ticker on black mondayit was hard to pinpoint exactly what caused the selloff some blamed elon musk who had turned the market bearish last week when he said tesla would stop accepting bitcoin as payment while others attributed it to china’s newly expanded ban on cryptocurrency banking still others figured cryptocurrency was just being swept into the plunge in tech stocks as investors tried to dump risky investments amid worries that inflation will soon make a comebackof course the crash also came at a time when there were more firsttime cryptocurrency investors — from financial institutions and companies that have loaded up on bitcoin to dogecoin buyers — for whom this may have been their first experience with a major dip though the crash at the end of  led to a bear market that lasted years what some in the industry refer to as “crypto winter” earlier investors remember the  drawdown of  percent in a single day the price then stalled around the same level for about six weeks before taking off on an epic bull run wednesday’s collapse in crypto prices had many asking is this the start of another bear winter for bitcoin or just a blip of a scare before the next alltime highchris burniske a founder and partner of placeholder a vc firm that invests directly in digital assets including nitcoin and ethereum and the former crypto lead at ark investment management says the angst reminded him of a parable about an earthquake witnessed both by elders and kids who’d never experienced one before “the little kids were freaking out that ‘the world is about to end what’s going on’” burniske says “and the elders are like ‘no no it’s an earthquake it happens now and again’“for the veterans in the space this is an earthquake it’s a pretty bad earthquake but we’ll survive you don’t think it’s the time to sell it’s the time to hodl”burniske believes that we’re in the “midcycle” phase of a larger uptrend for crypto — not at the bottom or in a true bear market nor at the top “and this will be one of those days that people reflect on from the cycle ‘remember may  that was crazy’ it will harden the veterans it will spook some people forever but the quality projects will make it through” those survivors will include bitcoin and ethereum among others he thinksstill it’s hard to predict whether bitcoin goes up or down from here at least in the coming days and weeks because bitcoin produces no revenue and has no underlying business model it’s pointless to apply traditional wall street methods to come up with a value for what it should be worthrather the best investors often rely on price analysis looking at how investor behavior influences the market trajectory to predict where bitcoin is going next jc parets who specializes in such analysis and distributes his research at his firm all star charts has been applying the fibonacci sequence — the additive pattern that dictates natural proportions in everything from seashells to spiral staircases — to correctly forecast the direction of bitcoin for yearsearlier this year after bitcoin passed  parets predicted that it was headed for  a level it hit less than a month later parets’s analysis showed that the next target bitcoin was headed for was  — unless it dropped back below  in which case it was likely to fall back to  after dipping under  on sunday bitcoin hit  wednesday morning“if  breaks the next level is ” parets saysso far though bitcoin is acting like  was a floor — it quickly bounced back from that price and is currently trading around  it’s like investors collectively decided  was low enough that they’d be willing to buy in at that price and many likely did perhaps even setting automatic orders to purchase bitcoin when it crossed that threshold“it was a logical place to bounce” says parets “the market is symmetrical and fractal humans are the irrational ones we crazy humans run the show”besides watching for which side of  bitcoin stays on burniske says he’s paying close attention to whether bitcoin is above or below its  moving average which is currently around  by thursday midday bitcoin was trading at almost exactly that level and the shortterm prognosis for the cryptocurrency looked uncertain heading back to  seemed possible before another upswing“there’s a chance people want to retest that bottom” burniske says look out below
