the cryptocurrency market has experienced a strong shock in recent days culminating in bitcoin’s flash crash to  yesterdaywhile looking for the reasons for this extremely bearish price action the cryptocurrency community saw several technical indicators and patterns that could be heralds of what was about to happenone of them is the wyckoff distribution this pattern is used in traditional financial markets to describe the peak of a bull market distribution or the bottom of a bear market accumulationthe interpretation by youtube user uncomplication who compared the btc price action from the last few months to the wyckoff distribution was particularly insightful the most interesting fact is that the youtuber published his analysis on april   days before yesterday’s crashit is also worth recalling the signal that the community received about a month ago from the pi cycle top indicator and the deepening fear on the market which reached the extremely low value of  points the fear and greed index has recorded such extreme readings only  times in its historywhat is the wyckoff diagramthe wyckoff diagram is a pattern in technical analysis that has gained popularity in the analysis of traditional financial marketsits creator was richard wyckoff  a famous investor in the stock markets and creator of magazine of wall street he is one of the pioneers of modern technical analysisa typical wyckoff pattern consists of a series of sharp up and down price movements that create some elongated distribution one of the tops of the diagram is the peak for this period of price action followed by an accelerated declinewyckoff distribution pattern  source schoolstockchartscomto get the most out of the wyckoff diagram it needs to be identified correctly this is done using trading ranges price volatility and trading volume following this identification the appropriate buyingselling decisions can be madestory continuesthe main principle here is gradual selling during the distribution period and gradual purchasing during the accumulation period which is approximately the opposite of the distribution patternthe btc correction resembles over the past  hours many members of the crypto community have drawn attention to the similarities in the bitcoin price action over the past few months to the wyckoff distribution patternmost of them referred to the almost prophetic video by uncomplication he diagnosed this pattern almost a month agofor example the cryptocurrency trader kingthies posted a juxtaposition of two variations of the wyckoff distribution with a linear bitcoin chart on twitter he highlighted the key levels of the trading range resistance support and the main phases of the distribution itselfsource twitteralso crypto market analyst benjamin cowen published an analysis of the potential wyckoff pattern in the context of his prediction of an intermediate peak in this bitcoin bull runhe argues that whether it results from a realized distribution or a mere reaction to an overheated market many signals indicated that the ongoing run could significantly improve correctionsource youtubeknown for using mathematical analysis tools cowen has repeatedly compared the current bull market to the price action from two cycles ago during this period bitcoin’s exponential increase led to a deeper correction it then continued its upward move to a new alltime high set a few months laterthis idea about the similarities between the current cycle and the  period seems to also be supported by the wellknown investor and bitcoin bull raoul palin a tweet today he published a chart that compares the bitcoin price from these two bull markets as it turns out the similarities are indeed visiblesource twitterwas the pi cycle eventually righthowever it was not only the wyckoff distribution that turned out to be a harbinger of the coming drop it is also worth mentioning the pi cycle top indicator which beincrypto wrote about during its recent intersectionin retrospect it turned out that it had predicted the local top of the bull run very accurately again despite many not believing it on the day it crossed this simple indicator is based on the movements of two curves twice the  dma and the  dmatheir last intersection took place on april  just  days before the alltime high at btc chart by tradingviewinterestingly a few days later the curves made another intersection also today they are again far apart at around this means that if the market is to bounce soon and the bullish sentiment returns the indicator would again be ready to point to a potential peakextreme fear – low riskfinally pay attention to the behavior of the fear and greed index it is currently at its lowest levels since the  crisis today when market sentiment responds to yesterday’s crash its value has dropped to current readings of the fear and greed index  source alternativemethis is an extremely low level of the indicator such a low rating has only been recorded only  times since its inception orange circleshistorical readings of the fear and greed index  source alternativemeextremely negative sentiment in the crypto market may indicate that the correction is not over yetany possible consolidation may take months however this indicator should be a good suggestion for new investors that now is the right time to consider taking positions with much lower risk compared to a month ago
