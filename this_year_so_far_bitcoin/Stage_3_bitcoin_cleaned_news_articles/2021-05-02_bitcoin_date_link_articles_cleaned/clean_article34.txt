bitcoin mixers are used to work on the transactions so that tracing them becomes difficult or even impossible in general btc transactions are very easy to track which makes them difficult to be used for illicit purposes but with the use of these mixers the original crypto address and the ones in use becomes different this hides the personal information of the sender or receiver and this is why they are banned in exchanges and many other regulated platformspeople think bitcoin is anonymousbitcoin is not anonymous and its transactions can be easily tracked this is the reason that anyone doing any form of illicit activities makes use of a bitcoin mixer this has even been proved by the authorities of the us which arrested a darknetbased btc mixing service operator just after analyzing  years worth of blockchain data they were able to find out who he was if it’s possible to arrest the owner of a mixing service anyone using the service can also be easily caught so it’s not recommendednote that the bitcoin addresses that are used for transactions and their details stay up on the blockchain forever and these addresses do not actually have the ip addresses and other personal data of the user but often the transactions are tied to any form of good or service they were paid for and give away the sender and receiver even in the case of the bitcoin mixing service the owner was caught as the us authorities were able to link hosting expenses paid using the currencybecoming anonymous with mixingthere are many solutions available on the internet that make it possible for anyone to go anonymous on the internet some of the solutions are centralized and some are decentralized and offer similar services but it is obvious that decentralized services are much better for privacy reasons of users there is a good chance that a data leak of centralized exchanges could lead to loss of anonymity of the usersthere are many platforms that offer decentralized solutions to this but these are also not exactly untraceable but yeah the higher number of users in the same the difficult it becomes to trace the transactions many wallets and exchanges also take advantage of this to make sure that the privacy of users is intact but centralized exchanges have to comply with the government and thus require the transactions to be completely traceable and therefore it is not possible for the exchanges to allow for the usage of such mixersdoes it make sense for the exchanges to ban the use of bitcoin mixers it is not always necessary that they are used for illicit purposes many could make use of these mixers to get a certain level of privacy what are your thoughts on the same let us know in the comments below also if you found our content informative do like it and share it with your friendsalso read what is ethereum  and why is it important
