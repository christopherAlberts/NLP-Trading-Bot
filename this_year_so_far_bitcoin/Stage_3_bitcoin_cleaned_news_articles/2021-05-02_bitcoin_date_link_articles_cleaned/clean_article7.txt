peter wolfendale is a philosopher based at newcastle university in the united kingdom his interests range from metaethics to artificial intelligence he was a founding voice in one of the truly original branches of thought that found expression on the internet leftaccelerationism as well as a pioneering figure in the blogosphere suffice it to say if it’s on the cutting edge wolfendale has thoughts about itcoindesk reached out to wolfendale for an interview about bitcoin to ask why it’s a tool for emancipation how it reproduces existing forms of prejudice and what it might mean for the future of capitalism here is what he had to sayhow does your interest in philosophy intersect with bitcoinsubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policyfor the better part of the last decade my work has been driven by the idea that philosophy of mind and philosophy of artificial intelligence are essentially the same thing to understand what it would be to create systems that are generally intelligent and practically autonomous in the way we are is essentially to understand what we are ourselvesthis intellectual journey convinced me that philosophy of computer science isn’t a niche subfield but a lens through which the others need to be understood not only are individual human beings already computational but so are the social political and economic systems that we’ve built for and out of ourselvesit’s impossible not to be awed by the ambition of the cryptocurrency community to reinvent money for the age of planetaryscale distributed computation it’s also impossible to deny that it’s made a lot of concrete progress in a short space of time but my job is to see if they’re guided by the right abstract questions about money and similar social institutions and to tentatively suggest some better oneswhat are the most exciting things happening in cryptosome people are excited by crypto as a source of roi return on investment others are excited by it as a way of designing and implementing new sorts of social organization these aren’t mutually exclusive and a lot of people are motivated by both but there’s an understandable tendency to overestimate how compatible they are and the resulting hype can push the ecosystem in questionable directionspeter wolfendalethe obvious example here is nfts nonfungible tokens which are really interesting from a technological perspective but are caught up in exactly the wrong sort of excitement they’re a direct demonstration that scarcity is a precarious substitute for usevalue the really exciting things are better ways to handle anonymity decentralization and coordination from a feature perspective that means the spread of zeroknowledge proofs systems optimized for dapps and multichain interoperability and mature proofofstake protocols with onchain governanceyou’ve said in the past that bitcoin is more or less recreating existing monetary phenomena – from banks to bank fraud is there a way to develop an alternative monetary framework that doesn’t repeat errors or make things worsepeople often say that money does three jobs a medium of exchange a store of value and a unit of account bitcoin started out as a decentralized medium of exchange but it’s not really very good at that instead it’s become popular as a store of value not so much digital gold coins as a distributed fort knoxthis is predicated on the belief that at some point it’ll become stable enough relative to other assets to function as a unit of account the problem here is that it’s less about bitcoin being good at this job than a selffulfilling prophecy driven by network effectsmoney also quantifies privilege it gives you access to a certain share of the output of the whole system of production a share you earn by having a stake in that system these aren’t the only sorts of privileges that can be quantified if you acquire shares in a company you don’t just get dividends you get votesin liberal democratic states political control and economic activity are nominally separate but your stake in the system as a whole gets you a nontransferable token you can spend in elections to rebalance its overhead eg taxes and spending a major reason this model is decaying is that monetary sovereignty is less and less able to manage this balancesee also opinion – why bitcoin needs philosophyhow and why are matters of extreme controversy but it’s clear to me that any improved social contract liberal or postliberal will need to rethink the relationship between currency geography and accounting precious metals printing presses and tbtf too big to fail banks aren’t going to cut ityou’ve said “scarcity is a blunt instrument with which to build financial infrastructure” considering the current macroeconomic landscape of easy money and low rates what is the alternativethe scarcity we should be interested in isn’t in the money supply but in the output of the economy the goods and services we consume are we more interested in conserving our share of this output than in the quantity quality and sustainability of that output as a wholethe banking ecosystem is responsible for securing value in the physical and social infrastructure that lets us live our lives it’s pretty obvious to many of us that it’s no longer doing this job well it’s progressively geared towards creating opportunities for rent extraction and minimizing risk for protected classes of investors there’s no real trust in these institutions even if we’ve no choice but to rely on themmoney is power and power has a nasty tendency to ratchet itselfif defi decentralized finance wants to be better it needs to do more than guarantee our share of the pie will remain stable as the pie slowly rots over timethere’s not one simple trick for doing this but here are two lines of thought riffing on existing organizational formswe should encourage unmediated supplydemand negotiation in which consumers invest directly in productsservices ie crowdfundingwhere it must be mediated by institutions that generate lines of credit by minting tokens we should develop more finegrained ways to check their lending decisions than forking or divestment like switching from a bank to a credit uniontokens are more versatile than legacy units of account and we should use them to build more decentralized and transparent successors to the fractional reserve modelis bitcoin actually a tool for reducing inequalitynot as far as i can see any currency system which is optimized to fight inflation and act as a store of value is going to preserve and heighten inequalities in the long run and this is before we talk about relative energy costs and related environmental externalitiesat the end of the day money is power and power has a nasty tendency to ratchet itself unless it’s checked in some way decentralization isn’t a sufficient check all on its ownyou’ve been critical of some aspects of the bitcoin worldview which requires a high degree of individual responsibility this is perhaps best exemplified by the phrase “be your own bank” what are the issues of switching responsibility for personal wealth from banks to individuals or of trust minimization across the webthe problem is that most people can’t be their own banks one aspect of this is technical competence which can be mitigated by better software and cultural change the other is physical protection and insurance though cryptography and software verification can seriously narrow down the range of possible attack vectors on your assets they can’t eliminate them entirely anonymity helps but only so much we’re social creatures after allthe old adage that crypto is a playground for marketoriented libertarians has been challenged by the recent bout of conservative corporations like insurers and wall street giants buying up bitcoin how will this trend play out will there be room for cypherpunks in  yearshonestly it’s hard to say but the two types of excitement i talked about earlier are going to increasingly pull apart and this is going to feed into a much wider debate about cypherpolitics current arguments are split between three camps  the market is good and big business can be trusted with your data cyphercapitalists  big business can’t be trusted with your data but big government can be cypherliberals and cyphertankies and  neither of them can be trusted with your data and it’s up to you to find the tools needed to protect your own privacy cypherpunks
