opinion bitcoin’s price is extremely volatile it ended the last seven days a full  per cent above the week’s low point such dramatic moves within short periods are not unusual and make it much more volatile than share investments – bitcoin’s  per cent move compares to moves closer to  per cent for the new zealand and us share marketsregardless of the volatility some financial institutions and corporates like jp morgan microsoft morgan stanley and tesla are taking bitcoin seriously leading investors to ponder whether bitcoin is the currency and investment of the future but we should also be pondering whether energy demands from bitcoin mining are positive for our planet’s futureif bitcoin was a country it would be one of the  largest countries ranked by electricity usage it would rank slightly ahead of norway which has a population marginally larger than new zealandthis is because mining new bitcoins consumes immense amounts of power google is a large company with  employees and powerhungry data centres worldwide yet bitcoin mining consumes ten times as much powerunlike mining conventional resources bitcoin are ‘mined’ when computers solve complex algorithms and new bitcoin are released as a reward mining new coins has become increasingly hard requiring ever greater amounts of computational power and energyin a world concerned with climate change burning coal to generate power for bitcoin mining is questionable if not crazy according to a university of cambridge study just over  per cent of power for bitcoin mining comes from nonrenewable sourcessome of the biggest brains in investing and innovation think bitcoin’s immense power needs could be positivea recent paper supported by elon musk from tesla and cathie wood from ark claims bitcoin mining is an ideal complement to solar or wind power projects especially if backed by batterystorage technologyit’s argued that where proposed largescale renewable plants in europe asia and the us are held back by concerns of power oversupply bitcoin can step up the belief is that bitcoin mining should be clustered near new renewables projects to solve electricity oversupply issues and encourage more green energy this claim is a stretchdrawing a link between bitcoin mining and the future growth of green energy seems a fanciful way to justify the massive amount of nonrenewable energy that bitcoin mining currently consumesputting its energy needs aside the value of bitcoin is ultimately as an investment or currency back in january the bitcoin price was   and we speculated that the price could easily double – or halve bitcoin nearly achieved this – from early january to midapril it rose close to  per cent before dipping over the last two weeksbitcoin’s strong price moves for investors both up and down have overall been very positive for longterm holders but with bitcoin mining’s massive nonrenewable power footprint it doesn’t feel like such an overwhelmingly positive story for our planetjohn berry is the chief executive at ethical fund manager and kiwisaver provider pathfinder asset management which is part of alvarium wealth
