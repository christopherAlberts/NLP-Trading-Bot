today i’m going to weave together three seemingly unrelated stories from the past week to highlight a trend that i believe we are largely overlooking readyfirst tesla’s  earnings release revealed the company sold  million worth of its bitcoin holdings in the first quarter according to its ceo elon musk it did so to test the market’s liquidity the  million it added to the company’s quarterly profit didn’t hurt eithersecond crypto lender genesis trading a subsidiary of dcg which is also the parent of coindesk published its   report which showed the amount of loans outstanding broke through  billion an increase of  from the previous quarteryou’re reading crypto long  short a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets authored by coindesk’s head of research noelle acheson it goes out every sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view you can subscribe herethird us federal reserve chairman jerome powell spoke about the macroeconomic environment holding firm to the expectation of an average of  inflation over the next few yearswhat do these three stories have to do with one another the answer lies in looking through the growing use of bitcoin as a reserve asset on corporate balance sheets to why companies want to do so today and why they are likely to want to do so in years to comebalance sheetsbefore we bring in this week’s narratives let’s refresh the balance sheet asset storycompanies investing in bitcoin as a reserve asset have usually cited value protection as the main reason bitcoin will hold its purchasing power against the inevitable debasement of fiat the argument goes since corporate treasury’s priority is ensuring the business has the funds it needs for operations and strategic investment today as well as in the future some advocates argue that bitcoin is an ideal treasury asset even though the volatility is a concernand then there’s tesla after a public backandforth on twitter between ceo elon musk and microstrategy ceo michael saylor expectations rose that tesla would soon join the ranks the company did not disappoint in february it announced a  billion bitcoin purchase its   earnings released this week showed the company sold approximately  of its holdings for  million musk explained on twitter this was to “test the market’s liquidity”this was a smart move on many counts one thing is liquidity on the way in we can assume the  billion purchase was executed carefully over the course of a few weeks another thing entirely is liquidity on the way out any corporate treasurer will need to feel comfortable that it can convert reserve assets into working capital at a moment’s notice tesla’s move will reassure other companies that liquidity risk need not be a main concernand the sale’s contribution of  million to the bottom line also sends a powerful message liquidating traditional “cash equivalents” generally does not produce much of an impact to net earnings with this move tesla is signaling that here is a “cash equivalent” serving a double function value preservation and potential profit with its substantial bitcoin position and crypto advocacy microstrategy transformed its business value proposition from software company to listed bitcoin proxy companies don’t have to go that far – with even a modest allocation to bitcoin they can maintain their core business but put in place a potential buffer when earnings look weakborrowing growthnow on to genesis’ loan book where us dollar usd and stablecoin loans more than doubled over the quarter demand for this type of loan is for now fueled mainly by the persistent basis trade opportunity in the bitcoin futures market going forward it’s likely to be powered by a growing understanding of the efficiency of bitcoin as collateral and the increasing amount of bitcoin ready to be used as collaterala lot of this bitcoin will be on corporate balance sheetstesla showed that exiting a sizable btc position is possible genesis showed that a btc position can raise working capital without creating a taxable event by acting as collateral for a fiat loanthis further boosts the case for holding bitcoin as a treasury asset initial interest may be driven by concerns about the longterm value of cash and cash equivalents a further boost is likely to come from the relative ease of raising capital with an asset unpegged to the economic cycleinflation expectationswhat us federal reserve chairman powell said earlier this week will help with inflation running persistently below the target average of  powell acknowledged that inflation will be allowed to run above that level for some time indeed the market’s inflation expectations as indicated by the  breakeven rate broke through  for the first time in over eight yearssource federal reserve bank of st louisthis is an alarming prospect in that it will lower the real value of money even more than the market has become accustomed to expecting so the prospect of inflation running above  for several years is likely to send corporate treasurers scurrying to find ways to protect assets from what microstrategy ceo michael saylor calls the “melting ice cube” effect and powell’s confirmation that quantitative easing will continue for the foreseeable future will underscore fears of fiat debasementthese trends could end up encouraging even more treasurers to put at least part of their corporate reserves into bitcoin this will create an even deeper pool of bitcoin ready to be used as collateralcollateral issuesand this is the deeper takeaway bitcoin’s potential use as collateral is just getting startedwe’ve already seen significant growth in the cryptobacked lending industry as exemplified in the genesis report mentioned above i don’t have a breakdown of just how much of that collateral is bitcoin but we can assume that it’s the bulk the same applies to the soaring use of crypto as collateral in the booming leveraged derivatives market and as my colleague brady dale reported this week the total market capitalization of decentralized finance defi tokens which represent lending and other financial applications has broken through  billion to reach an alltime high wrapped bitcoin an ethereumbased token  backed by bitcoin that was created to facilitate the cryptocurrency’s use as collateral in defi applications reached an alltime market cap high of  billion two weeks agobut all of this could end up being dwarfed by the use of bitcoin as a collateral asset in bilateral repo transactions the repo market in which corporations can use their liquid asset holdings to borrow shortterm cash for working capital needs and pledge as collateral “safe” securities such as us treasurys was estimated to be around  trillion at the end of last year with around  trillion of that attributable to nonbank and nonsecurities dealer firmsobviously bitcoin is not going to be nearly as liquid as the treasury market any time soon and it will almost certainly always be much more volatile but for overnight lending to corporations with operations in many different currencies bitcoin could start to be seen as an intriguing collateral alternative one that also has the potential to boost earnings when necessary and lenders could be drawn in by the easytotransfer bearer asset nature of the collateral not to mention the superior yield furthermore there’s the upside of holding an asset that will not be debased by a growing monetary supply and a climbing inflation ratethe market infrastructure for this is already being built by the crypto industry’s main lending services we could even see decentralized lending services start to offer repolike facilities banks traditionally key participants in repo markets are already getting more involved with crypto assets and regulators could find the transparency of blockchainbased collateral to be a refreshing change from the opaque and convoluted webs of ownership endemic to the market todaycrypto assets do bring a different type of risk to a fragile equation however and the concept of bitcoin as collateral has many hurdles to overcome before it can make a meaningful difference in today’s financial ecosystem but change is already underway in so many aspects of market plumbing and signs are pointing to a broader financial role for bitcoin than as “just” an asset on a balance sheetjpmorgan joins the crypto marketjpmorgan chase is preparing to offer an actively managed bitcoin fund to its private wealth clients possibly as soon as this summer according to sourcesmuch was made of the “aboutturn” this implies because in the past jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon called bitcoin “stupid” and has threatened to fire any trader caught dabbling in crypto markets if even jpmorgan is now embracing the crypto opportunity the narrative went then surely that means the institutions are poised to enter en massethe story is more nuanced than that thoughthese funds are being offered only to private wealth clients who have fewer regulatory hoops to jump through as opposed to pension funds and insurance companies for instance and who in theory can withstand a higher level of risk this will broaden involvement but is not exactly taking bitcoin “mainstream” by “actively managed” i assume they will try to beat the bitcoin market by also engaging in derivative and cash allocation strategies most funds are passive – they accumulate bitcoin and the funds’ value closely tracks that asset trying to beat the market with such a volatile asset is a risky strategy not just for the investors but also for the firm’s reputation the main takeaway here however is that a large bank like jpmorgan would not make a decision to spin up a product like this without serious consideration especially in light of dimon’s previous comments jpmorgan would do so after months of deliberation and careful planning and only after definite indication that its clients want this product that supports the growing interest we’re seeing from institutional and large investors and points to more strong inflows aheadchain linksus bank part of us bancorp the fifthlargest banking institution in the us announced this week it will offer a new cryptocurrency custody product in partnership with an unnamed subcustodian it also announced it has been selected to administer nydig’s bitcoin exchangetraded fund etf should it be approved by regulators takeaway these are heavyduty services which aren’t spun up at a moment’s notice – which means us bank has been working on this for some time it’s more than likely that many other traditional financial institutions have been doing the same behind closed doors pretty soon the list of traditional banks not involved in crypto will be shorter than the list of those that arespeaking of us bank it participated along with state street and other investors in a  million funding round for institutional cryptocurrency infrastructure firm securrency takeaway here we have two significant legacy financial institutions investing in a business that connects traditional services with crypto markets read into that what you will …genesis trading a subsidiary of dcg which is also the parent of coindesk published its   report this week which shows a staggering  growth in active loans to over  billion takeaway one of the many intriguing data points in this report is the growth of almost  in outstanding ether loans largely driven by yield and arbitrage opportunities in decentralized finance defi platforms btc loans as a percentage of the total outstanding declined from  to  still an absolute increase of approximately  in usd terms largely because of the disappearance of the profitable premium trade on grayscale’s gbtc bitcoin trust grayscale is also a subsidiary of dcg and the persistent spread between futures and spot markets which dissuades btc shortingcoinbase has delayed the launch of trading on stablecoin tether usdt until next month citing an ongoing issue with its professional platform’s api takeaway this is much more than just a frustrating tech glitch it’s a reminder of the crypto market’s retailfirst origin exchanges and services sprang up ad hoc over the past  years with no coordination so there is no industrywide technology standard for connectivity this will get fixed with time and investment but there is no “central body” to decide what the standards should bethe sec has pushed back making a decision on vaneck’s proposed bitcoin etf to at least june  takeaway while many have speculated that a bitcoin etf approval is likely in the us in the near future given the success of bitcoin and ether etfs in the canadian market and given chairman gary gensler’s familiarity with the crypto markets this delay is not a surprise the sec only has three of the  active proposals in front of it for review and it could choose to approve more than one at the same time to avoid granting first mover advantage and to give the market more choice
