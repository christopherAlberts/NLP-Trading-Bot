cryptocurrency investment research platform told insiderhere are three hurdles and tailwinds that experts say stand in front of the first us bitcoin etf bitcoin volatilitythe worlds most widely traded digital asset is wellknown for its wild price swings with gains or losses of  during a session not uncommonthe sec has a difficult job balancing the clearly overwhelming desire for the market to have access to btc via an etf versus the inherent volatility that the asset class has at this stage in its life cycle george mcdonaugh cofounder of digital asset investment firm  told insider volatility would be one of the major considerations bitcoin is very scarce and comparatively still a very young asset class the volatility should dampen over time but that might be long after the market loses patience waiting for price volatility has declined in recent weeks and such moves make bitcoin more appealing to institutions according to jpmorganliquidity in the bitcoin market had also been a factor under consideration by the seci think its less of a concern now  in the early days â€¦ and a lot of that is tied to institutional players coming into and creating depth and breadth in the market matteo dante perruccio president international of wave financial a usregulated digital asset manager told insider if its  retail investors in an asset and you open it up to a bigger universe of retail investors i think thats a really hard decision to make as a regulator but it helps you have substantive institutional investors trading and involved in investing in itread more binance ceo changpeng zhao breaks down how he built the worlds largest crypto exchange in  days  and shares why hes keeping most of his assets in bitcoin and binance coin market maturityits fair to say if you look at the denials for the last several etfs you can see that there was concern among several of the commissioners that the bitcoin market was not sufficiently regulated and in their view was susceptible to manipulation and when i say that i mean that manipulation would show up in prices amy doberman a partner in the securities department at law firm wilmerhale told insideri think what youre going to see with the pending requests for approval is an argument that the market is far more developed than it was four or five years ago and that theres a lot more price discovery available than there was even just a few years ago so that there will be the ability to reference actual trades and sufficient information to develop accurate prices said doberman whats on the secs platethe us lags behind other countries in approving bitcoin etfs with canada this year approving the first publicly traded bitcoin etf in north america the purpose bitcoin etf as well as ethereum etfs brazilian regulators have reportedly approved two bitcoin etfspeople underestimate the canadian approval said wave financials perruccio characterizing as close cousins the secs relationship with the canadian securities regulator the regulators have got to be talking a lot and  you always feel more comfortable in company when you are making these bold decisions and canadas regulator is considered as wellrespected he said for a us bitcoin etf i feel like its inevitable its no longer if but when and i think the question of when is probably in  thats my prediction said perrucciowhile bitcoin etf applications pile up the sec and its new chairman gary gensler have a range of other issues they are working on gensler who was confirmed as chairman earlier this month is seen by some bitcoin etf proponents as a cryptocurrency advocate stemming in part from his teachings at mit on the subjectgensler will have to decide what he wants to prioritize said doberman hes obviously very knowledgeable about cryptocurrencies and hopefully will bring an additional level of sophistication and appreciation for the currency to the table she saidduring his confirmation hearing gensler said the sec under his watch would review issues surrounding protection and fairness for retail investors in the backdrop of gamification on trading apps and platformsthe agency is reportedly considering stricter rules to rein in projections made by special purpose acquisition companies or spacs and reportedly has opened a preliminary investigation into leveraged trades at the archegos capital management hedge fund that collapsed in marchwhile hes wellversed in the subject of cryptocurrencies gensler who served as a chairman of the commodity futures trading commission under the obama administration will not just wave through bitcoin etfs applications without scrutiny said noah hamman ceo of advisorshares a firm that offers actively managed exchangetraded funds through its advisorshares trustgensler will be in the role of looking at the rules and regs and deciding if either one something fits or two do the rules and regs need to be modified to allow it to fit because it makes sense and its the right thing to do said hamman advisorshares does not have a bitcoin etf filing with the sec
