mountain view calif — google’s first office was a cluttered silicon valley garage crammed with desks resting on sawhorsesin  five years after its founding the company moved into a sprawling campus called the googleplex the airy open offices and whimsical common spaces set a standard for what an innovative workplace was supposed to look like over the years the amenities piled up the food was free and so were buses to and from work getting to the office and staying there all day was easynow the company that once redefined how an employer treats its workers is trying to redefine the office itself google is creating a postpandemic workplace that will accommodate employees who got used to working from home over the past year and don’t want to be in the office all the time anymorethe company will encourage — but not mandate — that employees be vaccinated when they start returning to the office probably in september at first the interior of google’s buildings may not appear all that different but over the next year or so google will try out new office designs in millions of square feet of space or about  percent of its global work spaces
