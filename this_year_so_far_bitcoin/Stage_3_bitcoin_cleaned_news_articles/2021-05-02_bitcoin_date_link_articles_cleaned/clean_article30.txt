bitcoin’s notorious volatility may have softened in the last year but don’t expect it to disappear altogetherafter hitting a previous peak of   in december  bitcoin fell  over the following year to a low of about   before recommencing its next bull run which took it to a new alltime high above   the exhilaration of these wild swings is what draws an evergrowing community of traders and riskhungry investors to bitcoinbitcoin has shown itself capable of dropping  in a day or two without disturbing its overall bull pattern this makes it a prized asset for traders seeking to profit from rapid price swingshowever there are great ways to make money in crypto without taking risk such as buying overseas and selling in south africa for a profit this practice is called arbitrage and is making south africans relatively riskfree profits find out more about arbitrage todayseveral factors are behind bitcoin’s volatilitythe news cycle us treasury secretary in february warned that bitcoin was an “extremely inefficient” way to conduct monetary transactions prompting a  drop in price but that was after elon musk announced his company tesla had bought  billion in bitcoin promoting a nearly  surge in price bitcoin is jittery around talk of restrictions and regulations but even when countries like china pakistan and nigeria have ramped up regulatory barriers to crypto entry usually by cutting ties between exchanges and the banking sector the price has quickly recovered from the bad newschanging perceptions around bitcoin’s store of value there will only ever be  million bitcoin issued so the supply is fixed notwithstanding its near infinite subdivisibility the only other factor that can change is demand which is influenced by investor perceptions of risk those perceptions remain acutely high at present due to the extraordinary level of money printing being undertaken in the us by the joe biden administration bitcoin has shown itself to be the fastest growing assets of the last decade and possibly of all timerate of adoption originally confined to techies and cryptographers bitcoin is now reckoned to have more than  million people who own or have owned the coin by some predictions crypto adoption will reach one billion with the next decade not all of these will be bitcoin holders but many will be countries with exchange controls and high inflation have seen a marked increase in adoption from citizens trying to protect their wealth against government currency debasementno central control authority this is a key factor in bitcoin volatility this is an attraction for many who regard central bank money printing programmes as the ultimate in monetary recklessness while others prefer to stay away from something that does not enjoy the oversight of central bank supervisorsbitcoin halvings the rate at which bitcoin is mined is halved every four years and this has been shown to have a profound impact on price the previous halving was in  and the next one is in  there is no direct correlation between halving and price though the previous two halvings preceded a major upward push in price over the following two yearsprice predictionsbitcoin has grown at an unbelievable  compound annual growth rate per year for the last decade which means it has very little correlation to traditional risk assetsthe fact that this has happened historically is certainly no guarantee the pattern will continue especially as we have already seen the potential for massive drawdowns but this does give us a benchmark against which to gauge future movements in priceovex ceo and founder jon ovadia sees a price north of   as an achievable target within the next five years “this is an achievable target given the expected increase in the rate of bitcoin adoption over the coming years and by some estimates may be on the conservative side either way it would be prudent for most investors to hold at least some bitcoin with a view to capitalising on the growth of this new financial architecture that will sweep the world over the next decade”ovex’s arbitrage serviceanother relatively safe way to gain entry to cryptocurrencies is through crypto arbitrage ovex was founded more than three years ago to offer companies and retail investors access to crypto arbitrage – making riskfree profits from price differences on cryptos in different markets cryptos like bitcoin can typically be bought on overseas exchanges and sold in sa at a slight premium generally between  and  rather than scouting arbitrage opportunities with bitcoin ovex found that arbitrage profits are more predictable using a stablecoin called trueusd which is backed  by the us dollar trueusd is issued by san franciscobased trusttokenthese arbitrage opportunities are available in most countries with exchange controls though the arbitrage gap varies depending on demand a stablecoin though backed by a regulated currency like the us dollar or rand is a crypto asset that is often used by investors to park profits made on other cryptos in a safe asset that does not move in tandem with the rest of the marketovex’s otc deskthe larger part of ovex’s business is an overthecounter otc desk that allows large buyers of crypto assets to get rapid settlement without the risk of moving the marketthis is important for companies or family offices that may be looking to
