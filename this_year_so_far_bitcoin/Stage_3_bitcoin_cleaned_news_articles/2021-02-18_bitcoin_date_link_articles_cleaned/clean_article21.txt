the us space agency nasa successfully landed its fifth terrestrial rover on mars on thursday eveningperseverance – a highlyadvanced  long robotic vehicle weighing more than a tonne – will scour the red planet’s surface for signs of ancient life and collect rock and soil samples for return to earthits landing came almost seven months after launching onboard the atlas  rocket from cape canaveral air force station in floridamission control at nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory kept watch as computers and sensors onboard the rover’s cruise and descent stages as well as other spacecraft around mars transmitted data on the progress of the entry descent and landing edl phase of the missionduring this time the team had to endure a socalled “seven minutes of terror” during which the descending spacecraft with the rover performs a sequence of risky actions that happens faster than signals can reach earthhow it happenedat an altitude of around  kilometres above mars the heatprotective carbon fibre aeroshell capsule carrying the rover entered mars’s atmospherethe heat shield’s surface reached a peak temperature of  degrees celsius upon descentafter slowing down to a speed of  kilometres per hour a  wide supersonic parachute was deployed to slow the craft downhowever because of mars’s thinner atmosphere this would not be enough to stop the rover from hitting the ground at an excessive speedat  seconds after parachute deployment the capsule shed its heat shield allowing the exposed rover to scan the terrain below for features which it could compare to an onboard map provided by engineers which included the safest landing sitesstill travelling at around  the craft then cut off the parachute and released its back shell before an eight engine jetpack attached above the rover fired up its thrustersit swerved to avoid the falling shell and parachute and then continued its descent using sophisticated programming before lowering perseverance to the ground using cables – a manoeuvre dubbed as the skycranethe rover hit the ground at a speed of the team erupted in cheers after operations lead swati mohan confirmed touchdown at around  south african timeit should be noted that this was actually more than  minutes after the rover had landed due to the delay in communication caused by the great distance to marsthe images below show illustrations of what the entry descent and landing may have looked likefirst imagesafter its landing the rover captured three images using its onboard rear right hazardavoidance camerathe first image’s transmission appears to have been corrupted but the other two showed clear imagery of the ground and several rocks in the vicinity of the roversubsequent photos are expected to be of much greater quality as these will be taken with cameras that were still protected during the landingbelow are two of three images perseverance sent back to earth shortly after landingnow read spacex rocket booster landing fails after latest starlink launch
