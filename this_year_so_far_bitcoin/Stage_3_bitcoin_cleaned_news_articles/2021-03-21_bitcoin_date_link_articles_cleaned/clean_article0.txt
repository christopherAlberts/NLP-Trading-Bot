miss this week’s the leadership brief this interview below was delivered to the inbox of leadership brief subscribers on sunday morning march  to receive weekly emails of conversations with the world’s top ceos and business decisionmakers click heremichael saylor’s transformation into a corporate bitcoin evangelical started prosaically enough he’s the ceo of a publicly traded enterprisesoftware firm microstrategy inc and with  million in  revenues and business steady but expenses down because of covid last year cash reserves started piling up like many in the bitcoinverse saylor has a profound unease about central banks propping up economies with cheap money by his calculations the increase in the monetary supply devalues the dollar by  a year he refers to cash as “trash” and a “melting ice cube” bitcoin on the other hand is “digital gold” in august saylor took the unorthodox step of moving a portion of his company’s treasury reserves into bitcoin buying  bitcoins for  million microstrategy continued buying and in february it added  bitcoins for  billion bringing its total holdings to  bitcoins current value  billion the company’s stock has soared in response closing on march  at  per share up from  a year agobut it was a casual twitter exchange that solidified saylor’s position as a cryptoguru cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are digital decentralized forms of money in december elon musk tweeted a slightly risqué image of a franciscan monk eyes cast heavenward hands clasped in prayer trying to resist the sultry allure of bitcoin saylor replied to musk that he should do tesla shareholders “a  billion favor” and convert tesla’s balance sheet from dollars to bitcoin musk responded “are such large transactions even possible” to which saylor replied “yes i have purchased over  billion in btc in past months  would be happy to share my playbook with you offline – from one rocket scientist to another” saylor  has dual degrees in aeronautics and astronautics from miton feb  musk’s tesla disclosed that it had bought  billion worth of bitcoin using cash on its balance sheet and said it would begin accepting digital coins as payment for its productssaylor joined time on march  for a video conversation about his efforts to persuade large corporations to add bitcoin to their financial toolboxesthis interview is edited and condensed for clarityinquiring minds demand to know did you speak directly to musk beyond your twitter exchange in decemberas a publiccompany ceo i can’t comment on any conversation i would have with another publiccompany officer it’s against business etiquettedo you think that twitter exchange had an impact on tesla’s decisionyesand are you in ongoing contact with said ceoi said i can’t really comment on a conversation i would have with a publiccompany officerwhy not the sec does not prohibit such disclosuresit’s not appropriate business decorum tesla’s such a maverick company are we seeing other indications that institutional investors are getting more involved in the crypto crazeif you go back to march  it was only the rare institution involved in the  months that followed there’s been an avalanche of institutional involvement microstrategy is the first publicly traded company that made a material investment but square followed and tesla followed but they’re the tip of the iceberg we did a “bitcoin for corporations” summit in february i thought it would be a couple of thousand people showing up it ended up being more than  a day and it broke our video serverwhat was the impact of the move by teslait was an inflection point all of a sudden the narrative goes from “those crazy people what are they thinking speculating in bitcoin” to “maybe this is a real thing this is probably not going away let’s try to figure out how to think about it”i’m going to read nobel prize winner robert shiller’s quote about irrational exuberance “irrational exuberance is the psychological basis of a speculative bubble i define a speculative bubble as a situation in which news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person and in the process amplifies stories that might justify the price increase and brings in a larger and larger class of investors who despite doubts about the real value of the investment are drawn to it partly through envy of others’ successes and partly through a gambler’s excitement” is bitcoin not a textbook example of irrational exuberanceno it’s the opposite it’s a textbook example of a rational action in response to monetary inflation can we agree that the money supply is expanding in an unprecedented fashion the past  months everywhere in the world if you’re going to make a rational investment decision today whether you’re a real estate investor a stock investor a bond investor or just a wage earner or you’re a treasurer you have to estimate the rate of monetary expansion for the next eight years we know there’s a commitment to run deficits and we know this commitment to stimulusso now the issue is what’s a rational behavior i’ve got to find a store of value if you’re looking for an example of real speculation it would be people speculating upon whether they can squeeze others in a short squeeze and a small stock like gamestop bitcoin is not speculation ok bitcoin is a unique new technology it’s like the facebook of money or the google of money and it grew from nothing to a trillion dollars in monetary value in  yearssubscribe to the leadership brief by clicking herebitcoin is a unique new technology its like the facebook of money or the google of money  michael saylor ceo of microstrategyfor people who aren’t early adapters why is there a whiff of something vaguely unsavory about bitcoin some of these remarks go back a few years and have since been revised but warren buffett called it “rat poison squared” jamie dimon a “fraud” and larry fink of blackrock said it was “an index of money laundering”i just think it’s a paradigm shift so you can’t blame smart people they’re all smart and they were all successful but if you go back and you look at electricity not every smart successful person immediately understood the implications of electricity in the first  months after they heard of it  thomas kuhn said when you come up with a new paradigm a completely utterly revolutionary way to see the world the establishment doesn’t normally accept it and you need a new generation to accept that unless there’s a war unless you have an extreme experience that forces you to embrace a new ideait’s a little early to talk about history but what so far is your legacywe are the first public company to actually adopt bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset to legitimize the asset class as an institutionalgrade safehaven assetand your missionmy mission right now is to fix the balance sheets of the worldsubscribe to the leadership brief by
