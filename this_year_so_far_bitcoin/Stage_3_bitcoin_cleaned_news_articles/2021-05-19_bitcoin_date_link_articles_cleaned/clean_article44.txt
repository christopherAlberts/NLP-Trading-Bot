meltem demirors coinshares chief strategy officer joins the yahoo finance live panel to discuss the crypto plungevideo transcript welcome back to yahoo finance live weve been watching a brutal selloff hit the crypto space here with bitcoin off close to about  overall in the last  hours we saw nearly a half a trillion dollars market cap wiped offthe board here as those moves accelerated that we have it seems like at least established a little bit of a bottoming out right now in the mid  mid  level for more on the moves that we are seeing play out in the crypto space i want to bring on chief strategy offer chief strategy officer digital asset investing company coin shares meltem demirors joins us right nowmeltem thanks for taking the time here because this is a very interesting point i think in the cycle weve seen it played out in bitcoin specifically i guess i mean it seemed like were going to bounce off the  moving average it was around that  price rangei mean what do you make of the acceleration of the selloff cause weve been seeing it play out over the last couple of days but what do you make of this and are we maybe seeing a bottoming out now yeah great questions look first and foremost today the last  hours have been crazy this is year seven for me in this industry so were accustomed to this but each time it happens obviously it feels very very rawlook weve seen some selloffs i think it really started last week with some skittishness in macro markets were seeing a lot of skittishness around whats happening with continued stimulus weve seen that in tech equities as well as core equities and also in cryptoany time theres skittishness in macro markets there happens to be sort of a knockon effect in crypto and lets be really honest weve had about  days of up and to the right momentum and bitcoin eth is up over  since the start of the year so were used to seeing  to  corrections in the crypto spacestory continuesand over the last week weve had a flurry of negative news theres these lingering esg concerns elon musks trolling of the crypto community potential investigations into finance and tether nervousness around new regulation and also options markets did flip bearish last week so the skew has been trending negativeso again there are a lot of different trends playing out here but when we have this type of environment we tend to see selling gets exacerbated and then on top of that all of the venues over the last  hours have been experiencing outages eth network congestion is at alltime highsso when we take all of these factors together you sort of get prime market conditions for a selloff thats been further exacerbated by people taking risk off now we see aggressive buying of the dip a lot of rebounding here but itll be interesting to see how the next  to  hours play out how how do we look at that macro correlation because meltem some of the headlines you pointed to whether its the musk tweets teslas moves i mean so much of that is what we focus on at least in the crypto space weve already been seeing the broader equity markets pushing lower as a result of inflation jitters but the tie the two for me on why specifically today the selloff is accelerated especially in the spacemeltem demirors absolutely so it really started over the last week we saw selling of bitcoin over the weekend bitcoin continued to declinethe biggest issue we see and theres great data from a firm called glass  a lot of the selling recently has actually been from recent acquirers of bitcoin when we look at onchain analytics we can see that longer term holders of bitcoin havent been selling theyve actually been using the selloff to accumulateits really the  of bitcoin holders that are now holding at a loss because they bought over the recent three months that have been driving the majority selling activity the selloff more importantly has been mostly retaildriven via platforms like binance coinbase has seen net sustained outflows of bitcoinwe have seen we have  billion in etps in the market we have seen for the first time over  million of net outflows from bitcoin etp products in the last week the gdtc product which trades in the us is now trading at a negative premium to nav or discount to nav i should say and that discount has only widened over the last few weeksand again what we tend to see is theres a lot of risk behavior where people get skittish theres a lot of fear uncertainty and doubt especially some of the newer entrants into the space who arent accustomed to the volatility want to take some risk off the tablethe last data point ill just mention is we are nearing alltime highs for the amount of institutional dry powders sitting on the sidelines institutions have been net sellers of risk over the last quarter whereas retail has been buying and thats more broadly from a macro perspective so i think were still seeing a lot of skittishness around risk in the current market yeah thats an important point to hit on because when we talk about institutional that element of this it was supposed to be that we werent going to see another collapse like this or maybe not to the size that were seeing now because the theory was oh institutional players arent necessarily going to be as skittish as retail players but when you look at the relative flows it was interesting to see bitcoin flows as youre talking about going the opposite direction and money coming out jp morgan showed the same thingbut when you look at ethereum fund flows not negative actually positive still so you got to wonder about maybe the room that that has to run whats your take on maybe how bitcoin dominance was already way down ahead of this selloff too which some people point to as a trigger what does it look like in the next couple of months here relative to all coins and bitcoin do you agree that it seems like ethereum has a lot more room to runmeltem demirors but look i think generally in every bitcoin cycle right in every crypto cycle if you will what we tend to see is as bitcoin runs bitcoin is up  since the beginning of this year right so bitcoin went from  to  ether just went through  runup as wellwhat we tend to see is when people make money in crypto markets they tend to rotate from the established large cap assets like bitcoin and ether into some of the longer tail higher risk assets as they chase the risk reward ratios so as people move further out on the risk reward spectrum what we see is not net new cash inflows going into some of those long tail assets but a lot of that activity happening through rotationi think thats what we saw now is a large thematic rotation from some of the larger better known assets ie bitcoin in some of the longer tail furthermore on the institutional side we have certainly seen an increase of interest from institutions and larger buyers in ether this i think is a great development for the crypto space and might actually lead to a reduced correlation between crypto assets overallhistorically crypto markets have had a beta of  to bitcoin but as we start to see this market grow as of last week  trillion market it really is an established asset class what were looking for at coinshares is some of that divergence starting to emerge where individual crypto assets are developing their own audience their own narrativeand this in my view is a good thing but we do expect bitcoin dominance to return at the end of the day whenever theres a big selloff like this we do see a lot of investors rotating back into bitcoin in particular as an asset theyd like to hold longterm and of course tax implications with a biden administration people are really looking for position that they can take where they can be net long for at least  months if not longer so i think that gives bitcoin some additional headwind particularly as we see buying on these dips meltem you and i are on the same page here and its nice to have someone to agree with on the show appreciate you coming on hope to have you back to chat that one further when theres a less craziness going on but meltem demirors coinshares chief strategy officer appreciate your time
