thousands of cryptocurrencies that have since been created its rise in value and popularity has been steady if not without its ups and downsbitcoin’s price exceeded  in april  setting a new record and coinciding with cryptocurrency exchange coinbase going public this high followed a meteoric rise in value in the early months of  after exceeding  for the first time in december here’s what you need to know about the world’s most wellknown and established cryptocurrencywhat is bitcoinbitcoin was created in  on the heels of the economic recession bitcoin was created to be an electronic peertopeer cash system but has also attracted cryptocurious investors as a storeofvalue currency comparable to goldhistory of bitcointhe concept of bitcoin was published in a white paper written by an anonymous figure under the pseudonym satoshi nakamoto in  no one knows the author’s true identity — or if it’s even a single person rather than a group of people the paper outlined how bitcoin would work and the currency officially launched on jan   according to ollie leech learn editor at coindesk a leading cryptocurrency news outlethow bitcoin worksbitcoin’s maximum supply is  million — and that’s all there ever will bewhen a cryptocurrency is released the creators can set its parameters how much there is rules for buying and selling how new bitcoins are added to the marketplace etc which cannot be changed after the fact locked in from the start these rules effectively make bitcoin a truly scarce resource with a ceiling on the total amount that will ever be available“no one not a government not satoshi themselves can change that now that it’s been released” says leech “you cannot duplicate bitcoins you cannot recreate them”that’s where the comparison to gold falls a little flat because gold is constantly entering the market as new ores and pockets are discovered making it only a relatively scarce resourcebitcoin is also much more transferable and more easily stored compared to a resource like gold if you want to move gold it’ll cost a lot of money armored transport security cost of storage in a secure facility etc bitcoin can essentially be stored on a usb stick — in something known as a cold or hard walletinvestment vs cashbitcoin was designed to be an electronic cash as its white paper explains but the currency’s volatility pretty much immediately scrapped this original intent according to leechfor example no person “in their right mind” would want to buy coffee with bitcoin says leech that’s because you could buy a coffee worth  today with bitcoin and tomorrow that same bitcoin is worth  and you’ve effectively spent  on a cup of coffeeor take it from the merchant’s point of view — you use bitcoin for your  coffee and tomorrow that bitcoin is worth  cents then the merchant lost out “the price volatility kind of makes it completely useless as an electronic cash system” says leechsimilar to gold people buy bitcoin “not because they expect to be able to go to the store and spend it but because they expect it to hold its value” says galen moore director of data and indexes at coindesk “for the same reason people would have diamonds or some  bills or some gold coins in a safe” they would keep a digital wallet with their bitcoin on itwhy is bitcoin so volatilecryptocurrency volatility is mostly due to the “immature market” says leech “traders are very susceptible to emotion and fear and greed and so you get these really extreme market reactions”there are also new regulations and policies that are constantly reshaping the market and causing drastic swings and then there’s social media“it’s this weird new thing where viral social trends like wall street bets or elon musk for example have a huge influence over crypto” says leech “if elon musk puts hashtag bitcoin in his twitter bio it sends bitcoin up ”while social media has a unique power to intrigue and excite its influence over the bitcoin market is also reason for casual investors to be cautious “please don’t invest in cryptocurrencies based on the trends on twitter” says kiana danial author of “cryptocurrency investing for dummies” and the personality behind the investdiva account on instagramwith so little historical context compared to more conventional investments bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should still be considered riskier assets danial says the potential reward comes with higher risk so make sure any investment in bitcoin is included in your broader portfolio’s riskier more aggressive allocationbitcoin miningwith bitcoin there is a finite supply of  million coins — though not all them were released when bitcoin launched in  about  million of  million bitcoin have been added to circulation since the “genesis block” the first block of bitcoin was mined by satoshi nakamoto says leechnew gold enters the market from mining as well — though with gold it is impossible to know exactly how much there remains to be discovered and minednew bitcoin is discovered and made available to buy and sell via a digital mining process which involves discovering new blocks’ unique hash a very long string of numbers and letters using an algorithm blocks are just groupings of transactions occurring within a given time frame and new blocks are constantly made availableeach block discovered via the mining process unlocks a set amount of bitcoin this reaps rewards for those who discover new blocks and makes new bitcoin available to buyers there’s no rhyme or reason to each block’s hash so miners set their computers to create many guesses per second to try and guess these random codesminers use powerful computers referred to as “nodes” to search for and discover new blocks anyone can be a bitcoin miner using free software available on bitcoinorg but running a computer like this consumes lots of storage space and energywhoever guesses the code first gets the right to create the next block — and pick up the transaction fees from it when its bitcoin gets bought and sold “each new block has a treasure chest and inside is a block reward which is free bitcoin that enters the market” says leechthis mining process is another factor contributing to bitcoin’s wild daytoday swingstoday about  bitcoin enter circulation every day through mining according to leech but there’s a cyclical trend called “halving” written into bitcoin’s original code every four years the amount of new bitcoin entering circulation every day gets halvedthe last halving was in  so in april or may of  the amount of bitcoin entering circulation each day will be reduced again the reduction will keep happening until the last bitcoin is mined which is predicted to happen in the year  says leechthis halving has happened three times since bitcoin was introduced with its adoption rising all the while so the effects of halving on the price of bitcoin are difficult to pinpoint the first halving in  led to a rise in the value of bitcoin while the second halving in  led to an initial drop before rising again the third halving in may  saw no drastic impacts to the price of bitcoin which has maintained record high prices since late with each halving comes more market fluctuation to the price of bitcoin “it’s deflationary by design” says leech
