beyond the incredible run in technology stocks and the headscratching success of meme stocks the appreciation of cryptocurrencies will be one of the signature stories when market historians look back on the pandemic with opinions polarized about the concept itself debating it doesnt often change mindsinstead lets take a look at bitcoin cryptobtc and ethereum cryptoeth the two most prominent digital assets to determine which is the better buy right now despite the similarities some key differences set one apartserving different purposesthe first thing to note when comparing bitcoin and ethereum is that they arent actually both cryptocurrencies at this point most people are familiar with bitcoin which was launched in  by the mysterious person or group called satoshi nakamoto its purpose was to make transactions anonymous and eliminate the need for a trusted third party to secure payments across a networkalthough ethereum is referred to as a cryptocurrency it is actually the network itself ether is the actual currency used to purchase goods and services on the ethereum network although the names are used interchangeably the difference is important the network lets users create their own applications and establish smart contracts that automatically enforce the terms more on that in a bitto the moonthe price of both bitcoin and ether have leaped over the past year up  and  respectively over the last month theyve gone in opposite directionsmost are familiar with elon musk and jack dorseys support of bitcoin but some wellknown figures like gweneth paltrow and snoop dogg are also longtime fans unfortunately celebrity endorsements arent always what they seem in  the securities exchange commission sec ruled that many promoting cryptocurrencies may be doing so illegally failing to disclose the fact they are being paid for it that mostly applied to obscure coins trying to gain traction but it does raise an important issueethereum lacks both the celebrity endorsements and the mysterious beginnings of bitcoin instead it has a relatively transparent history vitalik buterin was born in russia and raised in toronto in  at the age of  he was awarded the thiel fellowship named after peter thiel of paypal and palantir technologies fame the award goes to young people to enable them to pursue interests other than attending college a year later he cofounded what morphed into the ethereum network earlier this month he became the worlds youngest crypto billionaireimagining the futureaside from the hype and speculation there are legitimate reasons some decentralized digital currency could take hold in the future cryptocurrencies offer networks for transactions that could eliminate the friction of financial middlemen in the simplest example getting rid of brokerage fees and commissions in large transactions provides a strong incentive for an alternative payment systemfurther programmable contracts would also cut out layers of complexity and uncertainty imagine purchasing a ticket to an outdoor event that automatically issues a refund when weather data shows the event will be canceled of course ethereums vision is broader the ultimate goal is to create a decentralized internet running on many small computers around the globe rather than relying on third parties like microsoft and alphabets googleone problem with adoption of either asset is the price volatility although ether has outperformed recently historically it has had longer and steeper drawdowns when sentiment turns on the crypto marketalthough proponents often tout anonymity and security as features the truth is more complicated both currencies offer pseudonymity that means all transactions are stored on the blockchain with a crypto address of the transacting party not a name its similar to writing a book under a different name as long as no one knows who owns the address the transaction is in effect anonymous however if the owner of the address does become known the entire financial history of that person is available to everyone on the networkto avoid this risk the original bitcoin white paper suggests using a different address for every transaction as far as security the bitcoin protocol itself may be secure but the online wallets that store keys as well as various sites and services may offer no such protection there have been numerous breaches related to both bitcoin and ether in the past few years see here and herechoosing oneits hard to choose a potential replacement for governmentbacked currency but as with investing in biotech stocks or trying to cure cancer its probably best to diversify across a few that seem to have potential that said there are three characteristics that have me leaning toward ethereumthe first is the support of developers a recent report showed that in the third quarter of  an average of nearly  developers per month were working on ethereum that number was slightly less than  for bitcoin second the interest and promotion of celebrities makes it difficult to determine which incentives are really driving activity around the largest cryptocurrency in other words are people actually using bitcoin or are they just getting paid to talk about itfinally price appreciation although the recent drop in prices has affected all crypto assets this is clearly a market driven by speculation in such cases choosing the asset with the most momentum always seems like the better bet in this case thats ethereum
