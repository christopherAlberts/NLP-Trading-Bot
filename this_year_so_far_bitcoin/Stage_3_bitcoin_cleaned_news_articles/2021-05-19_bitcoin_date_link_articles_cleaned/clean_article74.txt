movement you will see these dips happening often” he said“what we are seeing has not happened for a long time where you have seen a dip of this magnitude in cryptos in the last  months there has been an upward trend for the whole crypto sector in general it is sort of unsettling for a lot of investors but the reason why most of the exchanges are under heavy load is the fact that there are a lot of new people coming in the next few days will give us a clearer picture but it seems there has been a lot of buying pressure as well as a lot of panic selling  or i would say profit booking – from those who entered bitcoin about a year ago if you look at it it is technically at least three to four times higher than the price one saw in  it is a combination of profit booking and panic selling” shetty told etnowavinash shekhar coceo of zebpay said the fall in bitcoin from its alltime high level may look dramatic but it is normal in many volatile asset including cryptos especially after such a huge rally“such corrections are mainly due to shortterm traders taking profits longterm value investors might call these lower prices a buying opportunity as microstrategy just did technical analysts would call this a test of the support level around  neither type of investors would say that tweets are the underlying cause use strategies like rupee cost averaging and sips to more confidently manoeuvre through volatility and take a longterm view” he saidnikhil kamath warned leveraged bets could cause big damage in such situations“when a platform offers leverage or funds the customers to buy for more than the money in the account the platform takes a credit risk with crypto exchanges offering  to  times leverage futures i wonder who monitors liquidity positions of these platforms on days like wednesday” he saiddrawing a comparison with the regulated space he said even with all the checks  balances brokerage firms once in a while go bust on days of extreme volatilityshetty said corrections like wednesdays can bring in some sort of sanity to the crypto market this dip will make the market more mature and it will ensure that people are aware there will be downtrends and uptrends in the sector and one needs to come to this with the longterm view rather than making a quick buck overall it is going to just make the industry stronger than probably the perception it had built over the past  months shetty said
