forgive me for not being a little more excited by bitcoins sudden collapse to  but come on its still double where it was last november when bill miller and stan druckenmiller essentially endorsed it you can read more about that hereplus it was a straight line up through  the whole crypto space had completely levitated from ether to dogecoin on snl to coinbase going public to companies like massmutual and tesla putting a portion of their cash into the asset class it wasnt ripe for a pullback it was overripewhy today before i give any specifics keep one maxim in mind the market always works to inflict the maximum pain on the maximum number of participants crypto collapsing certainly fits that bill right now as it seemed the whole world had gotten long but as to todays catalysts you can add china cracking down on banks doing any crypto transactions to tesla pulling the plug on taking bitcoin payments last weekthe deeper question is whether the fundamental cases for owning bitcoin have changed so lets review them supply and retail demand there are only going to be  million bitcoin so as bill miller said even if every millionaire on the planet there are  million of them wanted to own just one there wouldnt be enough that hasnt changed supply and institutional demand beyond the retail buyers there are two types of big owners that get bitcoin bulls excited professional money managers and corporate america both are only just starting to get the okay to invest in crypto assets like bitcoin which is what helped spark the runup in crypto starting last fall the player to watch here isnt tesla its massmutual the mavericky insurer which put  million into bitcoin late last year if they pulled the plug that would be a much bigger red flag but theres no sign of that happening makes you wonder if institutional money will actually jump at the chance to buy in here paying with bitcoin i actually dont think this is going to be a big usage case anyhow in the long runits just not cost or tax efficient and regulators might crack down teslas aboutface just seems to underscore that point as opposed to changing the stronger bull cases for crypto outlined in points one and two bitcoin to hedge the collapse the collapse of the dollar the markets the us government societyyou name it all of these might be reasons that buyers in categories one and two would want to own it but a glance at the price action today suggests that bitcoin isnt much of a hedge it tends to benefit from excess liquidity and suffer from a dearth of it like most other asset classes including stocks frankly i think most of the people who want to own a piece of bitcoin are doing so because they recognize everyone else isa classic landgrabso does the china news today change the fundamental cases for owning bitcoin as referenced in points one and two above i dont think so as goofy as this sounds to say the appeal of owning bitcoin will come down to how expensive bitcoin stays or as bill miller put it on our show it gets less risky the higher it goes as long as bitcoins price stays relatively high it will remain a mustown asset and it wont be if it doesntsee you at  pmkellytwitter kellycnbcinstagram realkellyevans
