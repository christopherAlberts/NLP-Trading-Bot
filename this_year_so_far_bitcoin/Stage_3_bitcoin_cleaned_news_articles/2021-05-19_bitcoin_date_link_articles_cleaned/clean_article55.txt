taproot now has more than the required minimum of miners signaling support to lock in the upgrade but the upgrade isn’t a shoein just yetper the activation rules set by speedy trial  of blocks mined within one of bitcoin’s difficulty periods need to signal support for the upgrade for it to be locked in for activation in novembercurrently mining pools that represent  of bitcoin’s hashrate have now included the taproot “signal bit” to show their support for the upgrade but it won’t be until the next difficulty period that we could see the upgrade locked in because the current difficulty period has already seen too many nonsignaling blocks for miners to hit the thresholda visualization of this periods signaling percentage taproot watchbitcoin’s next difficulty adjustment is in approximately nine days this next adjustment will mark the third of six possible signaling periods under taproot’s speedy trial activation process which began on may czechiabased slushpool was the first mining pool to signal for the upgrade followed by foundry  poolin and antpool notably mining pools have signaled unsignaled and resignaled for a variety of reasons so the signaling percentage can oscillate poolin’s signal for example dropped off in response to technical snafus while btccom’s recently changed its status from signaling to not signaling for unknown reasonswhat is bitcoins taproot upgradetaproot is bitcoin’s most anticipated upgrade since segwit the actual change an alteration to two lines of code is minimal but taproot will outfit bitcoin with a new signature scheme known as schnorr signaturesthese signatures pave the way for advanced transaction logic what the cool kids call “smart contracts” which will make things like multisignature transactions cheaper and more data efficient while also giving them a privacy boost by making them look the same as regular transactions on the blockchainin addition to multisignature wallets the upgrade will be a boon for the lightning network and other bitcoin technologies like discreet log contracts dlc
