in september  security developers working closely with bitcoin made an uncomfortable and public revelationa couple of years prior in  a bug within bitcoin’s blockchain was found if discovered by naughty evildoers the line of code could have brought the world’s most famous cryptocurrency crashing downknown as the inflation bug it would have allowed an attacker the capability to overload one or several of bitcoin’s blockchain nodes with a surge of fictitious transactionsa year before in  something also peculiar happened at facebook that left a few people uncomfortableengineers working on a project within facebook’s deep testing facility suddenly found themselves having to hit the kill switch their new adorable artificial intelligence ai creation — designed to communicate with itself in order to grow in behaviour and understanding— began to create its own languagethe incident was downplayed of course facebook had to deny that their new ai programme was attempting to hide or disguise its language from its human masters the pr department went on to confirm they had simply and offhandedly pulled the plug due to their ‘lack of interest’ in the eventthe rise of ai warfarewhile artificial intelligence is very much in early stages experts have predicted that future cyber warfare could eventually lead to ai fighting aithat is specifically — ‘good’ ai vs ‘evil’ aievil ai viruses will be made beyond the realms of humanmade firewalls and capabilities in order to attack valuable online targets therefore in order to combat this threat humans will be forced to create good ai to protect corporate interests and societal good again beyond the understanding of humansbut at least we know they’ll be on our side… i thinkso while we sit back and watch the terminators fight each other we may nervously wonder if bitcoin could withstand a future attack from skynet itself let’s explore…bitcoin vulnerabilitiesbitcoin’s blockchain is controlled by nodes which is the genius of bitcoin’s decentralised design made up of a anonymous collection of computers located around the world which number  total nodes these ‘miners’ are rewarded for recording and verifying each movement of bitcoin token on its blockchain ledgerthis system of selfgovernance or ‘proof of work’ pow concept is a protective measure against any likelyhood of one node trying to change a record or the ‘objective truth’ within bitcoin’s blockchain ledger since all other nodes the majority will disagree with itthe design of blockchain however once thought unhackable due to its decentralised nature has been subjected to successful cyberattacks one such attack was against the blockchain underpinning classic ethereum a cryptocurrency cousin of bitcointhe anonymous perpetrator finding a flaw within classic ethereum’s blockchain tricked the nodes in to believing they had a  majority control and proceeded to duplicate transactions in a tactic called ‘doublespend’ — that’s when the attacker by rewriting the ledger has the power to make the same cryptotransaction over and over out of thin airbeware of the jokerthankfully for many one of the best defences that bitcoin retains is its popularity and sheer volume of usage this makes it extremely more difficult to launch any  majority attemptin order to attack you’ll first need to rent enough computer power costing in the region of  per hour if you somehow manage that and take control of most of bitcoin’s nodes for a period of time the benefits of your attack will still need to outweigh the cost this is since your bitcoin key could be tracked down postattack and any coins in your possession removed by the very upset node majoritybut while security concerns remain focused on the ‘ attack’ potential the greatest threat to bitcoin may not come from someone or something who is simply trying to steal from itwhat is more likely is similar to what batman in christopher nolan’s portrayal of the dark knight comes to realise about his archrival the joker finely summarised by bruce wayne’s trusty confident and butler alfred“…some men aren’t looking for anything logical like money they can’t be bought bullied reasoned or negotiated with some men just want to watch the world burn”in other words stealing from bitcoin is hard destroying it may be easier and perhaps more funskynet’s arbitrary powerthe story of skynet depicted in the movie series ‘the terminator’ is a unique fascination humans have held for over  years since concerns about the rise of machines first appeared see the ’s play rurit’s true that within today’s realms that an evil ai probably does not exist at present to cause bitcoin any real threat that is because today’s ai is simply weak enough to be controlled or shut off as facebook didhowever as the likes of elon musk and stephen hawking have argued with ai becoming more powerful and influential in our everyday lives precautionary measures and steps need to be taken to prevent a future where arbitrary goals of ai could come to dominate everything elsein a simplistic terms take for example that in the future you setup an ai to help you source supplies and operate production equipment to make candlesyou build the ai with its core mission to lower costs and improve the way the candles are produced in order to maximise output however you happen to forget to programme in some important boundaries and human ethic considerations before starting offwith its one goal in mind your creation begins to self learn in order to acquire more resources and production equipment for candle making however it soon becomes uncontrollable in its procandle quest by taking resources and attacking anything or anyone in its way towards maximise candle production output including those trying to shut it downwhile this is a silly illustration the principle experts fear is the same rouge ai with a given arbitrary goal even seemingly innocent at first may stop at nothing including world domination to produce as many candles as possiblethis is significant consideration for any digital currency bitcoin crypto or otherwise that remains a dependent form of exchange for the future human raceit may not take long for us to discover if evil ai could indeed become smart enough to target bitcoin’s weakest points or find more undiscovered bugs — causing just enough disruption for users to lose faith and abandon trust in its decentralised exchangesome of you may call that ‘good’ ai
