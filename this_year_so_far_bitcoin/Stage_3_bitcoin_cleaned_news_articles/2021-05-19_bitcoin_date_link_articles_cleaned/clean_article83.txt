bitcoin is in a bear market let’s not beat about the bush or try to spin it the price is falling – it fell  just while i was asleep last night and it’s already almost  off its highs if it looks like a duck swims like a duck and quacks like a duck then it probably is a duck it’s a bear market so what happens next how long does it go on for where does it fall to and most importantly what do we do bitcoin is on the slide but what do you do about it bitcoin as we know is a highly speculative asset it is not only a new technology but a new technology that is money a more “bubbly” asset has never been designed it thus evokes all the emotions that come with a speculative mania in fact it heightens them to the “nth” degree massive fomo fear of missing out on the way up as well as elation exhilaration and delusionwhen it goes into a bear market the opposite happens with equal emotional intensity i don’t know what the opposite to fomo is – gmoott maybe get me out of this thing there will be denial hence all the arguing especially with elon musk fear capitulation and despair just as many lose perspective on the way up – “it’s going to a million dollars” – so will many lose perspective on the way down – “it’s finished bitcoin is over” lots of bad decisions are going to get made in fact many bad decisions have already been made – buying near the top now it’s about damage limitation do you sell now take a loss and buy back lower easy to say hard to do the particularly hard thing to do is the buying back lower bit bitcoin goes to  do you buy now “no i think it’s going to ” it goes to  at this point pessimism is so pronounced that it is very very difficult to persuade yourself to buy so you don’t then bitcoin reverses and before you know it it’s back above  and you’ve lost your position so do you “hodl” this is the tried and tested practice of holding no matter what it’s been the most effective bitcoin trading strategy since its inception  years ago perhaps it will be again who knows but hodling is very hard too it takes extraordinary will power to hold through two years of bear market how much further could bitcoin fall here are the key technical levels just before i went to bed last night bitcoin was sitting around  it fell  in the time i was asleep – that’s over shortly before shuteye i was posting on twitter that if  doesn’t hold then  comes into play technical analysis  says that’s the next line of support after  then  comes into play  is the old high from  – a monumental price point it would be very typical of bitcoin to come back to that level touch it and then resume normal business – to kiss  goodbye i’m not saying that will happen because i don’t know i’m just speculating and with words not money heck i wouldn’t rule out going all the way back to  but bitcoin could just as easily turn up and rally from here you know what it’s like the bull market was tired bear markets in bitcoin are normal they are as vicious as the bull markets are epic they are part of the territory and that is where we are now the financial times will be all over it so will the bbc and the economist there’ll be stories about lost fortunes many of the scams will be exposed there will be calls for greater government intervention and regulation but all the while the tech will evolve and improve i would say we have moved on from the “denial” phase and are now in the “fear” stage we still have “capitulation” and “despair” to go that is also when we reach peak gloating from “nocoiners” this bull market hasn’t been quite as epic as previous bitcoin bull markets so the corresponding bear market probably won’t see the usual  correction i think there have been five of these so far but a bear market is still a bear market
