myles udland brian sozzi and julie hyman discuss the falling pricing of bitcoin and the factors fueling its decline as volatility continues in the cryptocurrency marketvideo transcriptmyles udland but lets begin this morning with what we are seeing in the crypto space the moves are just enormous we see here on the yahoo finance heat map bitcoin right now off some  of course ether off some  we see cardano ada off some  doge you can see there is off about  ripple xrp off about  should note here yahoo finance uses a composite quote for these cryptocurrencies which brings in i believe its  different exchange quoted prices so this is a composite number likely to see pretty wide spreads across the crypto complex this morningbut julie i think whats so instructive for investors today is the question that is always asked as a theoretical does crypto would crypto matter to the broader financial markets in a time of stress like we are seeing this morning the answer is yes and i guess its not a huge surprise right given the  dollars the notional dollar amount that is assigned to these cryptocurrencies its not a huge surprise that when tens of billions of dollars in value disappear overnight we see some spread out into us financial marketsjulie hyman yeah i mean we keep hearing from the crypto bulls that part of their bull thesis lately has to do with their buzzword adoption right that we are seeing adoption on the part of companies were seeing adoption on the part of institutional investors and basically that means more people buying more cryptocurrencies so if that is indeed the case that more people are investing in it it makes sense that when it goes down you see a ripple effect through the marketmaybe people are selling elsewhere to meet margin calls that are related to their crypto assets maybe its just a general unease and taking profits through the market when they see a tumble of these kinds of magnitudes you know you do tend to see these cycles in cryptocurrencies and as more people are invested in these it stands to reason that it would become more painful when you see this type of magnitudestory continuesand to just get our arms around just how painful we were looking at some of the stats here that we got from various places bloomberg citing some numbers from coin gecko that the value of the crypto market has shrunk by more than  billion in the past week alone earlier in april just a few weeks ago we had seen the value of cryptocurrencies exceed  trillion whats also notable by the way the tokens tracked by coin gecko number  now most of them are not very large brian sozzi but it speaks to the enthusiasm in this market that new tokens are popping up all of the time and that someone out there is buying thembrian sozzi someone somewhere julie and myles but i think its very important to break down what is triggering the selling you have a lot of folks that have traded crypto for a year or have just gotten into it recently and theyre getting absolutely clobbered here on this selloff and a good note out this morning from the folks at jpmorgan theyre usually always tracking the moves in crypto theyre saying theyre seeing a lot of institutional selling so big investors are now selling into the selling pressure we are in fact seeingso what are those institutional investors doing with those gains or that raised capital jp morgan noting those institutional investors are now rotating from crypto into gold rotating into gold likely because of inflation fears and im just looking at the move here on gold guys gold prices over the past  days up  which is interesting compared to what youre seeing in crypto which is getting absolutely battered heremyles udland yeah i mean i think the other thing to remember at this point in the selloff is that you are going to we are going to were already seeing from the crypto evangelists commentary to the effect of crypto is a highly volatile asset there will be many cycles like this and we are always prepared for the price of bitcoin ether or any other major coin to fall in excess of  you know the note from the team over at bespoke looking at drawdowns for bitcoin over time the average decline from a high over the last  years has been  right now were off about  from our highs so were going to hear that commentary but that doesnt make it any easier and that doesnt make it any more funand sozzi as you mentioned there are always i mean this is in coinbases documents as they came public there have been over time more people getting into cryptocurrency during these bull waves which everyone in the space agrees are a feature not a bug of the market a feature of the market is that we have these mega price cycles up and they come down but if more people come in with each subsequent up wave there are many people who thus feel more direct pain on the way down than did in the prior cycleso again there is likely more folks more underwater depending on how far this goes than there were in  and  and i think that has a different psychological effect on investors as well and so i think again julie the maturation of the space makes each time different even though for a  market we hear a lot of comments that oh no no no weve seen this before its no big dealjulie hyman well and of course it depends were going to see varying exposure compared relative to who has that exposure right in other words will a large institutional investor have a better hedge for this than a small guy who was just trading in his robinhood account and trading on margin you know so i guess well have to wait and see if there are any sort of bigger blowups related to this latest leg down
