concerns about the impact of proofofwork pow and bitcoin btc mining on the environment are growing as interest in cryptocurrencies expands there is an increase in energy consumptionthe energy consumption of the bitcoin network made waves at the end of  even mainstream news outlets were reporting that it uses more electricity than the entire country of irelandat the time the network consumed an estimated consume over  terawatthours twh a year this is less than its current consumption of  twh according to digiconomistthe index explains that the yearly impact of bitcoin is  metric tons mt of  this is comparable to hong kong the coin’s  kt of ewaste is similar to that of luxembourghowever a  study speculates that they may be underestimated rather the researchers estimate bitcoin energy consumption accounts for “close to half of the current global data center electricity use”in china researchers found that mining could even threaten carbon emission reduction targetsthe environmental impact of mining hardwarein addition to the consumption of electricity mining hardware is a contributor to the global ewaste problembitcoin mining began using simple gpu and cpus as the need for power grew producers began creating unique chipsnow bulk mining uses applicationspecific integrated circuits asics they are specifically for mining cryptocurrencies on the pow algorithmcryptocurrency mining is a highly competitive space only the most efficient machines operate at a profit mining asics are being constantly improved as a result each new generation introduced to the market means older machines become unprofitablethe set number of coins and blocks motivates this constant improvement as more efficient machines join the blockchain the total hashrate of the blockchain also increasesthe quantity of bitcoins that any given miner obtains is largely dependent on the portion of the hashrate generated this makes older machines generate less profit while still consuming the same amount of powerstory continuesas a consequence bitcoin miners buy an incredible quantity of computing devices which they cannot repurpose after they lose their edgerenewable energy usage in miningas explained crypto mining consumes a lot of energy this is because bitcoin mining computers need electricity to runwhile this could have been a handful of miners at one point the mining industry has grown with warehouses filled with machines constantly workingas a result if this system ran solely on electricity fuelled by fossil fuels it would be clear that it is detrimental to our diminishing resourceshowever exactly how much mining uses oldschool electricity sources or renewable energy is up for debatea  mining whitepaper by crypto research firm coinshares found that  of bitcoin mining is powered by renewable energy this is their conservative estimatethis is forwardthinking energy consumption is reflected in some mining operations bitriver a colocation service for bitcoin mining in russia and the cis countries confirms that its plant only uses renewable energy“we use only renewable energy for our entire operation which is currently utilizing over  of power to mine crypto as the demand from new and existing customers continues to increase we are expanding our facility to utilize more of the total capacity of  that our site has” bitriver coo dmitrii ushakov tells beincryptosmall solutions for big problemsin addition to using renewable energy some firms are attempting to lower the environmental cost of their operationsushakov explains that his firm tries to help customers redistribute their hardware rather than throw it out they help them sell the rigs on the resale often those interested are miners who have access to cheaper electricity so they can still run a profit“at the moment there is huge equipment demand from mining farms who get electricity at a very low rate depending on your electricity cost which for some areas might be close to free operating older secondhand mining machines is advantageous costwise and after that the equipment can be recycled like any other computer parts fans are reusable and the housing could be repurposed” a representative from blockchain hardware and software firm bitmain explainshowever this resale and recycle stance only postpones creating a great quantity of ewaste rather than providing an actual solution to the problemredistributing waste byproductsanother way bitcoin miners are trying to offset their energy consumption is by using wasteful byproducts partnering with other industries to use these resources to run their mining operationsbitcoin mining produces a lot of heat according to the representative from bitmain the company uses this heat to keep rooms in their buildings normal in colder regionsin another example other miners are partnering with energy companies to utilize byproducts to run their operations in  crusoe energy solutions entered a deal with energy company equinor to use the excess natural gas from its north dakota oil field to mine bitcointhis gives equinor an incentive not to simply flare the gas which is harmful for the environment and channel it into useful productionbut are renewables enoughwhile the answer to bitcoin’s energy problem seems like renewable energy some believe it may not be enougha pwc blockchain specialist alex de vries outlines in his  report on bitcoin’s sustainability that even apparently “green” mining operations still contribute to environmental harmhe explains that often renewable resources such as hydropower are seasonal and so cannot produce the yearround energy required by miners“unlike the power demand of bitcoin mining machines which is consistent all year long the production of hydropower is subject to seasonality as a result seasonal variability in hydropower is already higher than  and expected to increase further because of climate change” he says in the reportas a result the need to mitigate these issues and continue mining sees a continued reliance on nonrenewable coal and nuclear poweris mining worth it it’s a question of balanceit is hard to determine the extent of the damage crypto mining has on the environment however this doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be a concern of the crypto communitymany consider bitcoin to be the key to a future that safeguards rights to freedom of speech financial freedom and a democratized technologywhile it is a contributing to energy consumption it is often called out among multiple industries that contribute the same or even moregerry mcgovern speaks about the masses of data currently consuming energy through wasteful storage in his  book world wide wastegiving examples of how many trees we would need to plant to offset data transactions according to mcgovern statistics show that it would take  billion trees to offset the pollution caused by email spamin addition  million trees to offset the pollution caused by the estimated  trillion yearly searches on googleenvironmental impact is not just a bitcoin thing it is a technology thing the way we are building our technological future is unsustainable and all industries involved need to start addressing
