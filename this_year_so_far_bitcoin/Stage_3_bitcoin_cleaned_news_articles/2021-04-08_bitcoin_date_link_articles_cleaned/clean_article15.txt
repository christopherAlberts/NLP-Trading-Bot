they have major impact on your reputation cause players to abandon and take a big bite from your bottom line join dean takahashi and others to learn how to defend your game against cheaters and pirateselevate your enterprise data technology and strategy at transform cryptocurrency is so hot it might melt the polar ice caps but a new group dubbed the crypto climate accord is debuting today as a way to address how the industry deals with token mining’s negative effects on the environmentthe group is a private sector initiative aimed at making the cryptocurrency industry’s energy consumption  renewable by  the group is a partnership of energy web rmi and the alliance for innovative regulation air the group brings together parties such as coinshares consensys web  ripple and the united nations who want sustainable blockchain and crypto technology it’s getting support from the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc climate champions“it’s about being efficient with energy and making sure that the energy consumed is actually green” said walter kok the ceo of the nonprofit energy web in an interview with venturebeat “what these computers do is execute a protocol to make sure that you can trust the outcome in a more decentralized way at the highest level if we can make sure that these services actually run on green energy then we have a solution our job is to prove the blockchain is running on green energy”with energy web utilities that actually produce green energy through wind turbines or through solar can show where they source that energy and how it gets usedhow big is the problembitcoin has gotten a bit of a bad reputation cambridge university estimated that the annual amount of electricity consumption for bitcoin is around as much as sweden produces in a year but not as much as all of the televisions in the us consume while operating on standby power“is it waste to keep your television on standby that’s a judgment” kok said “that’s why we invest in green energy production”kok said that offset investments can also be made in the meantime to make up for any nongreen energy usageenergy web itself is working on a decarbonized blockchain with xrp foundation and ripplesurging demand for crypto and accelerating adoption of blockchainbased solutions among businesses and individuals have highlighted a critical issue the impact of the technology’s growing energy consumption on the world’s climate as cryptocurrencies become increasingly mainstream it’s imperative to shift toward a renewable energy future nowthe aim is to create wins for both the planet and the global economy for climate advocates it can eliminate emissions from a fastgrowing source of electric load for the cleantech industry it can onboard an entirely new class of customers with significant demand for energy for the crypto industry it can help support the widespread adoption of crypto by making a more sustainable and scalable industryunspoken is the need for the crypto industry to also head off regulation energy web points out that electric cars will eventually pose a bigger challenge for green electrical energy consumption but that’s a bit like saying “regulators should go after that guy not me” for the most part energy web likes to stay out of those politicsstill energy web marketing director peter bronski said in an interview that bitcoin consumes about  terawatt hours of electricity annually by comparison china alone produced  terawatt hours of renewable electricity but of course the interest in bitcoin is growing and its market value has soared past  trillioncambridge university has been measuring the amount of energy consumed by bitcoin mining and other parties have been evaluating the carbon footprint of bitcoin as well as cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoinhow it will workimage credit energy webthe accord intends to achieve this by working with the cryptocurrency industry — including all blockchains — to transition to  renewable energy by  or sooner while many organizations are individually taking steps to decarbonize their operations the accord recognizes that an industrywide coalition and scalable solutions can quickly multiply impactthe accord will employ a “big tent” approach and act as a coordinating framework to decarbonize all aspects of the industry energy web air and rmi have developed three highlevel objectives for the accord to be finalized with supporters in advance of the united nations’ cop  climate conference later this yearthe goals include enabling all of the world’s blockchains to be powered by  renewables by the  unfccc cop conference developing an open source accounting standard for measuring emissions from the cryptocurrency industry and achieving netzero emissions for the entire crypto industry including all business operations beyond blockchains and retroactive emissions by energy web has a track record of sourcing renewable energy and building tools to decarbonize blockchains to help launch the accord energy web will bring to bear open source software and sector expertise to help crypto market participants take nearterm action and begin decarbonizing the industrycryptocurrency presents a unique problem it can’t be hacked or the digital currency could be gone in an instant to make it hackproof you need a large number of decentralized computers since it’s hard to hack every single computer the blockchain ledger is secure and transparent as each computer can be tapped as a source of truth to make the cryptocurrency secure it needs to have a big network as bitcoin and ethereum do more energyefficient networks can use fewer more trusted computers these use different schemes such as “proof of work” or “proof of authority” but then they can be hacked more easily and they are also more centralized and therefore vulnerablebut you can’t use so many computers that you use all of the world’s electricity especially for functions like mining which produces more coins for a party that controls computers and uses them to solve mathematical puzzles bitcoin already exceeds a  trillion market capitalization and it’s getting more popular“the question of whether things are wasteful is a judgment call” kok said “i think that the real solution is to convert all the electricity production to green that’s what we’re focusing on let’s accelerate the journey and as a sector let’s invest in that so that we whatever we use is provable as green”air will lead the engagement of key policymakers and regulators globally as the renewed focus on sustainability presents a clear opportunity to develop and implement pragmatic and effective energy sectorrelated policiesthe companies involved in the agreement
