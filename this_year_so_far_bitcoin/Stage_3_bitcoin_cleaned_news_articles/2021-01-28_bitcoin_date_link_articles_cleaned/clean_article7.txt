iran is trying to make crypto mining a source of income for the state while cracking down on minersiran hit hard by international sanctions lost revenue supplied by oil exports crypto might be a way to get some extra cash so iran has been toughening its grip on miners at home in an effort to better control this revenue stream since last year iran has also opened new opportunities for foreign mining firmsiran is a notable player on the bitcoin mining market and during  it contributed almost  of the global bitcoin hashpower according to research by the university of cambridgebut iran’s relationship with miners is best described as complicatedon the one hand iran clearly sees crypto mining as a way to generate income for the state iran began requiring miners to register with the country’s ministry of industry mines and trade and pay a higher tariff on electricity than retail or industrial users last yearbut iran has also blamed bitcoin miners for recent power outages just this month iranian authorities reportedly shut down  unregistered mining farms and confiscated  mining devicescoindesk takes a deep dive into iranian mininglights outin january iran experienced a number of power outages the authorities blamed the outages on bitcoin miners and went for a sweeping attack on miners big and smallziya sadr iranian bitcoin advocate and blogger insists that mining has nothing to do with outages and instead blames government mismanagement of the electricity grids “they shut down miners but we still have blackouts so guess what it’s nothing to do with the miners” sadr told coindeskto be sure the government has said miners only consume  of iran’s electricity according to the associated pressbut the iranian government has also claimed miners have made the country’s power grid “unstable” since  radio free europe reported the publication cited iran’s deputy energy minister who said some mining farms were based in “schools and mosques” that receive electricity for freeiranian journalist ehsan norouzi wrote in  that the list of entities running mining operations on free electricity might actually be much bigger the country’s elite armed forces the islamic revolutionary guard corps control a broad network of religious schools mosques and other entities that get electricity for freethere is no proof all of them are mining crypto norouzi told coindesk via a call but “if there is free electricity there will be a market for it” he said back in  iranians were sharing photos on social networks of at least one mining farm in a mosque the government asked the mullahs to declare fatwas against stealing electricitychinese investorsamong the victims of the latest blackoutrelated shutdowns is a mining company that recently opened a big farm in one of the country’s special economic zoneson jan  a couple days after a nationwide power outage iranian authorities temporarily shut down a mining farm in rafsanjan kerman province citing the excessive burden on the power grid the data center was certified by the authorities according to the local new outlet mehr news but was taken offline “in order to manage  consumption in the current situation”the farm is operated by the iran and china investment development group the organization’s website does not mention crypto mining only saying that iranian and chinese investors are building a joint  million terabyte datacenter in the rafsanjan special economic zone the idea that the chinese crypto miners were to blame for the blackout quickly spread on twitter prompting some antichina sentiment the diplomat reportedthe chinese investor is a company called rhy according to omid alavi head of vira miners and ziya sadr two iranian miners who wanted to stay anonymous also told coindesk that it was rhy’s farm that was shut downrhy boasts multiple mining sites including some in the middle east without specifying where on its website rhy posted a video titled “ mw mine” showing several hangars filled with asics a car briefly appearing in the video has a license plate with farsi lettering and a flag resembling the iranian oneaccording to the electricity bill translated by the diplomat the mining farm consumed a little short of  megawatt of power during one month bbc persian reported a similar capacity for the farm in rafsanjanrhy does not share the company’s contact information on its website and a customer service chat operator declined to connect coindesk to rhy management or a pr representative the operator also declined to discuss the firm’s iran business a request for comment sent via rhy’s facebook page went unansweredthe rafsanjan farm shut down because after iran introduced the new rules for miners the electricity tariff went up sharply alavi believes“the chinese came two years ago and they were looking for cheap electricity” alavi said “they found some place in kerman and started building a big farm at that time the iranian government didn’t have any regulation in crypto and they  used the industrial tariff after one year the government started regulation and changed the tariff so the company had to pay new bills”an iranian telegram channel dedicated to miners’ issues with authorities mentioned the story in a jan  post writing that “any foreign investor will run away after seeing the treatment of the chinese investor in rafsanjan”the channel also posted a letter of mohammad hassan ranjbar chairman of the board of directors of iranchina investment development group according to ranjbar the mining farm in rafsanjan had been paying  rials per kilowatt which is a high price“china is currently the only country that can invest in iran due to sanctions” ranjbar said in that statement also quoted by aljazeera “it is both rich and has technology so we can help each other to invest and build more projects but we can also send them away from iran and become completely isolated and alone in the world”foreign guestsrhy was

coindesk anonymouslybasir not his real name told coindesk he started mining seven years ago but three years ago the authorities took notice in may  police came to basir’s house he said telling him they suspect he owned an unlicensed gun then they saw the asics first the police thought the machines were “a spy server” but then the cyber police figured out what they were dealing withaccording to

life”last year the iranian government issued a directive that all mining facilities in iran must register with the government the owners must disclose their identities the size of their farms and what kinds of asics they are using the government has also raised the electricity tariff from  rials to  for kilowatt per hour in us dollars from  cent to  centsaccording to the ministry of energy there
