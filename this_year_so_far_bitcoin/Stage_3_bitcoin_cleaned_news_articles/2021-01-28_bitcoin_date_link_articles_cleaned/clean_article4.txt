january    min readopinions expressed by entrepreneur contributors are their ownbitcoin has seen incredible price movement these last few months it essentially came out of the bear market technical term for a market dominated by sellers around september that it had been in since the explosion of the previous bubble around january  since then bitcoin has been on an absolute tear registering gains that would make most fund managers’ careers this kind of growth has raised voices both in traditional finance and amongst the cryptosphere some are warning we might be in a dangerous bubble is there any truth to these claimsthe case for doubtersin less than a month bitcoin went from its previous alltime high of  to more than double assets do not generally double in a month especially not those that have been around for  years alreadymichael hartnett the chief investment strategist of bank of america warned that the entire cryptocurrency market might be in “the mother of all bubbles” since the beginning of  bitcoin has surged more than  according to hartnett this is a bigger and faster increase than famous bubbles such as the dotcom bubble of the late ’ or the housing prices before there is no denying that speculators have entered the fray and while bitcoin’s growth has been driven by the technological value of this system nothing can really explain that kind of price actionfortune also reminded investors that such a sharp increase in price was characteristic of bubbles and that quite often the price went back down even faster than it climbed the bubble in this case would be caused by overoptimism about innovations that might still have a big role to play in the future but are not worth what people are offering for it at the height of excitementrelated should you invest in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies experts share best practices in a volatile yet maturing marketthe case for believersthere are two big issues with calling bitcoin a bubble first there is the cyclical nature of bitcoin’s price a traditional bubble pops then disappears a bubble doesn’t just keep bubbling  and  have seen similar drastic price action on arguably a more impressive scalefor a bubble to exist a product has to be trading for vastly more than the value of the asset underneath this is much more difficult to determine obviously for something like bitcoin but we can certainly try what is bitcoin’s intrinsic valuebitcoin is a digital currency currencies have value if they can be used as a store of value if you can trust your money whether paper or digital to hold value against realworld assets then that currency has value this used to be insured by backing currencies with precious metals or even more directly in the case of coins that were made of metal worth the amount the coin represented the socalled gold standard has been abandoned though in the  century and now fiat currencies are backed mostly by the faith that individuals and groups have in it to store valueso bitcoin is not backed by a realworld asset such as gold but most currencies aren’t either in that case we can’t blame bitcoin for not having sufficient backing we have to turn to the qualities that make a currency valuable to see if bitcoin fits the bill and hold intrinsic valuethe first important determination is scarcity here bitcoin simply outclasses the competition ever since its inception there has been a limit number of bitcoin that will ever be mined  million there is no possibility whatsoever to increase that number and there is an ongoing debate over how much bitcoin has been lost forever but most estimates point to as much as  of the total supply being lost forever even though some feelgood stories do happen from time to timesecondly an asset must be a good medium of exchange this is also a domain bitcoin excels at since the fees to transfer sums of money of any size are quite competitive compared to the traditional banking sectorthird bitcoin has to have utility to be worth something while there was a time when very few accepted bitcoin as a mean of payment with the arrival of big players such as paypal and square you can now use your bitcoin to settle transactions with millions of shops around the worldbitcoin is also hard to steal impossible if stored properly due to blockchain technology it is also impossible to counterfeit or destroy bitcoins belong to their holders and while scams are still an important issue they are not exclusive to the cryptocurrency spacerelated the crypto market is now worth more than  trillion for the first time as bitcoin hits record above how much is one bitcoin worththe answer to whether bitcoin is in a bubble lies in how much one bitcoin is worth but not in dollars its intrinsic value is dependent on the characteristics that define any currency bitcoin might be unique its own category of currencies but that does not mean it cannot be judged by the same rules as every otheraccording to the characteristics we’ve listed bitcoin ticks all the boxes furthermore it does so better than all of its competitors if we consider currency to be a means of facilitating exchanges between individuals then bitcoin has several advantages compared to its competitorsof course the increase in price we’ve seen these last few weeks is unsustainable in the short term bitcoin will certainly see some pullbacks on a very short scale we might even say that bitcoin is in a bubble but if we zoom out bitcoin might just be one of the most undervalued assetshow can we then determine the true value of bitcoin there is no easy answer to this but one metric that has been criminally undervalued is general public adoption renowned analyst willy woo took to twitter on december   to write the following “the adoption curve of bitcoin is faster than any other global infrastructure rollout before it its growing faster than the rollout of the internet mobile phones and easily faster than virtual banking players like paypal”we are still very early in the life of bitcoin and if bitcoin continues to gather new users at this rate it should easily surpass its competitors in the financial sector which will certainly lead to an increase to its pricerelated why small businesses should consider bitcoin
