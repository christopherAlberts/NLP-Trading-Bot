a new paper argues that bitcoin can serve a valuable purpose in institutional portfolios in spite of its volatilityas institutions are increasingly considering incorporating cryptocurrency into their portfolios one question remains how do you allocate money to bitcoin without taking on too much risktraditional risk modeling strategies — like factor statistical or macroeconomic models — cannot be applied to bitcoin in the same way that they are applied to other asset classes according to new research from joel coverdale a risk consultant with hong kongbased consulting and advisory firm eight isle and exblackrock director“bitcoin as an emergent asset class poses a tricky dilemma in that it doesnt fit neatly into the existing modeling frameworks” according to coverdale’s paper “at least not at first glance”coverdale first modeled bitcoin’s returns on a weekly basis finding that since  bitcoin had largely volatile weekly returns that skewed slightly positive over time coverdale estimates that bitcoin’s volatility is about two or three times that of most other asset classes“people see this kind of volatility and think immediately that it has no place in an institutional investment framework” coverdale wrote “but as nassim taleb points out ‘volatile things are not necessarily risky and the reverse is also true’”coverdale argued that bitcoin’s lack of correlation to other asset classes makes the level of volatility less concerningusing estimations based on risk data and analytics firm axioma’s multiasset class risk engine coverdale looked at the correlation of bitcoin to other asset classes as of december  his estimates show that although bitcoin is slightly positively correlated to most asset classes that correlation never goes beyond  which is not the case for the other asset classes he measured“whilst the volatility is likely to increase the overall portfolio volatility when allocating capital to bitcoin due to the correlation effect the overall impact when accounting for correlation is much more muted” coverdale wrotephilippe bekhazi chief executive officer of xbto group a cryptocurrency finance firm agreed“what bitcoin provides is not a hedge to the other risk assets but instead diversification amongst other risk assets” bekhazi said via email thursdaywith this all in mind coverdale constructed sample portfolios that substituted bitcoin in for a percentage of equities a percentage of currency or as a replacement for currency altogetherhe found that replacing  percent of equities with bitcoin increased the portfolio’s overall risk by just  percent when he replaced currency with bitcoin instead the portfolio’s risk increased by around  percentxbto found the same when comparing major assets “this holds true irrespective of whether we are looking at daily returns for the last year or looking at monthly returns over the last ten years” bekhazi said via email“it’s an obvious point but one worth making clearly – at a  percent weight even if bitcoin were to go to zero the most it would impact our portfolio is  percent” coverdale wrote “the upside is unconstrained however”coverdale argued that because of this from a riskadjusted return perspective it doesn’t matter how one allocates to bitcoin but rather that they do it
