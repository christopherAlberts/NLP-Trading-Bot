bitcoin’s btc price was higher though staying in a range over the past week of between roughly  and “signs of market exhaustion from the bulls are becoming more prevalent” said lennard neo head of research for the cryptocurrencyfocused stack fundsand in what appears to be a crypto segue from the gamestop episode that has riveted global financial markets coindesk’s tanzeel akhtar reported thursday that prices for the digital token dogecoin doge more than doubled after the twitter account wsbchairman posted the following “a lot of you are talking about dogecoin what’s that a meme

of the biggest blockchain projects doesn’t really have any serious technologists or programmers backing it but it’s often symbolized by the face of a cute dog which has won praise from fans ranging from tesla ceo elon musk to the adultfilm star angela white it now has a market value of  billionin traditional markets european shares fell and us stocks wobbled gold weakened  to  an ouncemarket movesfor cryptocurrency traders and analysts one of the things that’s so surreal about the gamestop saga is that it all seems so familiarwhether illegal or perfectly legit so many of the hallmarks of the upstart trade bred in a socialmedia den as a way of challenging mighty wall street’s privileged position in finance bear more than a passing resemblance to the kind of activity that takes place daily in digital marketsnot that anyone in crypto’s really bragging – just saying the episode might serve as another example of how different markets might look and behave in a technologyenabled decentralized future where the balance of power isn’t so concentrated among the alwayswinnersin search of takeaways first mover reached out to the financial historian niall ferguson former morgan stanleybankerturnedcryptobanker caitlin long themysio ceo jonathan mohan and quantum economics founder mati greenspan here’s what they said the gamestop coterie isn’t the only crowd taking on big finance just like the retailtrading raiders in the reddit forum wall street bets who took on shortselling hedge funds with billions of dollars of capital the cryptocurrency industry was born as a way to fight back against concentration of power and wealth the bitcoin blockchain was invented as a peertopeer electronic payment system designed to be free from the influence or control or rentseeking tendency of banks “in the plague year a lot of people have started to experiment with investing in things they hadn’t really touched before” ferguson said in a zoom interview “the barbarians  the gates  years ago are the establishment now and there are new barbarians at the gates” percentage moves in the hundreds are something to expect even accept as reported wednesday by coindesk’s zack voell gamestop gme saw its stock price surge nearly  in five days that’s not unprecedented in digital markets sure bitcoin’s price quadrupled last year ether eth the native cryptocurrency of the ethereum blockchain rose fivefold but according to the website coinmarketcap there are at least  cryptocurrencies in existence many of which nobody has ever heard of and many of whose prices go up and down by ridiculous amounts nearly every day see table below the whole thing can sometimes resemble pinksheet markets where hardluck pennystock traders sometimes finds good luck but it’s also apparently what happens when entrepreneurs and speculators get together in a lightly policed market environment “there are certainly within the crypto markets a lot of scams and pump and dumps but you gotta take the bad with good” greenspan said in an audio interview over telegram “overall what we’re talking about is the democratization and freedom of financial markets”digital tokens whose prices have increased by multiples just over the past seven days editors note weve never heard of any of these source messari bookkeepingbyblockchain might be more efficient than wall street’s ledger systems according to the firm  partners some  of gamestop’s available shares were borrowed to “sell short” – meaning the traders sold the borrowed shares in a bet that the stock price would go down the idea is they’ll buy the shares back to repay the stock loan after the price falls long whose firm avanti won a specialpurpose banking charter in october from the state of wyoming says gamestop’s ratio shows some big investors might have sold shares that they hadn’t already borrowed a practice known as “naked shortselling” that is generally prohibited but loosely enforced it happens because of wall street’s impossibility of instantaneously coordinating multiple ledgers of who owns what and when with blockchain networks the information is always being synchronized “bitcoin really does fix this because bitcoin is an honest ledger” long said in a phone interview “the reason why the crypto market is so riled up about gamestop is because the crypto market has known about the inaccuracies in wall street’s bookkeeping for years this is just another in a long list of examples” many new investors appear to be in it not just for the money but the fun the entertainment the joke the thrill gamestop as a franchise is a sort of punchline not only are almost all games sold online but people certainly aren’t flocking to the stores these days even the brand looks worn “some people are saying that the fundamentals are broken and that they don’t understand what happened with gamestop and that it’s some kind of meme or a joke” mohan said in a phone interview “in cryptocurrency we call that dogecoin it’s a wellunderstood phenomenon sometimes retail investors can aggregate demand over a joke to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars that spirit and that essence is sort of bubbling out into the traditional equities market”– bradley keounwhats hotguggenheim cio minerd who has predicted a bitcoin price of  tells bloomberg tv the base of institutional buyers is “just not there” to
