london jan   prnewswire  bitcoin svs bsv scaling test network stn hit a new record this week processing over  transactions per second at one point on january  its previous record was  tps in december  despite being a testing network the stn shares most of its technical capabilities with the bsv mainnet—once again disproving the notion that bitcoin cant scale onchainto put that into perspective the btc network which many still incorrectly insist on referring to as bitcoin limits its block sizes to  permitting a maximum  transactions per second its more like  thats not seven thousand… but seven no blockchain asset has a hope of gaining use as a world currency global payment settlement layer or for everyday payments at such a low capacity and it can cost over  or even  to send a single btc transaction of any amounthow did the scaling test network achieve the new recordstn operations manager brad kristensen told coingeek that his team thinks over  tps is sustainable on the stn going by the data theyve collected just recently they observed an average of around  ktps or  tps over an eighthour period you can monitor stn statistics yourself at this sitewe have a few ideas on how to increase this further without code changes but will have to wait and see with some more testing kristensen saidwhat improvements have been made to the stn since the last record was set the network is now in its fourth iteration aka  running since november  and is on software version  the previous  ktps occurred on stn what improvements have been made to the stn since then to increase the capacity kristensen saidthe performance improvements in  played a big role here the care and dedication from the sv node team is second to none the improved handling of chained transactions appears to be paying dividends we still want to play around here a bit more with the recent increase to support chains of  by defaultwe have a lot of levels to test to find the optimum throughput assuming our only goal is chasing peak tps however the sustained rate is more important i think and where the real power of bitcoin is sustained tps over long periods is where we hope to see continued repeatable gains in the year ahead he addedbsv mainnet also has the capacitykristensen added that it was important to remember the bsv mainnet already has the capacity to handle similar transaction volumes but at present lacks the demand for it however the goal of the stn has always been to try and reflect the mainnet as close as possible just at larger scalewas there anything special about the transactions during the record peak time this week kristensen said it was due to a number of factorsthey are mostly standard transactions however recent testing has involved using increasing chain lengths starting at  then  moving to  and beyond… this means at chains of  if we generate a million utxos each of those million will have  children and so on we are also using the new rpc method further improved with  for handling bulk transactions a feature miners will no doubt make use of with clients they have direct agreements with and transactions that enter their networks through merchant apithe goal of the stn has always been to try and reflect mainnet as close as possible just at larger scale keeping that in mind mainnet already has this capacity all it lacks is the volumewith more big data projects coming online in  to test its limits with nanotransactions and the bitcoin sv node team is available to assist new projects looking to process large amounts of data on a blockchain that actually scales the challenge now kristensen said is to attract more enterprisetier usersthe stn is our proving ground we know mainnet could do it because the stn can its down to the miners to be ready to embrace bitcoin at enterprise scale when that volume arrives we hope that the stn not only can show it can be done but also offer guidance if needed to miners coming over from scale challenged chainssource bitcoin sv
