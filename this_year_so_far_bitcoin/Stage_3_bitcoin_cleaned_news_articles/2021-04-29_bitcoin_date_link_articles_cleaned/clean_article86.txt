on april   ripple labs inc ripple scored an important win in a discovery dispute in a us securities and exchange commissions sec enforcement action when sdny magistrate judge sarah netburn granted in large part ripples motion to compel sec  exch commn v ripple labs inc no  sdny ripple is a payments technology company that uses blockchain innovation including the cryptocurrency token xrp to send value around the world the sec sued ripple its ceo and its chairman alleging that xrp is a security and that ripple sold  billion xrp tokens since  without filing a registration statementjudge netburn directed the sec to comply with many of defendants discovery requests including those that called for the secs communications with third parties which included other government agencies about whether two other comparable cryptocurrenciesbitcoin and etherwere securities and whether xrp itself was a security judge netburn denied defendants request for wholly internal sec communicationsdefendants argued in their motion that sec communications concerning bitcoin ether and xrp potentially could show the secs own uncertainty around the regulation of cryptocurrencies a key premise of that argument was that the sec is a focal point in the ongoing marketwide discussion about the character of xrp and other digital assets therefore for purposes of ripple the secs views articulated to third parties would be relevant to defendants arguments about lack of fair notice that xrp could be considered a securityindividual defendants also argued that these communications could be relevant to their argument that they lacked scienter because ripple executives were charged with aiding and abetting ripples alleged violations of section  of the securities act of  the sec must show that the individual defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that ripple was engaged in a securities law violation and the executives nonetheless substantially assisted ripple in committing that violation sec  exch commn v apuzzo        cir   usc ยง  for this reason the individual defendants argued that the sec has put at issue whether xrp sales were securities offerings and whether individual defendants knowingly or recklessly failed to recognize them as suchin its response the sec framed its enforcement action against ripple as a straightforward application of the us supreme courts ruling in sec  exch commn v wj howey co  us   which set the standard for determining whether an asset is a security because the howey test looks at each asset on its own facts the sec argued that facts about other digital assets are irrelevant the sec took the position that the howey test generally puts market participants on notice of what assets may be considered securities such that any action or inaction by the sec would not properly support a defense of lack of fair noticejudge netburn ruled from the bench directing the sec to produce the discovery related to bitcoin and ether and communications between the sec and third parties including other government agencies relating to xrp from  sec custodians that defendants had identified these custodians included sec staff and three currentformer commissioners or chairs who were identified by their initials judge netburn denied the motion to compel as to internal sec communicationsjudge netburns ruling may be significant for defendants faced with these types of questions in the future first she accepted at least for the purposes of this motion defendants arguments as to the relevance of the secs views articulated to third partiesincluding other government agenciesabout bitcoin and ether she observed that such evidence could be relevant to the courts eventual analysis with respect to the howey factors because it goes to individual defendants understanding of their own conduct and to the fair notice defense that ripple is raising she appeared to be influenced by defendants arguments that to deny their motion at this stage would be tantamount to a merits determination second the court distinguished thirdparty communications from internal sec communications on multiple grounds the court reasoned that wholly internal sec communications are less relevant could seriously chill government deliberations and likely would raise extensive privilege issues the ruling therefore avoided thorny issues delineating the secs informationgathering and deliberation functions at least for nowripple continues to be a significant case both in the crypto space and as to sec regulation and enforcement more broadly of particular interest is how the reasoning underlying the courts decision may be used to compel discovery in ongoing and future enforcement actions particularly as the sec takes a more aggressive stance concerning accounting treatment for warrants and other issues related to special purpose acquisition vehicles spacs an area that has garnered attention due to recent statements by the secs director of corporation finance for more information about spacs and recent regulatory developments please see our recent advisory on this topicadditional developments are likely in coming weeks as the court considers whether to allow a group of xrp holders to intervene and the recent motion to dismiss filed by one of the individual defendants we will continue to monitor and post updates on other
