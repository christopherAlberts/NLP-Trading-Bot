let me answer the second question first we don’t buy now for a swing trade because we don’t chase moves where the rewardrisk is no longer attractive it is that simple if price continues higher from here it does so without us because we focus on risk and sometimes that means letting a trade go effective risk management is what leads to consistency not big winsas far as preparing for the next buying opportunity if bitcoin can retrace to the  to  area and produce a bullish reversal that would be a higher low risk can be clearly defined off of such a structure and we will be prompted to share a new swing trade long idea if the scenario materializesa more extreme bullish scenario would be a test of the  area a second time which would be a potential double bottom similar to gold off of  if a bullish reversal can materialize here it would be an even more attractive swing trade long idea in terms of rewardriskit is also possible that bitcoin gyrates within a very tight range around  for a few days while establishing a momentum continuation pattern to go higher in this situation we will be open to taking on a new swing trade long but it will be categorized as an aggressive trade since the location is less than ideal in this scenario at least there is a pattern to define risk fromi just presented the main criteria that price needs to meet before we consider assuming any new risk in other words we take positions based on rules not feelings opinions or reactions to information if bitcoin does not align with the rules whether it runs or not we do not put on any new risk rules promote consistencyif you would like to learn more about our analysis perspective and signal service visit here
