bitcoin may be the key piece in solving the growing demand for energy usage outpacing our ability to capture and store energy from the sunthe stage has been set for bitcoin to incentivize renewable energy and power a greener future tesla and elon musk have the technology and ingenuity to solve one of the greatest challenges facing humanity a dawn of optimism and hope is coming into focusin february  cathie wood ceo of ark invest interviewed elon musk on the ark investment podcast “fyi  for your innovation” elon said im not sure it would be a good use of teslas resources to get involved in crypto we are really just trying to accelerate the advance of sustainable energyi’m not sure it would be a good use of teslas resources to get involved in crypto we are really just trying to accelerate the advance of sustainable energy and i think actually one of the downsides of crypto is that computationally it is quite energy intensive so there has to be some kind of constraints on the creation of crypto but its very energy intensive to create the incremental bitcoin at this point  elon musk  fyi  for your innovation  feb  two years later tesla has since added  billion of bitcoin to its balance sheet and now accepts bitcoin as payment since then the company has been raked over the coals by environmentalists and critics who were triggered by the movetesla’s mission of accelerating the advance of sustainable energy has not changed almost no one has given even the slightest thought about how elon could use bitcoin to incentivize solarin recent weeks fortune bloomberg the new york times the independent the bbc forbes the financial times cbs the telegraph time and the guardian have all parroted the same antibitcoin narrative derived from selfdescribed “hobbyist” alex de vries who as it turns out works for the dutch central bankon earth day the bitcoin clean energy initiative bcei released a memorandum with square crypto and ark invest that caused further uproar elon publicly endorsed itand the antibitcoin media machine again went into actionthe details of the bcei memo itself went largely undiscussed which is a shame since it appears to give away tesla’s game plan it very clearly describes using bitcoin solar and batteries to overgrow solar energy and solve the problem of the duck curvethe duck curve coined by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel is the greatest challenge facing solar energy at scale watch david roberts’s excellent  video the duck curve is solar energys greatest challenge and youll quickly grasp the issue to summarize his videopower companies supply the least amount of power overnight then ramp up in the morning then at sunset energy demand skyrockets as more people adopt solar energy it causes problems in this demand curve the sun produces the most energy at midday every year adds new solar capacity which makes midday demand belly lower and lower researchers call this drop in demand the duck curve the belly of the curve grows deeper every yearfrom the regional grid managers perspective it looks like a drop in demand its neither cost effective nor possible to transmit all the excess solar energy into the grid much of it is stranded or curtailed it is an overabundance of energy that today has to be wastedas the sun sets solar production ends right as the demand for energy typically peaks power plants then have to quickly ramp up production to compensate for that which is challenging with today’s power infrastructurethe second problem is economic say you have a couple of nuclear and coal plants those plants are only economic when they are running all the time basically they run around the clock and if you have to turn them off at midday it completely screws up their economics and plus lots of utilities just have contracts with those power plants to keep them running all the time so that creates sort of an artificial floor if solar generates too much power and theres no use for it theres no one to consume it then grid managers just have to turn some solar panels off  david roberts  the duck curve is solar energys greatest challenge  voxif the excess solar power wasnt curtailed the power grids are at risk of being overloaded or even damagedso we throw away some of that extra solar energy effectively whats happening is that solar power is being wasted that waste curtailment is the big challenge moving forward for solar energy if you want solar to eventually power everything or close to everything weve got to figure out some way of shifting it to the night timethe duck curve cannot be solved with current infrastructure and storage this makes solar adoption less appealing and less profitable but also wasteful if tesla cannot figure out how to solve this problem the technology wont scale and adoption will stagnatehow does this relate to bitcoin tesla recently announced tesla solar panels and solar roof will only be sold as an integrated product with tesla’s powerwall battery their powerall system cannot be purchased without also purchasing tesla solarthis would make tesla solar configurations very poor investments a home with a  electric bill would require  upfront for just the panels and not breakeven for  years after  years one would save  were it not for the  powerwallso after  years you would save roughly  those economics don’t add up there is no monetary incentive for homeowners to invest in solarhowever this creates an integrated solar product that can link to the power grid and tesla devices powerwall will sit behind the meter and have the ability to intelligently store excess energy or put it to good usetesla now makes its own custom asics for example their full self driving fsd asic powerwalls could ship with tesla asics that instantly and intelligently switch between pooled bitcoin mining or selling back to the grid when demand increases and it becomes more profitable to sell energy than mining in other words tesla could create a massive green mining pool to consume the solar duck belly and turn it into bitcoin here are two examples of innovative homeowners with diy versions of this conceptthe bcei memo was all about using a combination of solar batteries and bitcoin to solve the duck curve tesla just happens to have all of these in its bag already all they need is a way to intelligently pool that power into hash whenever it makes the most sense and solve the technical hurdles of taming asic heat and noise if anyone can figure that out it will be elon and teslaa unique energy buyer  bitcoin miners are unique energy buyers in that they offer highly flexible and easily interruptible load provide payout in a globally liquid cryptocurrency and are completely location agnostic requiring only an internet connection these combined qualities constitute an extraordinary asset an energy buyer of last resort that can be turned on or off at a moment’s notice anywhere in the world  bitcoin is key to an abundant clean energy future  bitcoin clean energy initiative memorandum  april bitcoin miners are unique energy buyers in that they offer highly flexible and easily interruptible load provide payout in a globally liquid cryptocurrency and are completely location agnostic requiring only an internet connection these combined qualities constitute an extraordinary asset an energy buyer of last resort that can be turned on or off at a moment’s notice anywhere in the worldthe memo also formally introduces ark’s solar  battery  bitcoin mining model and it links to their blog post which says these combined systems should work at all scales and could create interesting opportunities at the residential level”we believe these threepart energy systems should work at all scales and could create interesting opportunities at the residential level particularly if heat waste from bitcoin mining can be put to use in other applications  solar  battery  bitcoin mining  ark invest  april it would appear that ark is opensourcing their model to get constructive feedback before it is considered by tesla for residential use at scale it is worth pointing out that the model assumes the solar bitcoin miners will put profits into satisfying the needs of the grid over maximizing profits of the minernot only does the bcei memo spell out how bitcoin works in this strategy it also links to this brilliant article by max webster which artfully explains virtual power plants and miner amortizationtesla could pay customers for sacrificing their duck bellies in whatever currency they wanted bitcoin fiat shitcoins or stablecoins the customers would earn money and tesla would stack the mining rewards in their bitcoin treasury smart customers would demand payment in bitcoinso imagine you have a bitcoin powerwall it learns your energy habits and intelligently spends the excess energy on either hashing or selling back to the grid whichever is more profitable although tesla has an obvious advantage in this area this strategy is something other device makers could employ if they partnered with solar companiespeople might argue that the excess power was better spent on scientific computations and perhaps a market could be made for these other computations but with all that distributed computing power it would drive the cost of all those other competing computations to zero see michael saylor’s explanation of what happens when something becomes commoditized and gets oversupplied by technological advancements like dematerialization bitcoin is uniquely immune to this thanks to the difficulty adjustmentonly bitcoins closed thermodynamics offers the ability to absorb all that excess energy like a black hole without driving the cost of the computations to zero no other asset on the planet can do that bitcoin is the energy buyer of last resortonly a neutral proofofwork asset like bitcoin—free of the taint from premine or fallible figureheads—has the ability to eat unlimited amounts of curtailed solar energy for breakfast proof of stake is anorexic when it comes to eating energylisten to michael saylor explain how bitcoin acts as a thermodynamic closedloop battery for energythis is the first truly engineered monetary network in the history of the world and by that i mean its a closed thermodynamically sound monetary system if you put a hundred million dollars in the system its like charging a battery it has no power loss you can store it for a hundred years itll still be there every other monetary system has a power loss in it it bleeds energy if you put your money into electricity and store it in a battery you lose two percent a month you have  inflation rate a year you cant move electricity around without losing six percent of it over the course of a few hundred miles so what if i wanted to store all my monetary energy and i didnt want to lose it every month or every year or every decade well id design a closed system  million gold coins none come in none go out all i can do is heat it up or cool it down thats the definition of a thermodynamic closed systembitcoin is the first example of that system what that means is that you can collect all of the monetary energy in the world store it in this battery hold it for a hundred years channel it through time and space with no energy loss its an engineering breakthrough it’s like an aqueduct its like an electrical power system or grid —michael saylor  should tesla convert its cash to bitcoin  hyperchange  dec  in the problem of increasing human energy nikola tesla described how humanity must use more energy to increase the force accelerating human progress ideally by harnessing the sun amazingly he foresaw the problem of the duck curve and how it would largely be impractical and go wasted without some way to efficiently harness its periodic energymotive power means work to increase the force accelerating human movement means therefore to perform more workwhence comes all the motive powerall this energy emanates from one single center one single source—the sunthe sun is the spring that drives all the sun maintains all human life and supplies all human energynotwithstanding the apparently vast amount of energy received from the sun’s rays only a small fraction of that energy could be actually utilized in this manner furthermore the energy supplied through the sun’s radiations is periodical and the same limitations as in the use of the windmill i found to exist here also after a long study of this mode of obtaining motive power from the sun taking into account the necessarily large bulk of the boiler the low efficiency of the heatengine the additional cost of storing the energy and other drawbacks i came to the conclusion that the “solar engine” a few instances excepted could not be industrially exploited with success  nikola tesla  the problem of increasing human energy  the century magazine  june bitcoin might just be the missing ingredient in tesla’s calculationsthe bcei memo suggests that putting a fraction of solar to work mining bitcoin would dwarf existing dirty mining operationsthe second major potential impact could be a sizable transformation and greening of the bitcoin mining industry it’s estimated that there’s only  gw of mining capacity worldwide today deploying miners at even  capacity with the above mentioned  of delayed solar and wind projects on us grids alone could result in  gw of new mining capacity effectively dwarfing the entirety of the existing global market  bitcoin is key to an abundant clean energy future  bitcoin clean energy initiative memorandum  april the bcei jack and elon are hinting that this strategy at scale would effectively turn bitcoin into a massive green energy project—unlike anything anyone has ever seen before similar strategies could be used with other energy sources like wind hydro or geothermalbitcoin has the potential to solve one of the greatest challenges facing the solar industry and humanity and the innovators that are going to make it happen just published the game plan in broad daylightthis is a guest post by  opinions expressed
