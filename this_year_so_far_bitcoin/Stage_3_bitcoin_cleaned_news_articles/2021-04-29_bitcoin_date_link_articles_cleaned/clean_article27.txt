investors are confronting difficult questions over whether cryptocurrency investing is compatible with their esg considerations as surging bitcoin prices prompt many managers to consider allocating toward digital assetsbitcoin has rallied over the past year with prices increasing fivefold as the cryptocurrency has garnered mainstream adoption by financial institutions including blackrock morgan stanley and rufferbitcoin has received investment flows of  billion in the yeartodate according to coinshares the wider cryptocurrency market is now worth more than  trillion its highest value ever after doubling in just the last two monthsat the same time interest in sustainable investing has skyrocketed alongside worsening concerns about climate change almost three quarters of institutional investors and fund selectors are now implementing esg strategies according to a recent survey by natixis investment managers citing rising demand from end investorschris clothier fund manager at cg asset management says that “investors with any consideration for esg principles should avoid” investing in bitcoin “bitcoin is nothing short of an environmental catastrophe” wrote clothier in a recent notebitcoin has been under fire for years from environmental activists who criticise the blockchain’s reliance on energyintensive ‘mining’ by computersaccording to the cambridge bitcoin electricity consumption index the bitcoin network consumes more energy in a year than entire countries such as the netherlands argentina and the united arab emirates“bitcoin “miners” are in a race to complete the proof of work against other miners the winner of each race which occurs every  minutes or so is awarded new coins as the value of bitcoin has risen so the prize for “winning” increases and bitcoin miners are incentivised to deploy ever greater resources in pursuit of victory” says clothieraccording to the university of cambridge centre for alternative finance ccaf twothirds of the electricity used by bitcoin miners is generated from fossil fuels moreover most bitcoin mining happens in coalheavy countries like china“bitcoin is much less efficient than the networks it aims to replace it is estimated that a single transaction on the bitcoin network uses as much energy as  transactions on visa” notes clothierbitcoin’s energy consumption is expected to keep rising a recent study in nature communications predicted the blockchain’s annual energy consumption in china will peak in  when it will generate  million metric tons of carbon emissions“the growing energy consumption and associated carbon emission of bitcoin mining could potentially undermine global sustainable efforts” write the authorsclothier believes attempts to reform bitcoin may be difficult given its decentralised nature“like any other human institution bitcoin is capable of reform but its decentralised nature makes change cumbersome whether it is able to reform while retaining its appeal among its proponents remains to be seen for the time being investors with any consideration for esg principles should avoid it”david sneyd vice president of responsible investment at bmo gam says it is “difficult to see how  is consistent with a transition to a low carbon economy”on the positive side sneyd notes that bitcoin may offer social benefits by reducing the cost of remittance corridors between richer and poorer countries through which migrant workers send funds home to their familieshe considers bitcoin a “net negative” from an esg standpoint “as it currently stands the positive potential of bitcoin remains unproven but the negatives are very real and present”“yet that is not necessarily the end of the story as we consider that the blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies has a lot more promise at providing solutions to longstanding esg problems by offering a new method to record information in a manner that is more open while also being secure it could address issues with supply chain traceability renewable energy distribution antimoney laundering and proxy voting” says sneydsome participants in the cryptocurrency market are attempting to change the way bitcoin is mined the bitcoin clean energy initiative bcei was launched by square in december  which committed to invest  million to help drive the use of renewable energy within the bitcoin ecosystem“we believe that cryptocurrency will eventually be powered completely by clean power eliminating its carbon footprint and driving adoption of renewables globally” said square cofounder and ceo jack dorseyin a recent whitepaper bcei suggests that bitcoin miners could become an “energy buyer of last resort” for the excess energy generated solar panels and wind turbines during the daytime despite demand being higher at night“bitcoin miners are unique energy buyers in that they offer highly flexible and easily interruptible load provide payout in a globally liquid cryptocurrency and are completely location agnostic requiring only an internet connection these combined qualities constitute an extraordinary asset an energy buyer of last resort that can be turned on or off at a moment’s notice anywhere in the world”there is some evidence of renewable energy being used to mine bitcoin hydroelectric power plants in china and the democratic republic of congo are popular for crypto mining as the rainy season produces a glut of cheap energymeanwhile asset managers are also attempting to make bitcoin more esgfriendly for investorsone river digital asset management ordam and carbon credit platform moss are launching a ‘carbonneutral’ crypto asset fund promising to offset carbon emissions by buying and planting  tokens for every bitcoin ownedtheres a lot of talk about the carbon footprint of bitcoin we decided its time to stop talking and start doing something about it said ordam chief executive officer eric peters in a bloomberg interviewbrazils moss will be doing the “hard work of actually creating and executing carbon offset programs in the amazon and then tokenising them for use in the crypto space” according to peters “this was a truly needed application of tokens and were looking forward to helping our clients offset their crypto carbon footprintfor now bitcoin’s esg problems are significant enough to create doubts in some investors minds over the cryptocurrencys
