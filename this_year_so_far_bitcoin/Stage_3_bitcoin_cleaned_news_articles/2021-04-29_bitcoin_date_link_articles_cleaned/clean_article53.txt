binance the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange has pushed into a wide range of businesses in recent years in pursuit of profit and industry dominance – from sponsoring its own blockchain to backing a decentralized exchange to launching its own “utility token” bnb now trading at an  billion market capitalizationbut it’s binance’s latest venture a foray into trading tokenized versions of stocks like tesla apple and coinbase that’s now threatening to bring unwanted attention from national and regional regulatorsbinance launched a “stock token” trading service on april  in timing that was notable because it came just a few days before its biggest usbased competitor coinbase pursued a direct stock listing on nasdaqrelated bitcoin struggles near resistance support around according to binance the new offering would let users buy “stock tokens” – representing public companies’ shares or even fractions of shares they’re settled in binance’s own dollarlinked stablecoin binance usd busd the tokens are fully backed by shares held by cmequity ag “a licensed and fully regulated asset management firm in germany”yet red flags are already getting raised by regulators in different countries and regions over the possibility that binance’s new push might run afoul of securities rules“their marketing has been very aggressive and they’ve used that term ‘stock’ very heavily” said henry chong chief executive at hong kongbased digitalasset exchange fusan “i think that’s what is getting really uncomfortable right now”binance says the new stock tokens provided in concert with a german firm are compliant with european market regulationsrelated fed’s powell says market as exemplified by dogecoin is ‘a bit frothy’story continues“stock tokens entitle the holders to gain economic exposure to the underlying shares in a convenient and trusted manner” a binance representative said in an email response on whether the stock tokens should be considered a security the representative said it’s “expected” that there would be an “identical move” in the price of the token whenever the underlying stock goes up or downthe process works like this once a binance user opens a trade in stock tokens a swiss company called digital assets ag daag on behalf of a german firm called cmequity ag purchases the corresponding amount of the company’s shares a token is then minted on a private blockchain by digital assetsthe underlying shares are put into a security account associated with cmequity ag and digital assets ag sends the token through cmequity to binance“it is a financial instrument where people are buying and that’s why binance is a tied agent of cmequity ag” a daag representative said “cmequity ag has the license to sell securities and financial instruments”james angel an associate professor at georgetown university’s mcdonough school of business praised the tokenized stock as an “innovation” but said several risks could arise for people who want to use it“how can you actually trust that token is what it says it is” angel asked “you are not going to have all of the rights of ownership if you own one of these tokens what you basically have is a side bet on the company and the real question is who’s on the other side and is it collateralized to the point where you trust the process”digital assets ag said it is not taking any short positions against the underlying stocks unlike some cfd contract for differences providers in traditional finance“we take the same position as the clients” the company’s representative said “we don’t sell short and we are not selling the order flow to market makers like robinhood”the disadvantage of having no physical headquartersa big question for some cryptocurrencyindustry veterans is why binance didn’t use its own blockchains to mint the tokensbinance has two blockchains binance chain focused on highspeed transactions and binance smart chain to host decentralized finance applications and other digital assets“i don’t understand why people in the digital asset space aren’t just actually issuing tokens that represent equity for real” henry chong the chief executive at hong kongbased digitalasset exchange fusang said “the whole point of blockchain technology is supposed to simplify all of these layers and layers of intermediaries”binance has thrived in part because it’s operated in immature and alwayschanging cryptocurrency markets where regulations aren’t nearly as coordinated across international jurisdictions as mature markets like stocks or even bonds and foreign exchangenotably binance ceo changpeng “cz” zhao has repeatedly refused to answer questions about where his firm is headquartered“they always say they don’t operate in any jurisdiction” chong said“they are working with a regulated german broker for these transactions and apparently made the decision that represented sufficient regulatory cover” richard johnson ceo of texture capital a new yorkbased company that offers tokenized securities for private capital markets said through a spokespersonfor traders there’s also the existential question of whether binance might end the new service abruptly – for any reason reallya twopage “binance stock tokens trading service agreement” on binance’s stock token website says that “binancecom reserves the right to suspend or terminate binance stock tokens trading service without notice if necessary binancecom has the right to suspend and terminate binance stock tokens trading service at any time”alternatives to binance’s stock tokensbinance said in an email to coindesk that the company does not charge commission fees on the tokenized stocks while running a tight spread model the goal for launching the product is to allow users to access the underlying shares in a more affordable waywhile binance’s new service may attract regulatory attention due to the exchange’s size the effort isn’t the first of its kind popular crypto derivatives exchange ftx provides similar products also through a partnership with digital assets ag and cm equityterraform labs’ mirror protocol allows users to mint crypto assets that mimic the value of shares in publicly traded companies“binance doesn’t allow withdrawals because then the underlying broker dealer wouldn’t be able to keep serving binance – it would break the kyc knowyourcustomer chain” do kwon founder and ceo of terraform labs said “so these stock tokens on binance and ftx can never be transferred out and therefore can never be composed into smart contracts”related stories
