“what are we going to learn today doctor” asks scrypt founder xiaohui liu at the start of “bitcoin class with satoshi” episode  this one touches on semantic web applications provably fair gaming verifiable proofs and zeroknowledge proofs it might also make you question what aspects of life are similar to games and even wonder what “proof” actually meansthis edition of the continuing masterclass with bitcoin creator dr craig s wright has more emphasis on practical applications than on theory making it more accessible to a mass audiencethere’s a bit of theory in there too dr wright talks again about performing operations on data in matrix graphs and how applications might handle that data the theme of using “predicate logic” comes up again though it’s discussed in more detail in episode liu and dr wright discuss how a developer might use bitcoin script to set the basic rules on what outcomesresults to verify and feed into bitcoin transactions—while external applications could store and handle the data itself for example in a simple “solve the maze” type situation servers could provide the different methodologies test structures and paths and feed that information into the matrices to produce outcomeslife is like a mud sometimesdr wright also mentions contracts with multiple layers which can be used just as much in business as in games using the classic zork as an example of setting conditionals to handle various player actions and decisions he says it could also apply to situations in the real world where there are various parties who must make agreements or commit to actions and then prove they’ve fulfilled themthis moves on to a discussion of the semantic web—a concept that involves categorizing data on the internet using metadata so it can be more readily relatable to each other and found using naturallanguage searches accomplishing this is easier said than done and involves setting standards writing the algorithms that follow the rules and applying the right metadata to all the information on the internet it could be a perfect opportunity for bitcoin to step in with the metanet with its more secure and provable data handling capabilitieswhile we’re starting to see such unifying logic applied to some aspects of web data dr wright asks “what do you think is missing” the answers are proof and trust how do you prove that semantic web statements are coming from trusted sourcesthe server has to trust the user instead of this we get data silos on web apps like facebook and twitter where the company behind the app has full control over the data and often opaque practices on what they dodon’t regard as “truth”bitcoin allows people to take back some control with builtin identity and by creating hierarchies outside the apps themselves transactions their location and time are all recorded permanently while also if required giving users a degree of privacy dr wright stresses again that this isn’t the same as full anonymity but provides a kind of firewall between addresses involved in transactions and their reallife identities—while also providing the means to verify both if required“i want to see people have more control over their own destiny” dr wright says mentioning that he himself has had problems with twitter and facebook and “deplatforming”but “bitcoin is not about radical decentralization … it’s about security privacy verifiability” whether your concern is owning your own data and what exactly that means proving a credential or just organizing the way business and government operations are performed in a more trusted way bitcoin can provide solutions watch the full episode for more information on the reallife scenarios where this is important and some of the challenges that lie aheadto watch previous episodes of the theory of bitcoin and bitcoin class with satoshi check out the theory of bitcoin youtube channel here and the bitcoin class with satoshi youtube channel herenew to bitcoin check out coingeek’s bitcoin for beginners section the ultimate resource guide to learn more about bitcoin—as originally envisioned by satoshi nakamoto—and blockchain
