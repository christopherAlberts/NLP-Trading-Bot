whether youre a relatively new investor or someone whos been putting their money to work on wall street for decades theres always something new and interesting to see last year it was the unparalleled uncertainty that arose from a onceinacentury pandemic in  its been the rise of the retail investorwhile a lot of retail investors have been focusing on stocks with high levels of short interest  eg gamestop and amc entertainment  weve also witnessed a huge bump in cryptocurrency valuations as a result of young investors putting their money to work in recent weeks bitcoin cryptobtc the worlds largest digital currency nearly hit  while ethereum surpassed but its not bitcoin or ethereum that are creating the loudest buzz among crypto enthusiasts at the moment that title belongs to dogecoin cryptodogeat one point last week dogecoin tokens were going for north of  that may not sound like a lot but it gave the digital currency a market cap of more than  billion to put this into some context dogecoin was worth more than the market value of companies like kraft heinz ford and twitter it also briefly made dogecoin one of the five mostvaluable digital currenciesdaily trading volume has also gone through the roof roughly one year ago  million to  million dogecoin were traded daily over the past two weeks weve witnessed anywhere from  billion to  billion dogecoin change hands on a daily basis in short its become the poster child of crypto momentum in a matter of monthsbut even with a roughly  gain over the  period dogecoin has all the look of a pumpanddump asset that investors should avoid like the plague here are five key reasons dogecoin belongs nowhere near investors portfolios extremely limited utilityarguably the biggest knock against dogecoin and crypto in general is that theres virtually no realworld use for these tokens according to online business directory cryptwerk in the neighborhood of  businesses now accept payment or tips in dogecoin meanwhile international business times listed  companies that took dogecoin as payment six weeks agoneither figure is very high when you consider that the us has more than  million businesses by itself and there are an estimated  million entrepreneurs worldwide the point is this dogecoin is a novelty currency that has virtually no use unlimited supplylike bitcoin dogecoin is a decentralized network that utilizes proofofwork as a means to validate transactions this means cryptocurrency miners use highpowered computers to solve complex equations to validate groups of transactions known as a block for doing so theyre given a block reward which currently equates to  dogecoin worth about heres where things get interesting a block reward is handed out every minute thats  new dogecoin every hour  million new tokens every day and close to  billion new dogecoin being virtually minted every yeartheres no supply cap on how many dogecoin can circulate with  billion dogecoin already in supply as of this past weekend investors are constantly seeing the value of their holdings diluted with each new block reward a lack of differentiationif you need another good reason to avoid dogecoin like the plague take a gander at its backstory in  two software developers  billy markus and jackson palmer  came up with the idea of combining two of the buzziest things on the internet at the time into one they took the extremely popular shiba inu dog meme and after three hours of writing code turned it into its own cryptocurrencynot too long after creating dogecoin markus and palmer stepped away leaving community developers to fill the void and ensure the lights stayed on so to speak these multiple years without true development have left dogecoin without much differentiation this is to say that its no different than dozens of other tradable cryptocurrencies no fundamental catalystsa fourth reason to be highly skeptical of dogecoin is the lack of true fundamental catalysts although the phrase fundamental catalyst has a completely different meaning for digital currencies tangible drivers can be found within the crypto movement for example tesla motors buying  billion in bitcoin and announcing it would accept payment in bitcoin stands out as a realworld catalystcomparatively dogecoin has no realworld catalysts its ascent has been driven by social media hype with none other than tesla ceo elon musk behind most of the pumpingsince the vast majority of dogecoin is owned by retail investors and not institutions emotions have also played a key role the thing about emotions is that theyre short term in nature and can shift at any moment even its codeveloper is taken aback by its valuationif all of this is still not enough to convince you that dogecoin is an awful investment listen to what someone who might know a thing or two about dogecoin had to say codeveloper billy markus this week on twitter markus who is no longer involved with the development of dogecoin told me that he like the coin and that its worth whatever people buy it forbut in an interview with the wall street journal following dogecoins ascent to  earlier this year markus proclaimedthe idea of dogecoin being worth  cents is the same as gamestop being worth  it doesnt make sense its super absurd the coin design was absurddogecoin may have partially outgrown its meme status but itll always be that digital currency founded as a joke that lacks the differentiation and utility to be meaningful in the real world
