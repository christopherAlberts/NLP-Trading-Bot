the benefits of coupling ethereum with bitcoin cash smartbch sidechain testnet is now publicon thursday the smart bitcoin cash team announced the launch of the smartbch testnet explaining that developers and decentralized app makers can now experiment and develop with the highperformance evmcompatible bitcoin cash sidechain further bitcoincom news spoke with wang kui the lead developer of the smartbch project the smartbch tech lead told our newsdesk about the inner workings of the sidechain that can connect with the ethereum networktestnet for smart bitcoin cash a bitcoin cash  project is liveduring the last few weeks the smartbch project has been a topical conversation within the bitcoin cash bch community the reason for these conversations is because the smartbch team has revealed a project that is evm and  compatible but far cheaper in terms of transaction fees this is because the smartbch project is a sidechain built on bitcoin cash and it leverages the bch chain’s lower transaction fees bitcoincom has reported on the project on a few occasions since it was announced and on april  the team has revealed the smartbch testnet is now livethe smartbch testnet will allow decentralized application dapp creators and programmers the ability to test and deploy experimental projects using the testing framework developers should read the recently published smartbch testnet documentation before getting started the team’s testnet announcement notes that the bch community has been waiting for this project to go live and said the project telegram channel has swelled with membersfor instance the coinflex exchange has had its development team testing the testnet of smartbch while it was still private “metamask is connecting without issue and solidity code is working well we set up a dex on our private testnet created tokens…and it’s all going smoothly” mark lamb ceo of coinflex said the smartbch team says the concept is the firstofitskind sidechain for bitcoin cash and there are many benefits bch offers“bitcoin cash itself is not specifically equipped for smart contracting functions preferring use cases centered around peertopeer cash” the smartbch team said on wednesday “however as a sidechain to bitcoin cash smartbch aims to build a new playground for the bitcoin cash ecosystem and enlarge the user base” wang kui the lead developer of the smartbch further discussed the protocol with bitcoincom news this weekwang kui stresses that the protocol provides an evm and  compatible sidechain for bitcoin cash staking its hash power while utilizing bch as the native gaspaying token “what’s more by incorporating hardwarefriendly components vastly increased scalability is unlocked” kui remarked moreover the smartbch tech lead discussed the project in great detail with bitcoincom news in an exclusive interview transcribed belowan indepth interview with the smart bitcoin cash tech lead wang kuibitcoincom news bcn what made you decide to start such a venture and why did you choose to leverage the bitcoin cash networkwang kui wk i have been talking about the project background since the second half of  i have been working on how to maximize tps transactions per second but the work has been on and off as i was assigned with other tasks by the second half of  i finally found a feasible way after many failures after discussing the idea with industry leaders we decided to deliver my research results by launching smartbchthe main reason for choosing the bitcoin cash network is that it features big blocks based on my professional background and work experience i think optimization measures should be taken to give full play to the ability of the computing system itself you can call it ‘brute force’ however ethereum prefers ‘subtle’ ways like sharding and  the reason i choose to leverage the bitcoin cash protocol is because i’m a big supporter of bitcoin cash and i think it is the most in line with the original vision of satoshi which is to “serve as many people as possiblebcn can you explain to our readers how smartbch aims to enhance evm throughput and  appswk first we abandoned the singlethread semantics defined in ethereum’s yellow paper singlethread semantics is not a must to support evm and  and it blocks many optimizations second we developed a lot of lowlevel libraries which support parallel execution of evm transactions to exploit the potential of modern cpu and ssd last but not least we optimized the evm execution engine and storage engine which makes each evm instruction run fasterbcn have thirdparty bch developers been looking into the smartbch protocolwk yes we will have several companies confirmed and will join our testnet and participate to be the validator and we have several new applications developed and dedicated for smartbch and several existing applications being ported to smartbchbcn the throughput is quoted as being “one billion gas every  seconds” can you explain how that will workwk ethereum’s consensus engine and execution engine must be run in serial and in the block interval the new block must be executed several times on different peertopeer nodes because it uses the proofofwork pow consensus algorithm by optimizing the consensus algorithm and allowing the consensus engine and execution engine to run concurrently we must speed it by about five timesby executing the evm transactions in parallel we can speed up the execution by about ten times and by reducing each evm instruction’s time consumption we can further speed it up by about two to three times so overall we are confident to speed up ethereum by  timesbcn how will bitcoin cash miners be affected by smartbchwk bitcoin cash miners can vote for their validators on smartbch and get gas fee rewards such that they can benefit from decentralized finance defi applications on smartbchbcn would you say that smartbch will be able to produce the same results as a myriad of the defi apps built on ethereum like stablecoins amms liquidity pools decentralized exchanges dexs and tools of that naturewk all the ethereum defi apps can be ported to smartbch with negligible efforts also we are expecting new applications which require highthroughput and lowgasprice to run will emerge on smartbchbcn when you say “smart bitcoin cash’s innovation lies in libraries” what does that meanwk instead of inventing fancy consensus and cryptographic algorithms we decided to adopt another methodology to develop lowlevel libraries with an aim to fully uncover the hardware’s potential especially its inherent parallelism ordinary users and developers are provided with a compatibility layer supporting evm and  so the optimized lowlevel ‘close to the metal’ libraries themselves remain concealed by this layer of abstraction during the implementation we used the codename ‘moeing’ which is added to the libraries’ names as prefixthese libraries follow the unix philosophy simple short clear modular and extensible other projects can reuse them and benefit from thembcn as far as cryptocurrency in general do you envision the industry seeing exponential growth going forward as we have seen during the end of  and into wk i am not sure about what will happen in the near future but in the long run the population of the cryptocurrency community will surely grow exponentially and smartbch is getting ready for the next  growth of onchain userswhat do you think about smartbch launching its testnet this week and the interview with the project’s tech lead wang kui let us know what you think
