when terrance leonard first started seriously investing in the cryptocurrency space in  his original goal was to achieve financial independencethe longterm plan was to invest enough in crypto that he could cash out of some of those investments purchase realestate assets and rent those out to earn additional income that way he wouldn’t necessarily need to a work a traditional job to make ends meetbut then his ideal home came on the market leonard who works as a software engineer in washington dc already owned a rowhome but he wanted a home with a larger yard for his dog to play in and a garage“i thought ‘this is exactly what i want’” leonard said “and i’m ready to pull the trigger right now”to afford the  home leonard opted to use his cryptocurrency investments to cover a down payment and as proof of funds for the mortgage he took out to buy the home — he opted for a mortgage rather than buying the home outright because of the low interestrate environmentthe process as he would find out wasn’t as simple as transferring his cryptocurrency holdings to the relevant parties “there was back and forth between the lender and the title company making sure that was ok” leonard saidthe winning crypto strategy think of the dotcom bubblearound two years ago leonard went allin on crypto taking a big bet on the relatively new asset class “when i realized the potential of crypto — and i realized how well it was doing for me in the beginning — i sold all of my stocks my  everything and moved it all into crypto” leonard saidtoday he attributes his ability to purchase his “perfect” home to the success of the investing strategy he adopted “without investing in crypto there would have been no way that i would have been able to buy this at the time when it came on the market” he saidso what was that strategy to take a longterm approach and target coins that are wellpositioned for longevity that means no meme coins like dogecoin dogeusd  instead leonard likes to think of the crypto market as being in a similar position as the dotcom boom was in the  before the bust “i’m looking for the googles googl   the hps hpe   the oracles orcl   ” he said“ ‘without investing in crypto there would have been no way that i would have been able to buy this at the time when it came on the market’ ” — terrance leonard a software engineer and crypto investorhe looks at the top  coins and goes from there some of his investments were in bitcoin btcusd  and ethereum ethusd   but the bulk of his money went toward purchasing chainlink linkusd   a cryptocurrency launched in  that sends realworld data to blockchainsterrance leonard pictured in front of the home he recently bought in washington dc courtesy of terrance leonardusing cryptocurrency to get a mortgage isn’t foolproofwhen leonard bought his first home the process was quite standard as a veteran he was able to take advantage of the va loan program and the process was “pretty seamless”originally he reached out to his lender veterans united home loans to see if he could refinance the loan on his first home to convert it into an investment property which would allow him to get a va loan for his new home ultimately that wasn’t possibleso when leonard had to get another loan to purchase the property that caught his eye he figured he would use his crypto profits for his down payment and the earnestmoney deposit this time around the process wasn’t as seamless“there were some issues with proof of funds” leonard said “i just wanted to be able to say ‘here’s my wallet’”“ home buyers will generally have to convert crypto assets into cash to use them for the down payment on a home ”he couldn’t just transfer over the crypto investments or show his account on coinbase to satisfy the lender and his title company instead he needed to cash out into a bank account like someone might do with money earned in the stock marketthe process might have been easier had leonard sought out a home from a realestate broker who specializes in transactions involving cryptocurrency some brokerages have begun listing properties where the seller only wants to be paid in cryptocurrency sometimes specifying a specific investment vehicle unfortunately for leonard those brokerages didn’t have the types of properties he wanted plus he wasn’t necessarily inclined to make an allcash or rather allcrypto deal“we had the lowest interest rates in a very long time so i was not going to pass up on that opportunity” he said adding that he’s more likely to see a better return on his crypto investments even after taxes than he would if he sunk all his money into the homefor lenders the paper trail is keyin the mortgage and realestate industries the use of cryptocurrency investments to purchase homes is still very much a novel concept and lenders are still wrapping their heads around how to treat those assetscrypto is such a new concept that even determining how many loans have involved home buyers with crypto investments is a challenge said chris birk director of education at veterans united “mortgage origination software doesn’t have fields for tracking something like this” birk saidright now lenders are flying blind with these prospective borrowers as regulators and other mortgage entities are only just beginning to put out guidelines for how to gauge the soundness of crypto assetsfannie mae fnma   one of the two governmentsponsored enterprises that securitizes a majority of the mortgages nationwide requires proceeds from bitcoin and other digital currencies to be converted into us currency for them to be eligible assets when underwriting a loan fannie also requires documentation showing the digital currency was owned by the borrowerhowever freddie mac fmcc  does not consider cryptocurrency to be an eligible source of funds and other agencies have yet to provide any specific guidance the department of veterans affairs has no regulations in place that specifically reference cryptocurrency an agency spokesman said but the va does require verification of deposits“ lenders may request a  to  transaction history for crypto accounts ”lenders will generally request a paper trail demonstrating a  to  transaction history for the crypto account but as birk noted in a recent blog post cryptocurrency accounts don’t always provide monthly statements as a bank would and for the time being lenders will expect borrowers to cash out their crypto investments early in the process“you can’t pay your closing costs with a van gogh — it’s the same with your bitcoin” birk said “it’s going to have to be converted it’s going to have to be seasons and there’s going to be documentation to satisfy the lender”in part this strict approach is reflective of mortgage companies’ responsibilities to flag potential criminal behavior including money laundering underwriters need to be able to see potential red flags which isn’t as easy with crypto wallets per sedespite the hassles he faced with buying his new home leonard isn’t deterred from investing in crypto right now he still earns enough from his remaining crypto investments to cover the mortgage payments on his former home“i’m not in a rush to sell” leonard said “i want to make sure that i make the right financial play”
