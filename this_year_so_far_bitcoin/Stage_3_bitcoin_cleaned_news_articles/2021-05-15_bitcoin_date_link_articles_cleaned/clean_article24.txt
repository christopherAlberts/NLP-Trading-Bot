bitcoin has been one of the star postcrash assets institutional investors finally started taking a serious interest in the world’s leading cryptocurrency and the market followed the lead but it’s really thanks to retail investors following the “hodl” mantra that the crypto has sustained its value for this long even though the growth momentum that caused the stock to reach new heights has run out the crypto hasn’t crashed yet and it’s hovering above but even if bitcoin is winning in investor loyalty and stability if we measure different cryptos by the mainstream “attention” they are getting the “joke crypto” dogecoin might have a slight edge over bitcoin most of this attention can be attributed to elon musk who at best is taking a joke too far and at worst is manipulating crypto investorsthere is no denying that people have made a lot of money in a relatively short amount of time with both bitcoin and dogecoin but if the crypto “waters” are too unpredictable for you to swim in let’s stick with the stocksa recreational product companynow that the pandemic is finally being under control in canada people will try to reclaim as much normalcy as they can and might try and make up for the lost time this has the potential to increase the sales of a company like brp tsxdoonasdaqdooo brp makes snowmobiles atvs motorcycles and personal watercraft so no matter what “terrain” you are on a brpmade vehicle can make your passage more funthe company saw two tragic quarters last year in terms of revenue but the situation has improved substantially in the last two quarters the balance sheet of the company is a little unbalanced but apart from that one chink in the armour brp is a great pick especially for its capital growth the stock rose over  in the last five years and if you believe it can replicate this feat in the next five years then it’s a stock worth having tsx stocks under  click here to learn morea tech companyshopify tsxshopnyseshop is one of the most soughtafter growth stock s that’s currently trading on the tsx it was a millionairemaker stock but it’s difficult to say whether it still is or not the stock has reached new heights and even though there is little doubt that there might still be a lot of growth in shopify’s future it will unlikely be anything like the magnificent fourdigit growth the company has displayed in the last few yearsstill shopify might be a more predictable and reliable way to grow your capital compared to bitcoin and dogecoin unlike the two speculative assets shopify’s future growth will depend upon the growth of the ecommerce market which is a certainty and shopify’s position among similar platformsfoolish takeawaycryptocurrencies whether you go with something as relatively credible as bitcoin or a financial joke that has grown out of hand dogecoin all come with a higher level of volatility compared to even the most aggressive growth stocks and if that’s beyond your risk appetite it’s a good idea to stick with the stocks backed by tangible assets instead of an asset class that fluctuates consistently
