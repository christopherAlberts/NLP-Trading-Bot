demystifying the cryptocurrency champion that’s defied legacy and taken the new world by storm is it a bankable investment or notin  january  the pseudonymous satoshi nakamoto made the firstever bitcoin btc transaction sending  btcs to developer hal finney and just like that a new asset or rather a new asset class was born never mind that the ‘value’ of the asset was still minuscule the firstever usdbtc rate was    btc or inversely  btc was worth just  or a mere  cents on october  a few months later on  february  the firstever bitcoin exchange was establishedgoing back a bit further triggered by the  financial crisis nakamoto mined the firstever bitcoin block named the genesis block on  january  awarding satoshi the first  bitcoins of the  million that will ever be created to put this in perspective about  million bitcoins have already been created leaving only  million or so to be minedin may  a developer and early adopter laszlo offered  btc for two large pizzas in bitcointalkorg someone took him up on that offer with a cost of around  dollars these pizzas set the first “reallife” value for bitcoin at  dollars this was a significant milestone and has since been celebrated in the ecosystem as “bitcoin pizza day”on  february  bitcoin reached parity with the dollar on mt gox a bitcoin exchange that dominated the market until february  on  it reached  by  june it climbed to its highest price yet of  only to plummet again to  four days later on  june this movement would be known as “the great bubble of ” and it wouldn’t be the last parabolic movement in bitcoin pricesin april  bitcoin price surpassed  for the first time and the market cap broke the  billiondollar threshold bitcoin reached  before crashing again to around  after another exchange hack that’s when governments began to notice bitcoin and tried to figure out how to categorise regulate or even control this new digital currencyin october  the fbi managed to shut down the infamous dark web site silk road and seize its assets this cast a shadow on bitcoin as the coin of criminals and money launderingbut once again bitcoin saw a huge price surge going from a little over  in october to breaking the  barrier in november but a ban from china and the bankruptcy of mt gox both in a span of a couple of months drove the price down again and bitcoin didn’t reach that psychological barrier again until january  was a very interesting year for bitcoin and the ecosystem in general there were innovations like multimillion initial coin offerings icos forked coins etc and of course the bull run brought a lot of buzz around “the new digital currency” the cryptocurrency rallied from around the  mark to almost  by december in  bitcoin also gained more legitimacy among lawmakers and legacy financial companies for example japan passed a law to accept bitcoin as a legal payment method and russia had announced that it will legalise the use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin however by  regulations also started creeping up in january  south korea brought in a regulation that requires all bitcoin traders to reveal their identity thus putting a ban on anonymous trading of bitcoinscome march  bitcoin was no exception to the “dash for cash” considering it tanked more than  per cent at the height of the covid crisis to  but the rebound has been as fierce it hit an alltime high of  on  april  the recent top came in coincidentally on the exact same day that we witnessed a bumper listing of coinbase coin on nasdaq at an eyepopping valuation of  billionmeanwhile acceptance of this novel cryptocurrency kept accelerating in october  paypal launched a new service enabling users to buy hold and sell cryptocurrency and in march  elon musk tweeted “you can now buy a tesla with bitcoin”how bitcoin worksimagine a pearl lying on the sidewalk i find that pearl and give it to you you now have one pearl and i have zero now let’s look closely at what happened i put my pearl in your hand we both know it was real we experienced itdid we need a third person to confirm that this transfer occurred no so what does this mean well the pearl is now yours i can’t give you another pearl because i gave you my only one i am officially “pearlless” and you are currently in full control of that pearl you can give it to a friend and they can give it to someone else and so on or you could just leave it on the sidewalk the choice is yours that’s how an inperson exchange worksnow let’s say i have one “digital pearl” and i give it to you the problem how would you know that i didn’t duplicate the digital pearl before sending it to you how would you know i didn’t send the same pearl to my friend on instagram you wouldn’t know only i would now you can see that this digital exchange has some significant flaws sending digital pearls is not the same as sending physical pearls this problem has a name it’s called “double spending”just like a physical ledger where you record all transactions we need a digital ledger for the above online transfer or transaction and have someone in charge of it however that brings up another issue what if the person in charge of the ledger wanted to create some more digital pearls well they could no one’s stopping them from addingbringing more pearls into existence thus adding to the supply and reducing its valuethere is a second issue when i first gave you my pearl it was just you and me imagine that the person in charge has to verify the ledger every time there is an exchange not very efficient is it here’s where bitcoin comes up with a nifty solution — a “peertopeer” networkwhat if we gave this ledger to everybody instead of a single ledger living on a third party’s computer everyone involved would have a copy of all the transactions that have ever happened these digital pearl transactions are recorded on everyone’s ledger so you can’t cheat i can’t send you digital pearls i don’t have since that wouldn’t sync in with everyone in the system it would be a tough system to beat especially if you need to change hundreds of thousands of other ledgers as the system gets bigger it also gets harder to hack or take control ofplus it’s decentralised so no one can decide to give themselves more digital pearls the rules of the system were defined at the beginning and the code and rules are open sourceyou could participate in this network update the ledger and make sure it all checks out “mining bitcoin” in fact that’s the only way to create more digital pearls in the system for your trouble you could get some digital pearls as a reward this system exists and is called the “bitcoin protocol” all those digital pearls are the bitcoins within the systemthe rules define the total supply of bitcoin subject to a total maximum of  million as mentioned earlier when i make an exchange i can certify that the bitcoin left my possession and is now entirely yours because it’s a public ledger i didn’t need a third party to make sure i didn’t cheat we can now deal with  bitcoins or  million bitcoins or even a tiny fraction of a bitcoin i can send it with a click of a button even if i was in dubai and you were in denmark or denverbitcoin vs gold store of valuebitcoin is largely being touted as “digital gold” or as a store of value however gold itself survived the end of gold coinage the rise of paper money the end of the gold standard and so on it fended off many challenges to become what it is todayso it is only natural to expect that we will witness volatility in this novel asset classpayment system here the idea of antifragility could be applicable ie the more it survives the more reputable it becomeson a comparison with gold this is what vineet arora managing director bta wealth management has to say “bitcoin is to millennials what gold was to a generation ago it’s liquid mobile hedges against inflation and gives growth all attributes that we grew up associating with gold the current generation associates with bitcoin whether we like it or like to dislike it it’s here to stay”the safety aspect depends on an investor’s definition of “safe” let’s consider two simple ways of assessing this price volatility and maximum drawdown the maximum decline from a high peak to a pullback lowif we look at volatility bitcoin is more than five times as volatile as gold and  times as volatile as the us dollar meanwhile the maximum drawdown of bitcoin is a whopping  per cent compared to  per cent and  per cent for gold and usd respectively another empirical evidence of bitcoin’s notorious risk profile can be encapsulated by looking at the maximum oneday loss registered —  per cent on  march  doesn’t look like a store of value does itanother possible risk is the complete loss of principal by storing your bitcoins on an exchange wallet “hot wallet” or “online wallet” you are taking on counterparty risk hack default etc a “cold wallet” comes in handy here a cold wallet is a wallet that is not connected to the internet and therefore stands a far lesser risk of being compromiseddoes this mean bitcoin should not be a part of an investment portfolio “i wouldn’t dismiss it just yet” says harsh shivlani of first global “rather than assess it only on a standalone basis it is important to look at any investment as part of a portfolio to assess whether it adds any value in terms of riskadjusted return to your original portfolio”will the future of currency be digitalthe primary goal of any form of currency is to be a reliable and convenient source of payment for this to happen you would expect the value of the currency to be fairly stable over time and the infrastructure surrounding it to have the ability to process sizeable transactions relatively quicklycurrently bitcoin can’t come even close to competing with legacy payment systems with a capacity of just  transactions per second and confirmation times of  minutes on average it’s far behind visa’s maximum capacity of  transactions per second and its nearly instant paymentsfurthermore because only so many transactions can fit in a block when the network is congested fees skyrocket in a bidding war between users to get their transaction in the next block however there are certain upgrades in line that could solve all these problems such as the “lightning network”according to a survey by the bank for international settlements one in  central banks expect to issue their own digital currencies within the next three yearsthe views on cryptocurrencies remain quite diverse “while cbdcs may replace currency in the near term i still find it hard to accept bitcoin or any altcoins as a store of value and a medium of exchange blockchain as a technology however does seem poised for a great future” says prashant mehta chief investment officer kef holdings ltdon the other hand devvrat moondhra director duro steel ag and blockchain investor says “bitcoin is like religion initially there are few believers and many nonbelievers atheists but eventually there are more and more believers following which there is mass adoption we are still early in the adoption cycle… there will be volatility but in the long run bitcoin will become a store of value like gold is”devina mehra is cofounder of first global a global quantitative asset management group the views expressed are personal
