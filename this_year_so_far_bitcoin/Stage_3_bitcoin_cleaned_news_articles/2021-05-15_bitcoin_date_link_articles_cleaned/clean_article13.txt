historically activity surrounding the bitcoin btc monthly futures and options expiry has been blamed for weakening bullish momentum a few studies from  found a  average drop in btc price  hours before the cme futures settlement datehowever as cointelegraph reported in june  the effect faded away while  seems to have rejected the potential negative impact of cme expiries so far the current year appears to validate the theory bitcoin’s price has been suppressed ahead of futures and options expiry in the first three months of bitcoin performance before and after cme expiry usd source tradingviewsome investors and traders have pointed out that bitcoin’s incredible rally after the recent futures and options expiry dates has become a trendbtc options expiry in about  hourslast friday of every month has been a pretty good entry point for past  months past  months price has been hammered in the hours  days leading up to expiryobservation not advice lets see if the pattern holds  — 阿龍 knutsonjesse april  btc has effectively rallied in the days following the expiry but expanding this analysis uncovers a lessthansatisfactory trendthree consecutive events don’t prove a trendthe past  months have been nothing short of spectacular for bitcoin as the cryptocurrency posted  gains august  turned out to be the worst month as btc presented a  negative performance thus choosing random starting points within the month will likely show a similar positive trendfor example if one uses the “last quarter” moon phase as a proxy the odds that a rally takes place after each event are very highbitcoin performance after “last quarter” moon usd source tradingviewas depicted above indeed bitcoin rallied after five out of the last six instances the only conclusion might be that positive trends are the norm rather than the exception during bull runsalthough there might be some explanation to the reason behind bitcoin’s endofthemonth underperformance these are only hypotheseswhile market makers and arbitrage desks could benefit from suppressing the price after a rally other forces including leverage futures longs and call option holders would balance that outbitcoin price did not drop in three of the last seven expiriestherefore it makes sense to analyze the potential price suppression ahead of the expiry instead of looking for explanations for a rally during a bull marketbitcoin performance before and after cme expiry in  usd source tradingviewboth october and december  expiries failed to present any negative pressure ahead of such dates meanwhile the  positive performance on the five days that preceded the most recent april  expiry also puts a big question mark on how meaningful the cme event really isconsidering there hasn’t been a price decrease ahead of monthly futures and options expiries in three of the last seven instances this evidence should put a nail in the coffin of the unfounded mythas mentioned earlier trying to develop theories on why sellers acted more aggressively on specific dates is unlikely to yield resultsas shown above bitcoin’s price failed to underperform in three out of the last seven expiries a  success rate should not define a trend when a positive performance after a specific date has been proven common during a bull runthe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of cointelegraph every investment and trading move involves risk you should conduct your own research when making a decision
