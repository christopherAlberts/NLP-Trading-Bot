while bitcoin energy concerns grow nobody discusses the carbon and military violence backing us dollarsthis week a great number of bitcoin supporters and skeptics have been arguing over whether or not bitcoin mining is harmful to the global environment however crypto supporters have been saying that concerns over the bitcoin network’s energy supply are absurd in contrast to the carbon used and the military violence that backs a number of fiat currencies including the us dollar one could even go as far as to say that the american dollar alone has left boot prints on large groups of humans over the years and desecrated entire countriesmusk and dorsey still use us dollars when they know the currency leverages massive amounts of carbon and military forceelon musk and his electric car company tesla ignited a ferocious debate over bitcoin mining and how it affects the global environment similarly the founder of square and twitter jack dorsey added fuel to the argument when his company’s cfo said the payment firm has no current plans to buy more bitcoin btcdorsey then tweeted that “changes everything…for the better” and further added “we will forever work to make bitcoin better”however people have been questioning musk and dorsey’s stance as the two have not discussed the carbon used by the us dollar or the military violence that is tethered to the american currency despite the dollar’s obvious problems musk and dorsey’s companies have accepted usd without hesitationmoreover musk himself has been called out over hypocrisy the popular stocktoflow creator “plan b” shared a photo with musk of a tesla car using energy that derived from power stemming from a coal facility in north dakotait is well known that the us dollar is tied to violence and manipulation that is bolstered by the militaryindustrial complex in fact most people believe the american military occupation abroad and more specifically in the middle east has been kept there to maintain the us hegemony and petrodollarafter franklin d roosevelt fdr quite literally flipped the american economy upside down global financiers invoked the bretton woods pact which was the first step in establishing the petrodollar these days a great number of economists and analysts have said on multiple occasions that the petrodollar and the us hegemony is overpeople should ask if musk and dorsey have contemplated the proofofwork behind the us dollar and the petrodollar’s effects on the global economy it’s well documented that the american dollar’s consensus algorithm is backed by violent measures and sanctionsthe us dollar has made it so america has been a bully of other nations and feels the need to step in as the world police but environmentalists have added zero concerns about the us dollar and they gladly accept usd to fund their goals the founder of watchdog capital bruce fenton tweeted about this hypocrisy on friday fenton saidan  abrams tank uses jet fuel that costs  a gallon  delivered it burns a gallon a minute when driving a gallon every  min when idle in afghanistan they leave the tanks on all night the war has been going for two decades don’t  me about bitcoin energy usagestudy shows the protector of the petrodollar is a bigger polluter than as many as  countriesfenton’s critique is quite valid but people like elon musk or jack dorsey have yet to address such subjects the us military which keeps the dollar going strong depends on massive amounts of fuel and has one of the largest carbon footprints on earth this fact is well documented and the us military cannot escape the massive amounts of carbon it uses on a daily basis“us military spending is greater than the total military spending of the next seven countries combined china saudi arabia india france russia united kingdom and germany” explains data from street smart economics in fact the “price we pay for militarism” is colossal but the us government sweeps it all under the rug“this kind of information is readily available” street smart economics’ author martin hartlandsberg details “the military’s contribution to global warming is not one reason is that because of us government pressure the governments negotiating the  kyoto protocol agreed that emissions generated by military activity would not count as national emissions and would not have to be reported as a consequence the intergovernmental panel on climate change which produces one of the world’s most trusted reports on the rate at which climate change is occurring does not include national military emissions in its calculations”on june   the website theconversationcom tried to initiate a conversation about us military spending and its carbon footprint the three authors benjamin neimark oliver belcher and patrick bigger show data that indicates “the us military is a bigger polluter than as many as  countries” the researchers’ study highlights how the us military leverages carbonbased fuels more so than any entity in history“the us military is one of the largest polluters in history consuming more liquid fuels and emitting more climatechanging gases than most mediumsized countries” the researchers’ study insists “if the us military were a country its fuel usage alone would make it the  largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world sitting between peru and portugal”there is countless evidence that shows the us military is used to bolster the country’s currency and keep it in place as the world reserve currency historical records show that the us government’s proofofwork system for the us dollar was not a fairly distributed peertopeer currency systemfor  years or more now the global elite has manipulated ledgers and created an immoral social and financial ranking system elon musk and the rest of the socalled environmentalists speaking out against the bitcoin network should really consider what the us dollar has done and what the fiat currency continues to dodo you think concerns over the bitcoin network’s energy use are overblown do you think people should be discussing the carbon and violence that backs usd let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section
