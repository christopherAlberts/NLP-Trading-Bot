the virtues of bitcoin reflect those that make up the foundation of the islamic holiday“o you who have believed decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous” — quran fasting is one of the special rituals of islam it encourages and teaches patience and delaying gratification both of which are essentials to the bitcoin philosophy so what does bitcoin have to do with ramadanarabic etymology of fasting and ramadanṣawm arabic for fasting means abstention this includes potentially abstention from food drink sexual intercourse andor speaking fasting in the islamic sense is the abstention from food drink and sexual intercourse during the day ramadan is the month in which muslims are obligated to fastthe etymology and meaning of ramaḍan is a disputable matter in the sources some say it means “hot weather” and it’s named so because when they chose the name it was hot others say it’s “the rain in the end of summer and the beginning of the fall” or “the rain that finds the land burning when fallen” from the word “ramaḍi” solving this dispute however is beyond this article’s topicif you ask muslims about the moral of ṣawm many will say “it’s about sympathy for the poor and the disadvantaged” however many muslim philosophers and philologists hold that it’s about patience delaying gratification and selffulfillment we read in the old arabic dictionary lisan alarab “fasting is patience” this brings us to the next idea hodling is ṣawmhodling as fastingthe philosophy of hodling held mainly by bitcoin maximalists has an underlying principle rooted in austrian economics namely time preference in economics time preference is the current relative valuation placed on receiving a good or some cash at an earlier date compared with receiving it at a later date hodling is a low time preference action because its an abstention from spending bitcoin on expedient goods services or products trading on the other hand is high time preference since it’s focused on making fast gains or interestṣawm has the same underlying principle as hodling that is delaying gratification muslims abstain from eating drinking and having any sexual intercourse during the day so that they can receive god’s blessing by being more righteous fasting and bitcoin each in its unique way incentivize low time preference and delayed gratification both of which in turn usher in selffulfillmentyou can conceptualize the effect of low time preference as anticonsumerism sound money ie bitcoin is always incompatible with consumerism how is thatbitcoin as ramadias we have said earlier ramaḍi means the rain that falls and finds the land burning the word is cognate to the word ramaḍan itselfin our world of hyperinflation consumerism is incentivized by inflating the money supply ie printing more money “how is that” you might ask well if your money purchasing power is always being decreased then purchasing things now rather than later would be the best for you on the contrary in a sound money ie bitcoin system holding money is incentivized because the purchasing power of each unit is continuously increasing rather than decreasing thus encouraging hodling and low time preferencebitcoin is the ramaḍi to our hyperinflated world it’s the antidote to its inefficient monetary system that is unjustly stealing purchasing power from the poor making it more and more difficult for them to buy literally anything bitcoin extinguishes the fire of hyperinflation as the ramaḍi rain extinguishes the burning land it ushers in a new world of low time preference high productivity and low consumerismfrom idea to expression the night of power and sound moneythe night of power is the night within which the quran was sent down most muslims hold that the night was in late ramadan however some scholars believe it can be any day in the yearin the night of power ismaili muslims believe that “the holy spirit inspired the book kitāb in a spiritual form into the heart and soul of the prophet” then the prophet used his soul and imaginal faculty to express divine inspiration finally this expression got recorded and distributed between muslimsthe process of creating bitcoin was similar to that first the idea of sound money with limited supply showed up in satoshi’s mind then he used his imaginal faculty to express it in code finally this code was published so that everyone can run bitcoin and enable the first sound money in the history of manan ismaili commentator said “in the universal sense the night of power is the spiritual state of receptivity to the holy spirit” now we might ask is sound money what god wants for usthe only legitimate money“o you who have believed do not consume one anothers wealth unjustly but only  trade by mutual consent…” — quran “inflation being a fraudulent invasion of property could not take place on the free market” — murray rothbardcontinuously printed by central banks fiat money is a system of continuous devouring of other people’s money and time without any consent and thus it’s illegitimate central banks and governments in general are the first and foremost privileged party in this process in which other people have no choice due to regulations that prevent using other currencies this control over the free choice in market is also one thing that is not compatible with islam even though some muslim countries have no problem implementing it let’s see this hadith “when prices were high in the prophet’s time the people asked him to fix prices for them but he replied ‘god is the one who fixes prices who withholds gives lavishly and provides and i hope that when i meet my lord none of you will have any claim on me for an injustice regarding blood or property’” so fixing prices which includes setting minimum wages is an injustice how is it different for fixing the currencyramadan is also about being pure and focusing on the more meaningful things in life opting out from the ungodly fiat system is a moral obligation on each one of us and we can’t do that without bitcoinramadan kareemfast and hodlthe bitcoin translatorthis is a guest post by bitcoin translator
