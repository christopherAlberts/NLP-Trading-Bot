the cryptocurrency crash has come in the backdrop of the chinese regulators announcing a crackdown on cryptocurrencies tuesdayrepresentationalat a time when investors around the world are scrambling to follow the newest financial trend that of bitcoin which is currently worth around  trillion very few are bothered about the carbon footprint that the cryptocurrency is leaving behindthe annual carbon footprint of bitcoins is almost equivalent to that of mumbai or to put it to a global perspective as high as the carbon footprint of slovakianewsletter  click to get the day’s best explainers in your inboxa recent study by alex de vries a dutch economist has shown that bitcoins leave behind a carbon footprint of  mt a year according to a study titled ‘ emissions from fuel combustion highlights ’ mumbai’s yearly carbon footprint stands at  mt while bangalore’s is at  mtvries has been able to create a bitcoin energy consumption index one of the first systematic attempts to estimate the energy use of the bitcoin network recently in an interview to the new york times microsoft cofounder bill gates had said that “bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind”relation between creating bitcoins and electricity requiredbitcoins are created by “mining” coins for which hightech computers are used for long hours to do complex calculations the more coins there are in the market the longer it takes to “mine” a new one and in the process more electricity is consumed as mining provides a solid source of revenue people are willing to run powerhungry machines for hours to get a piecein  the bitcoin network consumed  terawatt hours twh of electricity a year however now according to de vries’s estimates the network currently uses more than twice as much energy between  and  or about the same as norway as such each bitcoin transaction roughly requires an average  of carbon dioxide – which is equivalent to the carbon footprint produced by  credit cards swipedthe energy consumed by bitcoins annually compared to countries source bitcoin energy consumption index the energy consumed by bitcoins annually compared to countries source bitcoin energy consumption indexif bitcoin were a country it would consume more electricity than austria or bangladeshcalculating the carbon footprintthe major problem with mining bitcoin is not its massive energyconsumption nature it is the fact that most of the mining facilities are located in regions that rely heavily on coalbased powerearlier determining the carbon impact of the bitcoin network was difficult as tracking down miners was never easy however in  a study by garrick hileman and michel rauchs identified these facilities and calculated consumption of  megawatts a year as per the estimates of de vries roughly  of the costs of bitcoin mining is the price of the electricity used in january the price of a bitcoin stood at  and at this rate miners would be earning around  billion annually“with  of this income going to pay for electricity at a price of  per kwh  the total network could consume up to  per year” de vries wrote in his studythe paper cites an assumption of  of carbon dioxide produced for every kwh consumed that would mean a total energy consumption of  would result in a carbon footprint of  million metric tons of  which is roughly comparable to the carbon emissions produced by londonalso read  explained the rising popularity of blockchain artother impacts of bitcoin miningthe effects of cryptocurrency mining often spill over to other parts of the economy with miners using hightech computers for hours to formulate new blockchains these machines do not last long manufacturers of bitcoin mining devices need a substantial number of chips to produce these machines and recently during the  crisis the world had witnessed a shortage of these chips this shortage now in turn started affecting the production of electric vehicles around the worldto produce  million such computers the largest provider bitmain would have to use a month’s capacity of one of only two chip fabricators in the world capable of producing such highpower silicon – potentially crowding out demand from other sectors such as artificial intelligence transportation and home electronicsbesides this countries like iran are using cryptocurrency to circumvent economic sanctions that were imposed to prevent a nation from developing nuclear capabilities de vries writes that cheap energy has lured in many cryptocurrency miners and the mining activity in iran now represents  per cent of the total computational power in bitcoin’s network the country is thus using bitcoin to boost revenues while its oil exports suffer from international sanctionswhat can be done to control the carbon footprintgiven the growing implications of the cryptocurrency mining industry the dutch economist asks policymakers to follow the path shown by québec in canada where a moratorium on new mining operations has been imposed although bitcoin might be a decentralised currency many aspects of the ecosystem surrounding it are not largescale miners can easily be targeted with higher electricity rates moratoria or in the most extreme case confiscation of the equipment usedgovernments can also ban cryptocurrencies from digital asset marketplaces as it will affect the prices of a digital currencyindia and the cryptocurrencythe country at present has around  lakh cryptocurrency investors who have together pooled in over rs  crore into bitcoins and other such digital currencies the prices have surged by over  courtesy the worldwide boom – a single bitcoin that used to cost around rs  lakh in  now costs somewhere around rs  lakh nowhowever as per a recent reuters report government sources have said that the narendra modigovernment plans to pass the pending cryptocurrency bill that puts a complete ban on and criminalises possession of bitcoins finance minister nirmala sitharaman however has said that the centre will take a “calibrated approach” and leave a window open for experiments with blockchain technology
