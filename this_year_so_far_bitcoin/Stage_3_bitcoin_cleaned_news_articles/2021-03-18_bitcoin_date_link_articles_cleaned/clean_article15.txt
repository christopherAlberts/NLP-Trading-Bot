how bitcoin neutrality is simply another vote for a crumbling status quonearly ten years into failed fiscal and monetary policy experiments when trust in institutions is ebbing near an alltime low the rationale for holding bitcoin has never been stronger yet many people are neutral and nonreactive on the matter giving credence to the current state of affairs instead of challenging the very narrative that is gambling everyones’ future for small gains todaywith inflation historically behind the collapse of economic empires bitcoin offers a way outmany people point to the last financial crisis of  as the juncture where moral hazard reached a tipping pointfor those unfamiliar with the phrase moral hazard represents the idea that when an entity knows it will be protected against the risks it takes it will take outsized risks with the full knowledge that any failure will result in no meaningful consequencesinstead of punishing the instigators and culprits behind the last crash toobigtofail organizations and governments were propped up and bailed out by taxpayers unfortunately redrawing the boundaries of moral hazard didn’t create fewer risks but rather morein the time since interest rates around the globe have plunged to near or below  resulting in an ideology whereby money printing can solve any and every problem now with global debt totals hitting fresh new highs the printing press turning at full speed and inflation starting to run rampant it begs the question as to why the fiatfaithful and undecided remain just that instead of embracing bitcointhe repercussions of inflationary neutralitynot embracing bitcoin or choosing not to take a position on the matter is indeed a vote of confidence in the current system with an inflationary architecture in place and no plans to replace it the value of money declines with each passing dayprinting more money just accelerates this reality and zero interest rates are punishing savers like never before leaving money in the bank might as well be telegraphing to the world that confidence in its antiquated artifices is merited and deservedmortgaging people’s future to support failed policies in the present is a longterm losing strategy and history tells us that eventually the piper will be paid and the current debt supercycle will not last indefinitely there are countless current and past examples of these very events that underline how quickly a country can transition from a prosperous nation to a failed statewhether looking back at the weimar republic or currentday venezuela failed governmental and monetary policies eventually lead to hyperinflation rampant fiat currency devaluation combined with high debt levels are nearly insurmountable challenges that ultimately result in government and institutional failure cultivating a perfect foundation for autocracy and tyranny to flourishchallenging the fiat narrativebitcoin has already proven that another meaningful approach to this problem exists for today’s crumbling status quo as the best performing global asset over the last ten years by no less than a factor of ten the belief in decentralization continues to grow as institutional mistrust rises in parallelalthough there is no clear consensus on the total number of bitcoin holders given the difficulty in measuring participation some studies suggest that over  million people currently own bitcoin reflecting a share of around  of the total global populationthe exciting thing is that the momentum of this belief in bitcoin isn’t relegated to just one country or region but reflects a growing global community of people who believe that something better is both possible and realistic many people are voting with their feet and bitcoin wallet data reflects this accelerating trend into deflationary alternativesyounger generations are overrepresented in this respect which is hardly surprising given their firsthand experience witnessing the boombust bubble economy millennials for instance are three times more likely to own and hold bitcoin as longterm investments relative to any other generation generation z is also joining the wave of participation at a feverish pacebitcoin as a reflection of waning institutional trustwhether or not you believe in bitcoin or the promise that cryptocurrencies hold an insurance policy against bad governance and worse policies should not be underestimated and undervalued the main point of having bitcoin centers on where you stand on government and your remaining faith in these very institutions’ monetary systemsultimately ignorance of the institutional stranglehold on inflation and the consequences it transfers to ordinary people is very perilous this isn’t just a local notion either but a global reality accordingly not taking a stance on bitcoin is just as bad as avoiding it given it reflects unfettered belief and trust in the very systems that have wrought nothing but deterioration for most of society over the last decadetrust is ultimately earned not deserved by design trust isn’t needed to realize the benefits of bitcoin but faith in its abilities is undeniably rising putting the status quo on its back foot as new paradigms gain the confidence that people lack in government whether governments can rein in moral hazard is questionable but bitcoin holds the untold promise of faith in a system that requires absolutely none to exist and growso where does your faith lie – with current governmental monetary systems or with the promise of a decentralized one let us know in the
