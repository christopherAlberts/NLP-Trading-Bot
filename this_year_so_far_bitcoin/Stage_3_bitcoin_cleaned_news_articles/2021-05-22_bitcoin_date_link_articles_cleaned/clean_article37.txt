bitcoin may be suffering through a succession of negative news stories but some crypto investors are still celebrating major gains in ’s altcoin bull marketsince january  this year cointelegraph markets pro has been livetesting  separate automated strategies based on the proprietary vortecs™ algorithm developed in partnership with the tie a data analytics firmlet’s not be humble about this vortecs™ has crushed itof those  strategies every single one has beaten the return on investment roi delivered by bitcoin for hodlers who refuse to part with their btcand even when compared to holding an evenlyweighted basket of the top  altcoins  of those strategies come out aheadwhat’s more the most successful strategies — whether based on the time between an entry position and a hypothetical exit or exiting a position based on crossing a new score threshold — have delivered in excess of  returns as of may  — even after multiple pullbacks in the crypto asset class in fact the most successful of all buy   sell  has generated returns of that compares extremely favorably with the strategy of holding bitcoin  roi or the basket of altcoins  roi since january in the chart above which is based on exiting a position at an arbitrary time  hours  hours  hours or  hours all vortecs™ strategies beat bitcoin and only one failed to beat the altcoin basketin this second chart based on exiting at a second score threshold all vortecs™ strategies beat holding bitcoin and only four failed to beat the altcoin basketso what is vortecs™ — and why is it consistently outperforming the wider crypto marketwhat is vortecs™the vortecs™ score is an algorithmic metric derived from historical analysis of crypto marketsfor each one of the  crypto assets supported by cointelegraph markets pro the algorithm is hunting for moments in time that resemble the current marketscape —  hours a day  days a weekspecifically it’s looking for patterns that have consistently led to significant changes in price in the pastthose patterns include a variety of factors volume outlook realprice tweet volume elevation confidence and sentiment or vortecs™ for shortvolume a measure of how much of an asset is traded across supported exchangesoutlook a measure of whether the current market conditions are favorable or not compared with historicallysimilar conditionsrealprice a composite price derived from an average of prices across relevant exchanges discounting outliers based on low volumetweet volume a measure of the absolute and relative number of tweets about an asset over the past  hourselevation a measure of how far up or down an asset’s price moved following historicallysimilar market conditions to those observed currentlyconfidence the degree to which current conditions are similar to historic conditions with higher confidence also including the consistency of asset price moves following those conditionssentiment the positivity or negativity of the chatter on twitter surrounding the crypto asset derived from a complex proprietary algorithm developed by the tiethe algorithm combines all of this raw data into a vortecs™ score which is designed to identify the general health of the market for a particular crypto asset a high score suggests that in the past conditions similar to those we see right now have often led to increases in the price of that asset the higher the score the more confident the algorithm is that these scenarios have been consistentlike any trading algorithm that doesn’t mean it’s a crystal ball — in fact it’s almost exactly the opposite whereas fortune tellers look into the future vortecs™ looks into the pastbut it turns out that examining the right elements of history provides keen insights for crypto traders who are seeking an edgehow markets pro measures the vortecs™ score’s performancecointelegraph markets pro testing tracks the price of an asset when the score crosses a threshold for example a score of  and then measures the price again when it crosses a second threshold which could be another score or could be measured in hours the difference between the first and second prices is the gain or loss that the algorithm tracks… and there’s more detail on that hereso even though a human couldn’t trade exactly this way by applying a consistent set of standards it’s possible to establish whether an algorithm is operationally successful or not and the verdict is very clear vortecs™ has consistently and significantly outperformed the crypto market as a whole since livetesting began earlier this yearand perhaps just as importantly is the fact that even with a major pullback in the overall value of the crypto markets which lost close to a trillion dollars in value at the low point this week the performance of all the vortecs™ strategies tested continued to outperform the benchmark currency bitcoin by a significant marginusing the vortecs™ scoreremember the score is not a prediction of how an asset price will change over time but an analysis of how asset prices have changed over time when faced with similar market conditionsso the vortecs™ score while it is weighted to take account of the size of asset price change in the past will not tell you how much an asset may changeit will also not tell you when it will change — in fact the algorithm is deliberately fuzzy on time meaning that it is normalized and smoothed to ensure that abrupt outliers such as a sudden viral tweet don’t abnormally affect the overall trendwhile the algorithm is generally oriented to a  hour timeframe testing revealed that efforts to “time the market” precisely introduced an element that was not supported by historical dataso let’s take a look at an example score of this is a high score which means that there is some combination of these factorsthe algorithm has found market conditions in the past that look similar to current market conditionsthose historical conditions often led to an increase in asset price over the next  hours approximatelythe price changes in the past have been significantthe algorithm maintains a high level of confidence that the set of conditions it’s looking at are similar enough to suggest that the overall direction of this asset’s price is currently bullish or positivethe  crypto traders in the cointelegraph markets pro discord group which is available exclusively to members have used these scores in a wide variety of ways to enhance their understanding of the current market health for dozens of crypto assetsand while massive roi numbers like  are at the extremes of vortecs™ success it is worth noting that the mean roi from all scorebased strategies is  while the mean roi from all timebased strategies is  both of which are significantly higher than the benchmarks
