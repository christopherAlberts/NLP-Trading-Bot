and cons of central bank digital currenciesvan steenis is cleareyed about cbdcs arguing that they sometimes seem like a solution in search of a problem but he told insider they are definitely about central banks keeping control of moneya cbdc would be a digital version of banknotes and coins letting people hold and make payments in central bank money at the moment the digital money people use every day is created by commercial banks and held in accounts or on prepaid cardscentral bankers are watching cryptocurrencies closelysome analysts have argued that central banks have been spurred to action by the crypto boom and fears that bitcoin could become a global payments system bank of america researchers posited in march that cbdcs could be kryptonite for cryptovan steenis thinks differently approximately  of the money in most western markets is not actually central bank money but its money held in the bank in deposits in electronic format he says the world is already one in which  play a pivotal role but they dont dominatethe real issue is ensuring the stability of the financial system van steenis says and that means keeping an eye on cryptocurrenciesyet the crypto world is still tiny relative to the amount of money in bank deposits he says so i dont think theyre running scared on bitcoin but what they want to know is is there an innovation they need to adapt and borrow fromthe key concerns are dwindling cash use and techfirm dominancea major worry for central bankers is that as the use of cash dwindles private payment systems are becoming increasingly crucial and could shake the global financial system if they failif you think about the pandemic its probably fastforwarded the shift away from cash to digital by about three to five years van steenis says no central banker ever wants to feel they might lose control of their currencya cbdc would ensure everyone has access to a riskfree payment system proponents argue and would make transactions safer and more efficient just like going directly to the airline for your plane tickets online is faster and easier than going to see a travel agentmany central banks around the world are also asking themselves whether they want huge us technology companies like visa mastercard and paypal to dominate their national payments systems van steenis saysanother common argument is that western central banks are racing to keep up with chinas advanced cbdc project which they say could threaten the dollars dominancebut van steenis is skeptical i just dont see the geopolitical angle is whats driving it he says if you ask the swedes whats driving the ekrona its much more about a reduction in cash and inclusion and their responsibility to provide to society than it is because theyre trying to keep up with friends around the worldhuw van steenis pictured here in  has worked at the top of investment and central banks james boardmanreuterscbdcs could eat the banking sectors lunchwhatevers pushing it forward the creation of central bank digital currencies looks set to throw up a number of problems to accompany the benefitsone concern for bankers is that the technology might eat the financial sectors lunch the technical term is disintermediation  the idea that giving people access to cbdcs could stop them from needing banks at allvan steenis who knows wall street and the city well says cbdcs must be created with a twotier system in which people continue to hold accounts at banks and payment firmsyet he says there are other risks what happens when we think about money being moved from country a to country b do you then allow your monetary base to be sent to a foreign bank in which case how do you regulate them do you lose control of your monetary policycrypto community can innovate while central banks are cautiousthese sorts of issues mean central banks and the governments that ultimately control them will be very cautious about building cbdcs says van steenis countries will need to debate their pros and cons in a process that might take years he addedfed chair jerome powell said in march that the central bank would move with great care and transparency and wouldnt proceed without support from congressthat opens the door for others to innovate van steenis says not least those in the crypto world who are developing stablecoins and attractive financial networkshe says actually i think the crypto community does have a real window of opportunity to help define a future whilst the central banks are cautiously but studiously trying to progress what they do
