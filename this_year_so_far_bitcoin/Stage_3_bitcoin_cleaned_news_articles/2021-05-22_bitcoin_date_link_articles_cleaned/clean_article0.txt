fires the imagination like an anonymous hero with a secret identity it’s been an enduring trope since the scarlet pimpernel rescued his first aristocrat from madame la guillotine from batman to the street artist banksy each hero has his own reason for donning the mask of anonymitythis phenomenon has come to the world of finance in the person of satoshi nakamoto the socalled father of bitcoin he appeared out of the ether in  and disappeared just as abruptly three years later after establishing the world’s first cryptocurrency on april   he sent a farewell email to a fellow bitcoin developer “i’ve moved on to other things” he wrote assuring that the future of bitcoin was “in good hands” he has not been heard from sincetoday bitcoin is valued at more than  trillion and while nakamoto’s identity might be simply a matter of speculation for some it means far more to others he is said to own over  million bitcoins with a current value hovering somewhere around  billion that’s equivalent to about  percent of the total number of bitcoins currently in circulationshould the person—or persons—behind the name satoshi nakamoto decide to sell just some of this hoard the transaction would completely upend the cryptocurrency market cryptocurrency trading platform coinbase which went public on the nasdaq on april  noted the potential revelation of nakamoto’s identity and the movement of that person’s bitcoin holdings as a risk factor in its ipo filing with the securities and exchange commission sec coinbase even went so far as to send a copy of the filing to the last known email address for nakamotoincreasingly financial services behemoths like blackrock jpmorgan and bny mellon are offering cryptocurrencies and related services to their customers adding legitimacy to an asset that berkshire hathaway’s charlie munger once characterized as “contrary to the interests of civilization”bitcoin came to life when nakamoto published his famous white paper on a cryptography mailing list describing a digital currency that would allow secure peertopeer transactions without the involvement of any middleman whether that be the government financial system or a company these transactions would be tracked through a blockchain a ledger like those used by any financial institution except that this ledger would be distributed across an entire network with exact duplicates held by all participants and visible to all secured by cryptographic means there would never be more than  million bitcoinnakamoto created his cryptocurrency with the goal of wresting control of currency from financial elites and putting it in the hands of the common man the first bitcoin transaction occurred when nakamoto sent  bitcoins to hal finney a wellknown developer who had downloaded the bitcoin software on its release date the first commercial transaction came in  when a programmer named laszlo hanyecz bought himself two papa john’s pizzas for  bitcoin at bitcoin’s current price of nearly  those were some very expensive pizzasbitcoin is open source meaning its design is public no one person owns or controls bitcoin and anyone can participate while satoshi continued to control bitcoin’s development users and developers congregated in bitcoin forums to contribute code and work on the project which had become a collaborative effort the users running the bitcoin software were the ultimate authoritymany programmers and developers have written code for bitcoin but gavin andresen was one of the most enthusiastic he reached out to nakamoto in  and became the founder’s righthand man when nakamoto withdrew from sight he left bitcoin in andresen’s hands today even andresen himself has grown more reclusive he no longer serves as “core maintainer” of bitcoin’s code in fact that role may soon become as decentralized as the cryptocurrency itselfthroughout the history of bitcoin efforts to unveil nakamoto have continued unabated gossips in cryptocurrency forums have engaged in wild speculation nakamoto is a member of the yakuza part of a cabal of developers a moneylaunderer or maybe even a womanin  a reporter from newsweek identified  dorian nakamoto a softspoken resident of los angeles as bitcoin’s creator while his long and distinguished career in engineering was cited as evidence nakamoto has vehemently denied any involvement with the cryptocurrency the day after dorian nakamoto released a public statement satoshi surfaced in an online forum he posted “i am not dorian nakamoto” before vanishing once againaustralian craig wright claimed to be nakamoto in  and bitcoin developer andresen corroborated the statement saying he was “ percent sure” that wright was the elusive satoshi the cryptocurrency community wasn’t having it and wright backed away from the claimsuspicion also fell upon nick szabo a secretive crypto expert who contributed significantly to the development of bitcoin linguistic researchers analyzed szabo’s writing as well as writing from other suspected satoshis the linguists claimed that there were definitive similarities between szabo’s writings and satoshi nakamoto’s the new york times even went so far as to pin szabo as the shadowy nakamoto but szabo strenuously denied the claimsthe upshot is that satoshi nakamoto remains anonymous a mythical creature with a bitcoin stash of epic proportions he has strong incentives to remain anonymous owning a  billion fortune makes personal security a compelling concern given bitcoin’s potential to challenge sovereign fiat currencies nakomoto could fear potential legal actions by governments—if not other forms of government sanctionunquestionably efforts to uncover the identity of satoshi nakamoto will continue the threat he poses to the cryptocurrency market is too great and the mystery surrounding his identity is too compelling in a world where anonymity is increasingly difficult to pursue satoshi nakamoto has succeeded beyond imagination in keeping his secretsrebecca
