currently on the ethereum network eth  is on the way eth  is a longawaited upgrade to ethereum thats being rolled out in phases it promises to make ethereum more secure more scalable and more environmentally friendly the hope is that the move to a more sustainable model of mining will happen this yearcould ethereum surpass bitcointhats a good question after bitcoins extraordinary growth story everybodys looking for the next bitcoin and ethereum is a solid candidate ethereum is only six years old  bitcoin is now its not entirely fair to look at bitcoins price when it was at the same stage because the market has changed so much since then plus when bitcoin soars so does the rest of the market  including ethereum but back in  when bitcoin was also six years old it was worth around  ethereum is currently priced at over however in recent weeks bitcoin has been falling while ethereum has reached new highs thats because the market is starting to recognize that bitcoin and ethereum do very different thingsfirst mover bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that people are starting to see as a form of digital gold it is extremely secure but it cant do much more than it already does plus there are concerns about bitcoins carbon footprint  mining the coin currently uses as much energy as a large country like egyptin contrast ethereum still has room to grow were only just beginning to see the business applications of smart contracts and defi eth  will help the platform to meet increasing demand and move to a more sustainable mining modelthe bigger question is what will happen to the cryptocurrency industry as a whole these are highly volatile and unpredictable investments for every expert that predicts the price of ethereum or bitcoin will continue to rise theres another who says this is a bubble that could collapse completelythats why its advisable to only invest money you can afford to lose and to invest for the long term if you buy ethereum today and the market drops you want to be able to hold until the price rises again if youve tied up money you need to pay your rent or cover an unexpected emergency you might be forced to sell at a lossethereum may not be the next bitcoin but it may be a strong choice in its own right  it all depends on your personal investment goals and risk tolerance just remember a lot could happen especially if eth  doesnt deliver as expected or the us brings in strict cryptocurrency regulation
