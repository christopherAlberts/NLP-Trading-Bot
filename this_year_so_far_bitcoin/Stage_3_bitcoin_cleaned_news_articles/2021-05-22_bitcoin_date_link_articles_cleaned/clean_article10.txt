atul chatur cofounder antilles cryptocurrency ecosystem gives his views on investing in cryptocryptocurrency enthusiasts have faced a rather rough week with bitcoin ethereum and other cryptocurrencies dropping dramatically in value midweek but regaining some ground towards the end of the week those who had already invested in cryptocurrency chose a strategy to hodl – hold on for dear life – while others chose to “buy the dips” bitcoin’s volatility is not for the faint of heart from a peak of  a few weeks ago to a low of  this week before climbing back to cross  the blockchainbased virtual currency has had a wild ride however that’s something the swing isn’t something that bothers those who seriously track the marketfinancial express online spoke to atul chatur cofounder of antilles cryptocurrency ecosystem acex an expert in cryptocurrencies about the right strategy to invest in the cryptocurrency market as part of our series on decrypting cryptocurrenciesfe online what do you read into the way bitcoin has been behaving this week could you still call it a store of valueatul chatur i would want to start my insights based on a track record if you look at the historic returns of bitcoin and then look at a shorter timeframe in the last year  years from  till date bitcoin has given over  cagr so that’s an annual growth rate of  every year that’s from a longterm perspective if you look at the shortterm from last march compared to today it’s still at a  price which is about  there is nothing drastically wrong with it i don’t think we are into a bear market yet we are still in a bull market based on my own technical analysis plus what i am seeing in the investment world as well i think i think we are still in a bull market overall which will continue for some time also it’s very different from the last cycle where bitcoin was always a retail phenomenon in this cycle institutions are involved the moment institutions see a big opportunity in a dip like this i mean it’s almost  if bitcoin sort of rebounds from these levels you’re looking at at least a  return even from here so if you bought the dip if you bought in at about  or  and we get back to about  that’s like  in a week or two or three right these kinds of things have happened in the last cycle as well if you look at the chart for the last cycle they were about two  drops and about four  percent dips so crypto is volatile that’s a given i’m not too worried about this dipwatch the full videofe online is this a good time for those who haven’t gotten into crypto or are sitting on the fence to actually take the plunge and get into crypto nowatul chatur if you have a longterm view don’t be worried by long term i mean a fiveyear view if you had bought bitcoin five years back as i got in in  it’s not exactly five but four years i got in at  now i am sitting on easily a  rate of return if i look at  and i have sold at about  so if you’re looking at something like that i mean there’s a clear track record for you if you get in at these levels and in about five years you’re probably be sitting on at least  if not  returns i’m basing this both on the historical track record and also in terms of the wellknown supplydemand economics if i look at the supply it’s capped it’s reducing because  million bitcoins have already been mined there’s just about  million bitcoin that will be mined in the next  years there is going to be a massive supply crunch and then there is the fact that bitcoin is now really freely available for anyone to buy it’s on the square app it’s on venmo it’s on paypal visa has integrated into ethereum and on the blockchain as well there are just so many opportunities for people to buy worldwide retail is in obviously in a big way in this cycle but so are institutions which is where i think we’ll be lucky to see bitcoin at these levels in a month or two right now it is looking a bit weak i think the next one or two weeks will be crucial but after that i think it will bounce back in my view should one get in now i would think so but don’t get in with your full money i would deploy about  and see how it goes if you’ve got rs  to invest put in rs  right now and see how it goes because some weakness might persist over the next couple of weeksfe online it’s interesting that you mentioned putting in just  of the money right now in your view what should one’s investment portfolio look like if i had that rs  and i put  into crypto what should i be looking at – tokens bitcoin or ethereum and what should the rest of my portfolio consist of if i wanted a good investment portfolioatul chatur when i said  i assumed that you are going to put all of that money into crypto but if you have rs  rupees i would say your allocation should be only  into crypto especially for people who are looking at this as a pure investment as a pure asset class if you are invested in equities bonds gold and real estate and you want to look at crypto it is a risky and volatile asset class i don’t think the prices will dip that much in this cycle because of retail frenzy and a lot of retail buying options coinbase for example had an ipo in the us there are plenty of crypto exchanges out there and large institutions in spite of elon musk saying whatever he did tesla has not sold any of its bitcoin it did sell only  but that was just to test out the market so it doesn’t matter what people say they are not actually selling in a big way i mean whoever is selling is mostly retail individuals these are people who got in at   or  who are getting worried by thisif you’re looking at portfolio diversification and if you’re looking at getting exposure to an emerging technologybased asset class – just look at google or facebook about  years back i believe we have reached that stage because bitcoin is large enough ethereum is large enough if you had asked me about a year back i would have said take about  to  exposure right now i would say  this is just what i would do in terms of the coins that i like and the ones that i have done research on upfront i want to say this is not financial advice i want to be very clear on thatout of rs  that i would invest in crypto i would say  allocation to bitcoin  to ethereum and then the remaining  i would allocate to a bunch of altcoins now altcoins are probably even more volatile but there are a few that are on my radar and that i have invested in personally as well matic is one three of the founders are indian and one is now based out of europe it’s essentially an ethereum scaling solution they’ve got a few other services or offerings up their sleeve as well it’s doing really well and it has gone up about  in the last month or so another one i like is helium helium is one of the coins that has got a fundamental underlying business model they are growing very fast as well another one is rune which is also a zero to one project i would say among altcoins those are the three leading ones there’s a bunch of smaller ones but those are quite risky in the sense that they are really small i am dabbling in them myself but i don’t have large positionsfe online a disclaimer our readers should also do their own research before getting into cryptocurrency this is a risky market and you’re doing so at your own risk that said is crypto like a proxy for equities we are seeing a lot of firms coming up with their own tokens or their own coins is this kind of an unregulated proxy for equities in your viewatul chatur there are various kinds of coins or tokens i’ll just go over a couple of them let’s look at the top five coins so if you look at bitcoin it is a token if it’s used purely for payments it’s got limited use cases because it’s basically a store of value and you can use it for payments as well but the payment use case is limited because it’s very volatile in terms of price if i look at ethereum which is number two today that’s got many use cases it’s also used as apart from the store of value it’s used as a capital asset as well it’s also used as a “gas fee” mechanism if you build on top of the ethereum network it actually has its own programming language called solidity so if you build on top of the ethereum network for using that network you need to pay the gas fees or the fees if you may in the ethereum token it’s a multipurpose token as compared to what bitcoin isthen i go beyond that to a token called bnb which is the binance coin which is like a discount token if you went to the binance exchange and you trade let’s say bitcoin or ethereum or whatever else using the bnb token you get a certain discount because you are using that token and underlying that token is also the cash flows of binance for example binance uses  of its profits to burn the bnb tokens that’s like a deflationary policy it increases the price of the bnb tokenhelium for example is another one which is quite different it’s more of a reward token and you can mine with that as well there are  different kinds of tokens are these equity tokens no they aren’t equity shares give you ownership in the company equity shares are valued on the basis of priceearnings multiple for example you are comfortable buying an equity share that’s not true for tokens tokens are not used that way they do not give you any ownership in the underlying companythere are certain tokens called securities tokens it’s like an sto – securities token offering but there are very few of those stos have been looked at to see if they could help raise capital globally but there is no global capital raising jurisdiction as such even if it was a global company – amazon is in the us and infosys is in india you cannot have a global company listed that way there are certain stos that are equivalent to an equity sharefe online for investors getting into crypto there are clearly risks here but do you think if we had regulation in place already there would have seen such a kind of volatility in the crypto marketatul chatur if you look at the basic definition of crypto or bitcoin at a basic level it’s essentially electronic peertopeer cash without an intermediary this basically means i can send cash or a bitcoin from where i’m sitting to wherever you’re sitting whether it’s in bandra or whether it’s in new york in like two minutes and no one is involved in between i don’t need to take anyone’s permission now for an asset that is of this nature where it is basically electronic peertopeer cash without an intermediary how do you regulate such a market the only way to regulate this is when i use my inr my rupees to buy bitcoin for example one can regulate it by saying “you can’t buy more than rs  lakh worth of bitcoin” i mean that’s one sort of regulation that i see since i don’t need permission to trade assets i mean how do you stop it it’s not like a stock market where you can put a  circuit limit or a  circuit limit because there’s no intermediary in between to actually do that so volatility is actually a feature of the cryptocurrency market you have to realize it’s not a bug if you’re not comfortable with this concept of electronic peertopeer trading without an intermediary in a permissionless manner then regulations are not going to save you if you don’t like the feature don’t get involved in this market it can crash in a single day by  they can go up in a single day by  and there’s no one out there to say absolutely nothing shouldn’t happen that’s something that you have to realizethe suggestions and recommendations around
