bloombergbitcoin’s environmental dark side has been glossed over for years elon musk changed that with a tweetand with it the tesla inc chief executive officer threw open what some see as a new market opportunity for crypto “miners” brandishing their ecofriendly credentials some are working to sell what they are calling green bitcoin  coins whose transactions are verified on the blockchain by computers powered only by renewable energy the bet is that they will be able to command a premium of up to “there’s a market that doesn’t know it yet” said sheldon bennett ceo at crypto miner dmg blockchain solutions inc his firm has had discussions with “multiple banks and financial institutions” that want to buy bitcoins that can fulfill increasing demand for environmental social and corporate governance compliance he said “more and more they are saying if there’s an option i am willing to pay a premium to get it”the corporate world has increasingly focused on environmental concerns in recent years  or at least on appearing to care about green issues with the shift investors are hot to buy into renewable energy as the next big thing companies in every sector are pledging to cut their carbon emissions and the biden administration has set tough carbon goals and promised to fund new green technologieseven before musk helped to roil the crypto world with his tweet saying tesla would no longer accept bitcoin as payment industry participants have been moving to address the green backlash in addition to the mining pool focused on specifically using renewable energy dmg recently joined the crypto climate accord a privatesector initiative to decarbonize the crypto industry by  the group was inspired by the paris climate agreementthe idea of paying a premium for green bitcoin may not be such a stretch considering that coins that don’t use energyintensive mining  such as cardano and polkadot  actually enjoyed a short rally following musk’s comments when bitcoin tumbled the protocols they use to secure their networks and process transactions use less power than the system that supports bitcoina growing number of companies in the crypto industry are alert to the danger of being tagged as not green said isaac mazerothstein a research analyst at wood mackenzie “there are a bunch of miners who saw what happened with the coal industry” he said “so they only pursue a project if it’s carbon negative there are others who want to colocate with wind or with solar”miners’ willingness to shoulder potentially higher costs to go green may depend on bitcoin’s price of course when the going gets tough many green miners may be forced to change their game and go for lower cost and dirtier energy instead said christopher bendiksen head of research at coinshares a provider of digitalasset investment services“right now mining is hyper profitable” bendiksen said “and these hyper profitability periods don’t last forever when mining costs start approaching bitcoin price again the costs will matter bitcoin mining is absolutely ruthless and you are competing against miners that are in different countries than you are and they don’t necessarily care about the environment like you do it’s quite dangerous for your competitiveness over time”today only between  to  of total bitcoin mining is done using renewable energy bendiksen estimated about  of all bitcoin is being mined in china some of whose regions rely on cheap coal some of it is mined in kazakhstan and iran using dirty energy as wellironically some bitcoin miners that call themselves green have managed to get to a low energy cost that can help them survive downturns  by purchasing old coalburning power plants while designating themselves as green miners may raise some eyebrows the
