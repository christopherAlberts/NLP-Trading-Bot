this is part one of a multipart series that aims to answer the following question what is the “fundamental value” of bitcoin part one is about the value of scarcity part two — the market moves in bubbles part three — the rate of adoption and part four — the hash rate and the estimated price of bitcointhe value of scarcityin recent months — and throughout  amid the  pandemic and its negative effects on the economy — central banks around the world have issued unprecedented quantities of money in order to try to counter an inevitable economic crisis we live in a world where each generation of newly issued money printed by central banks leads to inflation or the reduction of the purchase value of the currency itself and consequently an increase in the price of goodsto give an example last year alone the amount of us dollars printed equals almost  of all dollars generated throughout time based on the registered value of the money supply of dollars in the world  in a single year is absurd only made possible by breaking the pact that obligates governments to keep the dollar quantity in circulation linked to the quantity of gold in the central bank’s vaults the famous  bretton woods pactconsequently the more dollars that are printed the more we can see their worth decreasing over time the opposite of inflation is deflation — in other words as time passes the more a currency appreciates and its purchasing power growsit is important to understand that bitcoin btc was designed to grow in value indefinitely i say this because the smallest quantity known as a satoshi is equal to  bitcoin it’s obvious that its creator imagined a deflationary system for his creation one that could help it reach everincreasing values in the moment that a satoshi has grown to be worth a us dollar a bitcoin will equal  this is the value that satoshi nakamoto had in mind for his own bitcoinnot immediately obviously and not even in the short term the path will likely be long and paved with several bubble bursts only the most courageous and tenacious who resist will succeed in the enterprise but alas this is the story of the financial marketswhy is it possible for bitcoin to reach this valuebecause there are  billion people in the world and there can only be  million bitcoin circulating at the end of its generation cycle as of  it is estimated that around  million people worldwide have more than a million dollars of wealth — do you think there is enough bitcoin for all these rich people many of them won’t be able to own a whole bitcoin because getting one will cost too much in a few years and because those who own them would never think about selling them this is the phenomenon of scarcitywhereas we are used to inflation or the increasing amount of money being printed by central banks this doesn’t exist in the crypto world in some cases there are special cryptocurrencies that are designed to decrease the number of tokens in circulation over timescarcity coupled with an increasing circulation of cryptocurrencies is the main reason why the price tends to rise and will continue to do so over time you understand now that owning an entire bitcoin will be a luxury that only a few people will be able to afford at most a few million people — given that the first million is rumored to be firmly deposited in satoshis walletsrelated  reasons why the top  richest bitcoin wallets still matter in this is the most concrete possibility we know of in terms of getting rich fast in a relatively short amount of years still for a small group of people the scenario of becoming millionaires thanks to cryptocurrencies about  in the world has already happenedscarcity and precious metalsthe concept of scarcity is well present and known in commodities such as with gold silver palladium or platinum these precious materials are all the more precious the more scarce their production is but is there a mathematical model that can estimate what the correct value of goods should be based on its scarcityif we think about phenomena such as ferrari rolex ancient paintings by famous painters etc all these assets are valued significantly higher than their cost of realization due to their scarcity — induced or generated — by those who created the assets themselves just like bitcoin in fact there is a mathematical model known as stocktoflow or sf that estimates price based on the quantity already present in the world stock with the quantity that is extracted every year flowthe smaller the quantity extracted every year the higher the value the precious metal has and since it takes many years to double the stock currently in circulation it itself has value because it is scarcein this table sf is measured as years required for the current stock to double as you can see gold is extracted at an amount of  per year compared with the current stock so its total value is greater than the other commoditiesthis relationship is more evident if the relationship between market value and supply growth is applied to a power diagram cartesian plane with both axes using a logarithmic scalefrom this graph you can clearly see that there is a power law governing the scarcity of goods along with their overall market value the power law is deduced by how linear the existing relationship manifests on a cartesian plane with both logarithmic axes as shown in the previous figuredoes this law also apply to bitcoin designed to have an everincreasing stocktoflow ratio ie an everdecreasing number of bitcoin mined over timefrom the graph it is clear that even bitcoin albeit with a different scale follows the same power lawthe three breaks in the graph represent the three halvings a phenomenon of halving mined bitcoin that occurs approximately every four years which makes bitcoin increasingly scarce compared with the stock in circulationfrom this graph we can see that the value of  trillion is anything but impossible to achieve and indeed it is only a matter of time — once the percentage of bitcoin mined in a single year will be equal to or less than  a situation that will occur at the next halving in this article was coauthored by ruggero bertelli and daniele
