commentary critics have long chastised cryptocurrencies for inordinate waste jack dorsey makes the argument that in fact bitcoin could drive renewable energyimage andriy onufriyenkomomentgetty imagesdespite dramatic swings in their value bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have never been more popular that may not be a good thing or perhaps it mightit depends on who you believea recent square white paper made the argument that bitcoin oft cast as a voracious consumer of coalpowered energy might actually become the central driver of green energy sources like wind and solar jack dorsey ceo of square and twitter seems to endorse that argument in his tweet on april   about that white paper bitcoin incentivizes renewable energyits a bold argument and one that bitcoin critic david gerard told the bbc amounts to a cynical exercise in bitcoin greenwashing if youre confused youre not alone tesla founder elon musk has been a big proponent and buyer of bitcoin but reversed course in a tweet on may   calling the energy consumption insane musk also suggested cryptocurrency has a promising future but this cannot come at great cost to the environment so who is right dorsey or musk the answer as ever is it dependssee cryptocurrency glossary from bitcoin and dogecoin to hot wallets and whales techrepublic premiummoney to burnin general companies seem to be trying to minimize their impact on the environment in tech the clouds and others have plans in place to reduce carbon output while shifting to renewable energy sources outside of tech the same is true of airlines like delta automotive manufacturers like ford and food companies like nestlé bitcoin the most wellknown of the cryptocurrencies however has traditionally gone the opposite direction that is to generate money in the land of bitcoin you must employ more hardware to spin more cpus gpus or asicsjust how much energy are we talking about by some estimates bitcoin mining consumes  twh terrawatt hours each year which equates to the energy consumption of several million us households or put another way bitcoin energy use in  equaled the total energy output of switzerland as reported by the bbc in that same article pwc analyst alex de vries explained that despite its tremendous consumption of energy bitcoin processes fewer than  million financial transactions per year if that sounds like a lot its not the traditional financial services industry handles  billion transactions each year in other words this is a lot of energy to benefit relatively few peoplemost of those transactions  according to a new study published in nature happen in china where twothirds of energy is coalpowered unfortunately the environmental problem with bitcoin stephen diehl wrote is intrinsicthe underlying technology of bitcoin is based on the notion of mining a technical term for a process that keeps the network running and processing transactions…he premise of bitcoin mining is to prove how much power you can waste and the more power you can waste the more tokens you can probabilistically secure in exchange for your energy waste and so people have set up entire warehouses of computer hardware dedicated to run  consuming power and performing the trial computations required by the protocol globally this consumes nation state levels of energy to keep it all runningthis paints a dire picture of the impact bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have on the planet but it also assumes no changes in how they source energy yet the crypto crowd has been looking for other ways to power their mining for example bitcoin sibling ethereum has touted plans to cut energy costs and miners have been looking to move to hydrorenewable power sources this is where dorsey and musk get involvedsee theres more to cryptocurrency than bitcoin  other digital coins to consider free pdf techrepublicdoes bitcoin incentivize renewable energywhile diehl argued that bitcoin is inherently wasteful dorsey turned this argument on its head in his tweet that bitcoin incentivizes renewable energy not long after dorseys tweet about squares paper on bitcoin tesla ceo and bitcoin buyer elon musk concurred with a oneword tweet truetrue — elon musk elonmusk april  if this seems counterintuitive lets start with the tldr offered by phil geiger in a january  medium post mining is about maximizing the number of hashes computations per kw of electricity currently the most efficient way to generate the highest hashesk is through the use of solar energy and hydroelectric because those are the cheapest ways to produce electricityof course this isnt inherently true coal or other fossil fuelbased energy can become cheaper energy sources through the normal ebb and flow of supply and demand and the bitcoin miners would shift to those sources because well profitaccording to the square white paper bitcoin is perfectly suited to the characteristics of renewable energy like solar and wind in part because of the nature of bitcoin miningbitcoin miners are unique energy buyers in that they offer highly flexible and easily interruptible load provide payout in a globally liquid cryptocurrency and are completely location agnostic requiring only an internet connection these combined qualities constitute an extraordinary asset an energy buyer of last resort that can be turned on or off at a moments notice anywhere in the worldthis flexibility is important because solar creates energy during the day and wind creates energy mostly at night doesnt match up to when people tend to consume the most energy when they get home from work and before bed while there are still energy storage and transmission issues to resolve the fact that miners dont need to operate at a particular period during the day means they can more easily tap into these renewable energy sourcesits an interesting argument and one that may or may not prove to be true in practice but given that cryptocurrencies dont seem to be going away anytime soon its hopeful that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will in fact find selfinterest in burning relatively clean energydisclosure i work for aws but the views expressed herein
