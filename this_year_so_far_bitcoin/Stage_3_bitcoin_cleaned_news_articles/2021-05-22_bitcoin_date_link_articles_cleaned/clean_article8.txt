the price of the worlds largest cryptocurrency bitcoin cryptobtc has dropped  from its alltime high as of this writing its trading hands at around  per token by contrast the stock market averages arent down anywhere near that much the nasdaq composite index is down roughly  and the sp  is down less than  nevertheless even though i own bitcoin personally in this article im going to argue that stocks are the better buy right nowthere are three reasons stocks are a better buy in my opinion and some of it has to do with the fundamental differences between stocks and cryptocurrencies high confidence in the future economythink about the economic development following innovations like the assembly line the space program and the smartphone consider that right now there are smart people planning a colony on mars developing quantum computers and building the worlds largest nuclearfusion plant with the iter project and theres a host of other things in development that sound like science fiction today if im making a bet im betting on technological advances like these that take our global economy to heights never seen beforethe global economy doesnt always expand there are recessions but im optimistic about the longterm future and stocks represent ownership stakes in realworld businesses as the economy grows many companies will capture this upside growing their revenue streams and rewarding their stakeholders with the profitsthis is how stocks work and its why im generally picking stocks over cryptocurrencies when presented with a binary choice im confident there will always be good businesses around therefore i enjoy finding them buying their stocks and holding them for as long as theyre still good businesses lower confidence in the future of cryptocurrencieson a small micronesian island theres a giant round stone standing  feet tall and weighing over  pounds to an outsider its just a rock to the islands original people its a rai stone  a locally agreedupon store of value the particular rock im referencing is just the largest of many used by the inhabitants of the yap islands of micronesia some stones are too big to move but thats ok for generations theyve kept mental track of financial transactions by exchanging partial or complete rai stonesfrom this illustration we see that currencies have value when we agree they have value for millennia humans have agreed gold has value but if you want to store value in a rai stone thats also acceptable in parts of micronesia in the same way if you want to use bitcoin as a store of value thats becoming an increasingly accepted practice worldwideaccording to a recent study by new york digital investment group  million people in the us now own some bitcoin and companies are starting to own some as well with tesla being a highprofile example in short theres growing consensus that bitcoin is an acceptable store of valuebut will there still be consensus that bitcoin is an acceptable store of value in five to ten years im less confident about that than i am about the future of the economy i own bitcoin because in my opinion its fame gives it the highest chance of achieving widespread acceptance among the cryptocurrencies that exist but i wouldnt stake my entire financial future on that belieftesla ceo elon musk recently called the environmental sustainability of bitcoin into question whether you agree with musk or not isnt the point the point is that factors like environmental impact speed of transactions or network security could cause people to eventually agree upon a different cryptocurrency as a better store of value i cant predict how bitcoin will be perceived in the future some stocks are down much more than bitcoinin the intro we noted that bitcoin is down more than the stock market averages which is true however some top stocks are down as much as or even more than bitcoin making these good buying opportunities for example three of my favorite stocks right now are airbnb peloton interactive and pinterest down   and  respectively from previous highs in fact considering how much its growing internationally i would put pinterest very high on a list of stocks to buy on the dipbut the reality is the choice is not binary  you can buy both stocks and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin on the dip for me i choose to put the majority of my investing dollars in stocks because i see what these companies are accomplishing in the real world but i also believe adoption for bitcoin is still growing making it worthy of a small longterm position as well
