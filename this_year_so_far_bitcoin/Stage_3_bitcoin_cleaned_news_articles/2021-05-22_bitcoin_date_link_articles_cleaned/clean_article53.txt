as the prices of cryptocurrencies are falling all of you might be wondering that should you buy the dip or hodl what you have it is really a difficult thing to answer but everything i say will be considered longterm for example bitcoin and ethereum both lost almost  of their value in the last week and on the other hand we have altcoins that have lost an even greater part of their value so all these coins seem to be a bargain if you have wanted to invest in something for some time now but considering the high volatility of the market right now it is best to wait it out for some timebuy the dip or hodlwe often consider buying the dip a tradition just like hodling but when you don’t know how deeper the dip might go play it safe people who are really sure about some coins can go ahead and invest  of their funds and keep the rest for future volatility do note that altcoins bleed more than bitcoin during volatile markets and therefore they are not a very safe investment if you have high hopes on some projects that could have the potential to scale up  in the future then yes go ahead bet on itdid you see how i used the word bet and not invest this is because other than bitcoin and ethereum i don’t think any particular coins have a  solid future ahead don’t invest in new projects and make sure that the founders of the coin are known it has been seen that many new coins emerge in the bull market and scam people as the bear market begins so stay away from projects that have been started recently no matter how promising it seems and if you really have to invest in the same don’t do more than is the bull market overno matter how numbers look i would say we are going  this year yeah i am still very bullish on bitcoin and this market cycle and if you are worried about your alts then wait for bitcoin to take off again it will carry everything along with it just remember that bitcoin is the king and its future will have an important role to play in the future of other coins in fact even in the last bull run there were over   corrections along the way and after that we saw  gains so it is probably the  major correction of this market and we could see many more in the future toowhat are your thoughts on the  correction that we saw recently do you think it is better to buy the dip now or just hodl let us know in the comments below also if you found our content informative do like it and share it with your friendsalso read paytm payments bank has stopped working with indian crypto exchanges
