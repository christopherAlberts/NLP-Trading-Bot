bitcoin has enjoyed a blistering rally since last fall but that ascent has also renewed attention on environmental social and governance concerns surrounding the world’s most popular cryptocurrencybitcoin’s latest rally to another alltime high north of  may have lost some steam this week but its blistering ascent since last year has reignited concerns about the toll bitcoin is taking on people and the planetin the united states president joe biden’s administration has voiced concerns over bitcoin’s role in money laundering the potential fallout of financial speculation and bitcoin’s environmental impactin china where more than half of new bitcoins are mined the vast amounts of energy required to do that are at odds with beijing’s climate goals prompting a crackdown by authoritiesunlike fiat currencies such as us dollars euros or yen bitcoin is not controlled by a government or central bank nor does it require a middleman to verify transactions it is by design decentralisedinstead of a bank transactions made with bitcoins are verified by a global decentralised network of computers aka mining rigs that race to verify blocks of transactions to add to bitcoin’s blockchain – a public ledger the winner is rewarded with new bitcoinsmining rigs are composed of very powerful computers sometimes thousands of them labouring in unison to solve complex math problems that requires a lot of energybitcoin proponents argue that it is being held to an unfair standard arguing that the vast financial systems that undergird fiat currencies consume far more resources than cryptocurrencies dobut that has not stopped some governments from taking action to rein in bitcoin’s carbon footprinta coalburning power plant can be seen behind a factory in the city

therethe massive autonomous area adjacent to the nation of mongolia fell short of the central government’s emissions targets in  prompting the region’s development commission to put the kibosh on cryptomining by the end of april  the move has reportedly driven miners to relocate their farms elsewhere in china where climatefriendly hydropower often dominatesmeanwhile chinese bitcoin miners have been seeking lower power costs and regulatory burdens moving even further afield to places like russia kazakhstan malaysia and iran — which are the biggest bitcoin mining countries after china and the

activity’though beijing’s official attitude towards the country’s bitcoin dominance is somewhat ambivalent in recent years it has intermittently cracked down on initial coin offerings for cryptocurrencies and on the exchanges that trade in themone activity officials are trying to rein in is capital flight china has strict capital controls but unregulated capital flight out of china via

which was the relatively stable cryptocurrency tetherstephen diehl a united kingdombased software engineer who researches bitcoin told al jazeera that people in china — whether engaged in gangrelated laundering of illegally earned money or simply seeking to dodge the limit of  renminbi  on currency outflows — can also get around the restrictions by converting cryptocurrencies into uk pounds or japanese yen that they can then freely take abroad“beijing has declared a lot of this as ‘undesirable activity’ and ‘unharmonious money’ in their official statements” said diehl of enforcement that combines antimoney laundering rules with general financial restrictions “and it’s really not in their geopolitical interest to let nationals move that much btc  out of the country”“it’s just kind of now reaching the price value where it’s becoming a bit of a thorn in their side” diehl added “thus the crackdown in  mongolia”chinese cryptocurrency exchanges such as binance huobi and mxc are often the provinces of money launderers according to a july  report by the financial action task force fatf – an intergovernmental body that works to promote standards against organised crime corruption and “terrorism”fatf helps to address the increasing risks posed by virtual assets which can include regulatory climate and reputational threatsnearly  percent of bitcoin mining globally is done in china’s

centre for alternative financexinjiang is where the united nations and other rights groups say more than one million minority uighur muslims have been held in internment camps the us and other governments have labelled china’s treatment of uighurs a genocide – a charge beijing denies claiming that the internment camps are vocational training centres to fight “extremism”tim swanson head of market intelligence for clearmatics a firm that designs protocols for decentralised finance points to another negative the amount of carbon produced by china’s cryptomining operations relative to the amount of economic growth they generate“coin miners have basically added a province’s worth of electricity consumption without adding a province’s worth of economic output so bitcoin mining is actually a net drag on the economy as a whole” swanson told al jazeera “and the profits of mining probably only accrue to a couple thousand people such as mining manufacturers mining farm operators and their stakeholders”swanson sees no benefits for china or other countries to incentivise any type of proofofwork mining — the form of digital currency creation that provides blockchain network security but requires huge energy inputs for the distributed consensusbased communitya leading alternative to proof of work pow mining is called “proof of stake” pos which has been successfully implemented in dozens of other blockchains“there is no need to burn or consume energy at the size or scale that proofofwork blockchains such as bitcoin do” said swanson “ethereum is trying to make that transition from pow to pos this year”‘orders of magnitude better’with a market capitalisation north of  ethereum is the secondlargest cryptocurrency nano a much smaller cryptocurrency with a market cap of roughly  already uses pos and relies on an algorithm named open representative votingnano’s backers argue that it is better for the environment and more ethically sound than bitcoin many of nano’s investors originally bought into bitcoin but were turned off by the high energy use pollution problems and moral quandary in china and other nondemocracies“centralisation in any geographic or political region is a concern” colin lemahieu nano’s founder told al jazeera “for a currency to be truly global no particular region should have control over it”nano hopes to supplant bitcoin as a more sustainable cryptocurrency through legislation regulation and climate advocacy but nano fans also know that mining cartels in china are wary of threats to bitcoin’s dominancesrikar srinivasula is

bitcoin transaction“i am very interested in the qualities that bitcoin has decentralisation selfsovereignty limited inflation censorship resistance peertopeer payments without middlemen” luberus told al jazeera “that is one of the reasons i started looking for alternatives that share and improve bitcoin’s core properties but without the massive energy footprint”“we already have bitcoin alternatives that are orders of magnitudes better in almost every way” he added “but many people don’t know about them”china for its part wants to focus on the rollout of its central bank digital currency the ecny which would give beijing more control over financial transactions fiscal taxation and political dissent meanwhile the us is nowhere close to issuing its own fiat digital currency but is keen to stop crypto from becoming a haven for money launderers
