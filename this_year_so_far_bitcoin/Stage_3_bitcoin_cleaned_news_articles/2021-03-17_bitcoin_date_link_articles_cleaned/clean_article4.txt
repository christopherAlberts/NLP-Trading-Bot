seems obvious right well there’s a common misconception among new crypto market participants that bitcoin is a company stock while its price activity can correlate with traditional markets on occasion it is in fact an entirely separate asset classbitcoin is a cryptocurrency – a type of digital asset secured by cryptography that can be used to make electronic payments over the internet or act as a store of value like gold or silverthink of cryptocurrencies as the emails of the currency world they do not exist in physical form they can be sent in minutes and they do not require multiple intermediaries to handle the paymentunlike fiat currencies like the us dollar or euro that store all card and wire transactions on a central ledger maintained by a single authority bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies use a technology called “blockchain” this is a globally distributed ledger that can be maintained and copied by anyone on the planet and ensures total immutability and transparencykey differences between bitcoin and stocksstockstraded on traditional stock exchanges such as nasdaq london stock exchange deutsche börse etccan only be traded monday to friday market opening and closing times vary between stock exchangesregulated financial productspurchasers receive share certificates to show legal proof of ownershipcompanies can produce new shares after publicly launching though there is a finite limitbrokerages maintain their own record of stock trades that they execute on behalf of clients in the united states this information is not publicly available unless an investor purchases over  of a listed companybitcointraded on centralized and decentralized crypto exchangescrypto markets do not close so bitcoin can be traded at any time on any daybitcoin is not a regulated investment vehicle however most international jurisdictions recognize it as propertypurchasers can hold their own bitcoin or delegate safe storage to thirdparty custodiansthere will only ever be  million bitcoins no new coins can be createdthe bitcoin blockchain publicly records all transactions and can be viewed or downloaded by anyone at any timecompany stocks that are tied to bitcoindespite the differences between these two investment options there are a number of publicly traded companies whose stocks are tied to the performance of bitcoin this is because the companies are either directly engaged in bitcoinrelated activities such as mining hold a substantial amount of bitcoin in reserves or their target market is crypto usersthese companies includesilvergate capitalmicrostrategysquareriot blockchainnvidiaargo blockchainmgt capital investmentsbitfarmsdiginexhut  miningvoyager digitalcanaan creativethis generally means that when bitcoin’s price is performing well these stocks also tend to perform well and vice versa recently jpmorgan launched a new financial product called the “cryptocurrency exposure basket” – a debt instrument linked to leading crypto focused companies that allows investors to gain indirect exposure to bitcoin and the altcoin marketstocks that trade closest to btcaccording to data from morningstar  was a record year for the world’s largest cryptocurrency in terms of its correlated performance to traditional equitiessubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policycorrelation is the measure of the relationship between two or more items in this case it’s used to measure the relationship between the price movements of two markets there are several methods to calculate correlation though the pearson productmoment correlation coefficient ppmcc is the preferred method for measuring similarities between different financial assets the ppmcc is measured between  and  the closer the value is to  the less correlated the two assets are the closer the value is to  the more correlated are the two assetsfor anyone interested to know how ppmcc is calculated here’s the equation ρxy ​ covxy  σx​σy​where ρxy  pearson productmoment correlation coefficientcovxy  covariance of variables x and yσx  standard deviation of xσy  standard deviation of y​the chart below illustrates a clear rise in correlation between bitcoin and a range of traditional financial markets including the sp  gold oil and us bondsthe highest correlation between bitcoin and the stock market is the sp  – an index of the largest  companies in the united states – with a value of  this is most likely due to a rise in institutional investment entering the crypto market and large players adding bitcoin to diversify their portfolios when either market rises or falls it presumably creates a knockon effect that spreads to other marketschart by morningstar showing bitcoin correlation to stocks and commodities source morningstarnasdaqvaneck
