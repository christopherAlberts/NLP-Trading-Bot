on the surface nothing too out of the ordinary happened on may   when a man in florida bought a couple of large pizzas from papa john’swhat was striking about the purchase wasn’t the pizzas though but the way in which the man paid for them he used what was then a new form of digital currency launched just the year before bitcoinin what is believed to be the first commercial transaction using the currency the man paid for the pizzas with  bitcoins at the time each bitcoin was worth less than a penny which means the man paid about  for the two pizzas today those  bitcoins would be worth considerably more roughly  millionsuch is the wild volatile world of bitcoin the most prominent of the cryptocurrencies an encrypted digital asset that typically is decentralized and outside of any central authority’s control just this year bitcoin more than doubled its value hitting the  mark in midmarchstories of the cryptocurrency’s latest surges and milestones seem to be a regular part of business news lately in february tesla announced it had bought  billion worth of bitcoin and planned to allow the cryptocurrency to be used for payment for its productsdespite the eyepopping news stories about bitcoin however it is far from universally accepted“it is a highly speculative asset” says john marthinsen a babson college professor of economics and international business and the distinguished chair in swiss economics “compare it to the dollar or yen or euro and it’s not really money we don’t value things in bitcoin not many stores accept it it’s very unstable”with bitcoin’s rise raising questions about its future marthinsen and other babson professors take a moment to offer insights about bitcoin the world of cryptocurrency and whether such volatile digital assets will ever be more than just an investmentdemand and volatilitycryptocurrencies arose out of the banking crisis of the great recession and the dissatisfaction with the traditional financial system that came in its wake says john edmunds a professor of finance and editor of the book rogue money and the underground economy an encyclopedia of alternative and cryptocurrencieson a recent podcast called pop goes the culture edmunds spoke of the fluctuations in value that are such an anxietyinducing hallmark of cryptocurrency “it’s hard to deal with the volatility” he says “they gyrate wildly” one cryptocurrency he was tracking went down  percent over the course of a week only to come roaring back  percent in one day “that’s just completely normal” edmunds says “if you’re new to the field you would think you had gotten on a roller coaster”for all its epic surges in value bitcoin also has seen precipitous declines during its history marthinsen has experienced many of those highs and lows having some years back bought a bitcoin which he still owns for a mere  “my only regret is that i bought only  worth of bitcoin at the time and not  worth” he saysmarthinsen says that most of bitcoin’s price volatility has been due to fluctuations in demand and that demand is fueled in myriad ways one source for instance may be investors from countries experiencing economic political or social disruptions who are looking for alternative places to put their moneyadditional demand may be caused by fomo or fear of missing out “as bitcoin’s price has increased and made millionaires out of the guy next door” marthinsen says “others have decided that they’d like to be millionaires too their interest has just perpetuated the increase in bitcoin demand” the current low interest rates also have people fishing about for higherperforming though riskier investmentssteven gordon professor of information systems at babson points out that demand for bitcoin is based almost entirely on what people perceive its future price will be “this makes it highly susceptible to market psychology which can be fickle” he saysmore than an investmentthis isn’t to say that the only use for bitcoin and cryptocurrency is for investors looking to make a payday cryptocurrency has many intriguing future uses say gordon and marthinsen immigrants sending money to their families in their home countries for example can cut out pricey middle men and just send cryptocurrency instead or women from patriarchal societies can conduct business in cryptocurrency as a way to circumnavigate cultural restrictionsin a recently published research paper in the quarterly review of economics and finance marthinsen and gordon examine how cryptocurrency can be utilized in a country suffering from hyperinflation faced with such a dire situation government leaders could adopt a new customized cryptocurrency one designed to help steer the country back to a more stable monetary environment say the authors“as bitcoin’s price has increased and made millionaires out of the guy next door others have decided that they’d like to be millionaires too their interest has just perpetuated the increase in bitcoin demand” professor john marthinsendespite all of the possibilities the future for cryptocurrencies and bitcoin in particular remains unclear “no one knows exactly where it’s going to go” gordon says bitcoin is certainly desirable as an investment and it can be a great way to diversify one’s portfolio because its value tends not to correlate to the stock marketbut could bitcoin become more than just an investment could it become a widely used currency one that you might employ to say buy coffee at the local convenience store both gordon and marthinsen are doubtful “it will never happen in my opinion” says gordon though he adds that the world of cryptocurrency is vast and that the future is unwritten “bitcoin doesn’t have the ability to scale to that level” gordon says “but other cryptocurrencies could”posted in research  insights
