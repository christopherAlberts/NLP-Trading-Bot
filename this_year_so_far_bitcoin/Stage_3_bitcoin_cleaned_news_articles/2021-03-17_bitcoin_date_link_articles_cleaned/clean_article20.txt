though the term “cult” has a negative connotation adherence to the bitcoin ideology is about changing the world for the betteraccording to tim draper an american venture capital investor netflix will be the next fortune  company to buy bitcoin moreover the billionaire believes that it’s only a matter of time before amazon has little option but to accept the cryptocurrency for payments this comes at a time when the likes of microstrategy and tesla are moving parts of their corporate treasuries into bitcoin paypal has been busy purchasing a technology firm called curv which engages in the secure storage of cryptocurrencies including bitcoinbut these institutions are only entering the game long after devoted believers laid the groundwork this is not a criticism it’s a fact after all bitcoin needs the likes of tesla and paypal to get involved otherwise any aspirations of becoming a global currency simply can’t be fully realized these huge companies give the crypto sector a seal of approval it desperately needs and it’s one of the reasons why bitcoin has become so incredibly successfulbut what are some of the other reasons for the cryptocurrency’s successit’s decentralized in nature it offers security and anonymity it’s free from third party interference etc what i am asking however is this what are the factors at a human level that make bitcoin so desirableand not just desirable but highly desirable in fact it’s no exaggeration to say that bitcoin has a cultlike following whythe word “cult” is most commonly used as a pejorative it conjures up images of chaos and despair names such as charles manson and reverend jim jones instantly spring to mind irrational and dangerous but one wonders can some cults be grounded in complete rationalitywhat is a cult it’s simply a deviant group which exists in a state of tension with societyacross the world there are thousands of cults some of them of course are very dangerous nevertheless as researchers at tennessee state university have noted “a cult is simply a group or movement held together by a shared commitment to a charismatic leader or ideology” it purports to have a “belief system that has the answers to all of life’s questions” furthermore cults tend to offer a novel “solution to be gained only by following the leader’s rules” lastly for a cult to be truly successful it “requires a high level of commitment from at least some of the members”manson had devoted followers many of them young women the ”manson girls” as they came to be known were willing to do almost anything for the leader ideological loyalty and commitment to the group’s philosophies were essential charles manson was clearly a dangerous criminal and his ideas were inherently racistwhat if another cult happens to have ideas that are both rational and economically sound and open to all people regardless of sexual orientation skin color etc what if the underlying ideology is in fact rooted in the idea of genuine unityin christian doctrine the trinity consists of the father son and holy spirit a unity of sorts three persons in one godheadthe doctrine of the trinity is “considered to be one of the central christian affirmations about god”cults also tend to have their own trinitylike doctrines first there’s differentiation second there’s the promotion of a lifestyle and third there is the promise of liberation from oppressive forcesbitcoin like apple and tesla is truly different although thousands of cryptocurrencies exist bitcoin is a blue whale in a sea of anchovies it was the world’s first ever cryptocurrency the world’s first ever “digital gold” again like apple and tesla as well as ikea and harley davidson bitcoin promotes a certain lifestyle one free from banking constraints and thirdparty intermediaries essentially it promotes a lifestyle based on a greater degree of financial autonomy lastly though it might sound extreme bitcoin does appear to offer genuine liberationcurrently around the world one billion people are either unbanked or underbanked bitcoin offers many of these people a credible alternative by allowing financial exchanges within an easilyaccessible network the need for centralized financial institutions disappears such a peertopeer electronic cash system decentralized in nature is designed with the people in mindcults consist of deviants people who wear the badge of nonconformity with a degree of honor considering the combined worth of all cryptocurrencies accounts for about  percent of the worlds money bitcoiners are most definitely deviants at least from a financial perspectivethough the term “cult” suggests something sinister context is incredibly important if the underlying ideology is based on sound principles then strict adherence to the ideology appears to be rational again the term “ideology” carries its own share of negative connotations for obvious historicallysignificant reasons yet the word merely denotes a system of ideas and ideals some ideas and ideals are abhorrent others meanwhile change the world for the betterbitcoin aims to do the latterthis is a guest post by j mac ghlionn opinions expressed
