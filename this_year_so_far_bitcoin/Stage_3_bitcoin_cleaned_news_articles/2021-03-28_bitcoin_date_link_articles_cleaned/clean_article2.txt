the cryptocurrency market has been abuzz as bitcoin gains popularity with investors reaching an alltime high of over  apiece in march in a commentary published on march   in the journal joule financial economist alex de vries quantifies how the surging bitcoin price is driving increasing energy consumption exacerbating the global shortage of chips and even threatening international safetytheoretically any computer with access to the internet and electricity can “mine” bitcoin a process to receive cryptocurrency by solving sophisticated mathematical equations it is estimated that all miners combined make over  quintillion — that is  zeros following  — attempts every second to solve the equation according to numbers from january   computational power and electricity cost become crucial to profiting from bitcoins“if you’re a bitcoin user making transactions you’re not the one directly paying for electricity it’s a bit of a hidden cost from a user perspective” says author alex de vries the founder of digiconomist digieconomist a blog that highlights new digital trends such as cryptocurrencythe hidden cost goes beyond energy consumption based on the bitcoin price in january de vries estimated that the entire bitcoin network could consume up to  twh per year close to the amount of energy all data centers consumed globally the consumed energy also results in  million metric tons of  comparable to the carbon footprint of metropolitan london“that’s a pretty mindblowing number” says de vries “those data centers serve most of global civilization and then there’s bitcoin which serves almost no one but still manages to consume about an equal amount of electricity”the market price of bitcoin is an incentive for miners to invest in hardware and electricity as the price rises more people put in orders to purchase and run the hardware causing an increase in energy consumption and vice versa when the price drops due to the overwhelming demand hardware manufacturers have reported that their devices are sold out and some customers may not receive their orders until later this suggests that the amount of energy consumption is “locked in” at the time of purchase“the price of bitcoin can crash by   and you may still end up at the same energy consumption point because of the lockin effect” says de vries “the whole idea of my article is to translate what the skyrocketing bitcoin price is going to mean not just for the environment but also externalities that go beyond that”bitcoin mining rigs’ short shelflife can mean a substantial amount of electronic waste in the coming years mining devices also exacerbate the current global chip shortage by competing for the same chips as personal electronics and electric vehicles which play an essential role in combatting climate change countries with inexpensive electricity such as iran can introduce new revenue streams though bitcoin mining“you can do a lot about these problems mining facilities are usually centralized they’re pretty easy to target” says de vries policymakers can intervene by raising electricity rates or confiscating mining equipment taxing bitcoin mining device manufacturers or limiting their access to chips are also strategies to consider although bitcoin is a decentralized currency government agencies can regulate exchange platforms and prevent its trading to influence the valuede vries notes that “we are limited to the information that we have today” and he cautions predictions for future trends regarding bitcoin “who knows what will happen in  maybe everyone is using bitcoin maybe nobody maybe everyone forgot about it could also be the case” he saysreference “bitcoin boom what rising prices mean for the network’s energy consumption” by alex de vries  march  jouledoi
