nothing is safe from cryptocurrency mining  not even  old tech youtuber stacksmashing via tweaktown has successfully repurposed his old game boy to mine bitcoin the mod wont turn you into a millionaire overnight but it does prove that you can teach an old dog new tricksfirst of all the modder used a standard usb flash card to load the his compiled roms onto the game boy if youre interested in the software aspect of the project the youtuber explains it pretty thoroughly in his videoan internet connection is one of the most basic requirements for mining cryptocurrencies since the game boy lacks wireless connectivity the handheld gaming console is unable to communicate with the bitcoin network without the help of a middle man thats where the  raspberry pi pico comes in to the rescuethe youtuber modified a nintendo game link cable to serve as the highway for communication the problem is that the voltage requirements for the raspberry pi pico and the nintendo game link cable are completely different the raspberry pi pico operates at  while the nintendo game link cable utilizes  logic levels as a result the modder implemented a simple fourchannel bidirectional logic shifter to do the voltage translationthe bidirectional functionality isnt necessary but its what the stacksmashing had at hand the final setup finds the game boy connected to the raspberry pi pico through the logic shifter with the pico attached to a pc which is where the internet connection comes fromthe game boy is equipped with an  sharp  processor clocked at  mhz the chip puts up a performance of approximately  hashes per second for comparison modern asic miners typically offer up to  terahashes per second therefore the game boy is only  trillion times slowerthe calculations reveal that it would only take a couple quadrillion years to eventually mine a single bitcoin on the bright side asic miners are powerhungry monsters while the game boy runs on four triplea batteries
