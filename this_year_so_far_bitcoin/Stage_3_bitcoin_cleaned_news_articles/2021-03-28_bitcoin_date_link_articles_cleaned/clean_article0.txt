bitcoin’s rollercoaster journey through march is drawing to a close with relative calm as the marketleading cryptocurrency appears to be consolidatingfollowing weeks of remarkable highs and mystifying dips bitcoin now looks to have settled above the  linea period of sideways movement could be just the tonic that traders have been clamouring for after repeated attempts to climb above  lost their grip since setting an alltimehigh of  more than two weeks agodespite taking the landmark figure with some conviction the high didn’t last long as the market became overheated and overstretched tumbling back to  a week of volatility chased the peak with further dips and fruitless liftsover the last week the narrative has been set to backdrop of uncertainty surrounding us bond yields and options closures looking like the teeth of bears which threatened to signal a sizeable correction for bitcoinsome commentators were even suggesting a massive drop was on the horizon while others had more conservative views that a quiet spell beckoned before the wave of institutional investment carried btc to new highsof particular interest to many longterm investors is the fact that this has been one of the first spells of weekend trading in months that hasn’t been wildly eventful on the few occasions where weekend trading has been flat it has often signalled a robust consolidation or even coiling prior to a significant rise in pricetoo much too soonone factor many observers have agreed upon with btc’s numerous and unsuccessful assaults to hold ground above  has been the issue of overstretching and the movement being too much too soonunder normal circumstances a sustained period of relatively horizontal trading heralds the return of confidence to an unsettled market however in the case of bitcoin it is likely that the bigger investors are anticipating an eventin mainstream stock markets a similar pattern to what is shaping up in the cryptocurrency charts often occurs while traders are waiting on certain pieces of information – such as an earnings report stock markets will also experience low trading volumes during this kind of sideways movementbitcoin’s trading volume – although often low over weekends – has been showing signs of erosion of late and seems to be echoing a stock market awaiting newsquite what that news might be is something of a mystery however it is likely that btc just needs a rest after a lot of activity and the crescendo of  options expiring on fridaythere was huge concern that the options expiry might send btc into a muchanticipated freefall and as yet no cracks appear to be showing on the surfaceinstead the market is looking relatively calm which as many experienced traders will be aware is often a signal in itself that something is looming on the horizonpast options expirations albeit none as sizeable as friday’s have largely been followed by a pump – something which seems to work against the current narrative of expecting a correctionkey moment coming upas always the volatility of cryptocurrencies mean it is almost impossible to decipher market intentions but there is a key moment coming up that should be watched very closelythe close of april will see another significant options expiry and it is shaping up to bigger than friday’s event interestingly many data collection sites are finding the majority of bets on bitcoin’s price high in april are centred around notably there are also a significant number of traders placing their expectation chips at  – twice as many it should be highlighted as those who are favouring the odds at considering the fact btc has ultimately failed to hold above  so far the level of confidence in  seems almost inconceivable however it is desperately hard to ignore the numbers
