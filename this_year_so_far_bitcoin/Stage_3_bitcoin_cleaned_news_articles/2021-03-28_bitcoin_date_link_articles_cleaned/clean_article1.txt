a combination of supply and demand dynamics and the actions of legacy financial systems will push bitcoin to  in bitcoin has been on a tear in  and if history is any indication we should expect bitcoin to continue to run well past the six figures mark and to  and beyond in the halving cycle dynamic programmatic price actionwhile the typical skeptic will shout from the rooftops “bitcoin is nothing more than a speculative bubble” and how there is “no intrinsic value bitcoin is just tulips” these critics clearly have not done much critical thinking or research on the topicto be fair to the naysayers on the surface it’s hard to understand how anything that has appreciated  percent over the past  days can have done so without being the beneficiary of mindless speculation or a bubble that is due to burst at any moment but the answer is simple supply is programmaticthe bitcoin protocol has programmatic supply issuance thus price is a function of increasing or diminishing demand to hold the asset there is no variability on the supply side this is a monumental breakthrough in monetary economics and is a concept that is ill understood even by socalled “economic experts”every  blocks or about every four years the bitcoin protocol undergoes what is called a “halving” where the new supply of bitcoin issued into circulation is reduced by  percent this event creates a disequilibrium in the supply and demand dynamics that the market had adjusted to during the previous  blockscheck out this thread by croesusbtc for a great visual on the dynamics of the halvingonce is chance twice is coincidence third times a patternwhile the halving events are known about into the future it is quite literally impossible to “price in a supply shock in regards to a monetary assetin march  plan b a pseudonymous twitter user released a model that quantified the relationship between the relative scarcity of bitcoin and the price interestingly enough he found there was quite a significant correlation between the stocktoflow ratio of bitcoin and the price action of the assetstock to flow can be quantified as existing supply of an assetcommodity divided by the annual flow of new supplyplan b later revised the model to account for presumably lost coins the updated model is shown below“all models are wrong but some are useful” george e p box british statisticianwhile it cannot be said that the price action is directly attributable to the halving and the stocktoflow relationship it is extremely obvious that this is simply not a statistical anomaly or occurring simply by chancethe model predicts a rise to  in  and in my opinion that is just the start as seen in previous halving cycles with the halving serving as a catalyst the price run up in bitcoin brings about a wave of new adopters and users who come to understand the monetary attributes of bitcoin this works in a reflexive cycle new adopters enter the space competing to acquire bitcoin which increases unit price which increases media attention and miner profitability which increases network security and gives the asset more perceived legitimacy this process has been occuring in a reflexive and cyclical fashion for over  years and it would be a bad choice to bet on it stopping anytime soonthe catalyst for  bitcoinwhat is fundamentally different during this halving cycle is the monetary debasement that is occuring in the legacy financial system major global central banks mainly the federal reserve and european central bank ecb have painted themselves into a corner following decades of interest rate reductions to stimulate markets rates are stuck at the zero lower bound leaving them without a major tool in their tool boxthe responsequantitative easing on a scale that was previously unfathomable shown by a parabolic rise in the balance sheets of the central banks without the ability to lower interest rates any further quantitative easing the act of buying bonds and securitized debt with newly “printed” cash has been the goto response this has provided a boon to global credit and stock markets and has served as absolute rocket fuel for the price of bitcoin recent statements from both the fed and ecb have shown that they are committed to continue easingwhat the rest of  has in storein the late months of  and the first months of  corporate and institutional interest in bitcoin as a monetary asset has exploded the insurance industry corporate treasurers wall street banks and sovereign wealth funds are all gearing up to enter the space in a big waythe bad news a vast majority of the  million bitcoin in circulation are not up for salethe good news a vast majority of the  million bitcoin in circulation are not up for salethis wave of new demand from large capital allocators will have to fit through a pinhole of available supply which will result in a skyrocketing bitcoin price as bitcoin undergoes the transition from a predominantly individualretaildriven asset into a global monetary asset with geopolitical implications a  bitcoin would equate to about a  trillion dollar asset still just a fraction of the current market value of gold its closest monetary competitorwhile nothing in this world is a guarantee it is quite a good bet to place that politicians and central bankers will continue to operate following their basic incentive of “printing money” as well as there being an extremely strong probability that the bitcoin network will continue to attract additional adopters as more rational individuals around the world come to realize that a system of rules is preferable to a system of rulers thus with all of these factors at play  bitcoin is not only in the cards but in my opinion it is highly likelyregardless of the what the price action of bitcoin brings in the coming months of  it is important to remember
