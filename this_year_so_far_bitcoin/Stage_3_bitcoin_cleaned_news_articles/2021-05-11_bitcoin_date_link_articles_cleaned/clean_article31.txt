hedge fund and forex titan stanley druckenmiller believes current federal reserve policy and us deficit spending are setting the us dollar on a path to collapse this morning he told cnbc’s joe kernen that it’s “more likely than not” the us dollar will lose its status as the global reserve currency within  years druckenmiller’s comments were focused on the fed’s commitment to low interest rates and us debt bond buybacks moves that ultimately support us deficit spending on coronavirus pandemic reliefdavid z morris is coindesks chief insights columnistdruckenmiller’s comments were positive for one group already effectively shorting the dollar cryptocurrency advocates with the euro a basket case and the chinese communist partybacked yuan still viewed with suspicion druckenmiller doesn’t see another fiat currency that can play the universal mediation role of the dollar anytime soon instead he thinks “the most likely replacement” for the dollar would be a “cryptoderived ledger system”this is a remarkable set of statements from druckenmiller considered by some to be the greatest foreign exchange trader in history he was the architect among other big trades of george soros’ legendary shorting of the british pound in  now he’s echoing one of the most fundamental talking points of bitcoin advocates who have for a decade contrasted the orange coin’s immutably fixed issuance with the propensity of states to let the money printer go brrrsubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policyinflation hasn’t been a major worry for the us economy for decades – in fact before the pandemic the fed regarded inflation as too low for nearly a decade but pandemic spending has pushed the us deficit and debt to record highs causing widespread concerns about inflation risk inflation can be a major headache for dollardenominated investors since it erodes their holdings and gains it can also be an annoyance for workers and consumers though wages tend to inflate along with pricesif the dollar becomes less attractive as a tool for foreign governments and global traders the unwinding of its global reserve status could be downright catastrophic for pretty much everyone in the us somewhere between  and  of all us banknotes are believed to be held abroad and dollars make up over  of national foreign exchange reserves worldwide according to the international monetary fund if faith erodes attempts to sell those positions could create a vicious downward cycle in the dollar’s value which would have an array of negative impacts at homedespite clear longerterm trends in us debt it’s far from clear that right now is really the time to rein in spending druckenmiller argues that the ongoing us recovery is so strong that further pandemic relief spending is unnecessary and even risky – but the relief spending appears to have been crucial to creating that recovery in the first place in fact some argue that the us response helped it “win the pandemic” by compensating for broad collapses in demand some also believe pandemic relief headed off economic damage on par with the great depression which could have damaged the dollar’s international standing as much as moderate inflation if not moredruckenmiller’s reserve currency endgame scenario shows one way that irresponsible government spending hurts everyone eventuallydruckenmiller doesn’t dispute the importance of relief spending instead more modestly arguing that it’s time to wind it down it’s a broadly keynesian argument grow the deficit while the private sector is down then scale back when the broader economy recovers it’s also arguably monday morning quarterbacking because current relief programs some set to last another six months were in the pipeline before the success of the us vaccine rollout was certain it’s even debatable on its current merits – the us real unemployment rate  is still above  for instance suggesting there’s plenty more slack in the overall economythat’s just one of the big disparities in what inflation means at different income levels as mentioned it’s investors and the wealthy who generally have the most to lose from inflation which eats into dollardenominated returns while also diluting the value of dollars held meanwhile it has been workers who are less likely to have significant savings or investments who saw the greatest proportional benefit from pandemic relief spending and who will suffer most when it ends druckenmiller’s reserve currency endgame scenario shows one way that irresponsible government spending hurts everyone eventually but in the short run pandemic relief has made a lot of regular people’s lives much better than they would have beenthis is almost never acknowledged in broader discussions of inflation but it’s clear to see if you contrast current inflation worries with responses to thenpresident donald trump’s  tax cut package the congressional budget office estimated those cuts which disproportionately benefited the rich would contribute  trillion to deficits over  years even accounting for added growth spurred by the cutsthat’s just as big a budget hole as president joe biden’s american rescue plan created but there was barely a peep about inflation following those tax cuts that’s even more remarkable because the cuts came during a period of economic strength that made them according to conventional thinking economically unnecessary and even more likely to be inflationary than spending during a slowdown even more puzzling many of the same people worried about pandemic inflation are simultaneously opposed to biden’s attempts to partially reverse the trump cutsthis all points to broader challenges that could come with any multinational reserve currency cryptoderived or otherwise while inflation is rightly feared deficit spending is an important tool for nationstates to meet local political and social needs particularly protecting the most vulnerable members of a society during crises in a worstcase scenario a global currency that totally usurps national currencies would limit a national government’s fiscal discretion to take these kinds of actions this can be seen in the problems nations like spain and greece have weathered after giving up their own currency to use the eurobut for nations that retain viable national currencies a supranational reserve currency might be more moderating than constraining particularly if it was accessible to the general public right now the main options if your own currency is being mismanaged are to look for other nations doing it better or to buy gold but a neutral antiinflationary reserve layer could be a much better refuge if it were easy to buy and hold for instance through a public blockchain distrust in a government’s fiscal policy would be quickly punished via falling currency demand meanwhile governments would still have the flexibility to issue debt denominated in their own currencies when it was truly needed and supported by public sentiment
