jamarlin martin jamarlin returns for a new season of the ghogh podcast to discuss bitcoin bubbles and biden he talks about the risk factors for bitcoin as an investment asset including origin risk speculative market structure regulatory and environment are broader financial markets in a massive speculative bubblethis is a full transcript of the conversation which has been lightly edited for clarityjamarlin martin peace welcome to the ghogh podcast with jamarlin martin ghogh as in go hard or go home let’s ghogh the title of this episode is “bitcoin bubbles and biden” bitcoin has been trading between  and  the past few weeks it’s up over  percent in one year and of course folks are getting really excited and the thesis is being sold that bitcoin of course is going to go to  and then possibly to  and then possibly to  millionthere’s a lot of bullishness out there there’s a lot of excitement and there’s also a lot of bubble thinking or speculative gambling thinking as if bitcoin is going to trade one way and it’s almost a guaranteed come up you’ve heard that saying when things look too easy there’s probably something wrong with it but right now in terms of the last year where an asset goes up  percent in  months this is a really good short term investment if you got in when bitcoin was trading about  and you rode it up to  to  that’s a really good short term returnthere’s this euphoria out there the focus of this podcast is not to tell you don’t go buy bitcoin or sell your bitcoin what i want to do is share the risk factors for bitcoin so maybe it could spark some curiosity in terms of the other side that you can hold on or be a bull for bitcoin but it’s important for us to understand the other side and of course it’s important to understand the risk factor so if folks are going to invest or hold bitcoin at around  it would be beneficial to understand the different factors that can send it back down to  or lower i’m not trying to turn you against bitcoin i want to be clear i just want to share the risk factors the other side that the media and a lot of the pumpers the brokers the people conflicted in the industry that’s holding bitcoin they want to get the grandma into bitcoin they want to get the kids they want to get everybody into bitcoin because their own position goes up their narrative is going to be very onesided they’re going to be selling bitcoin as if it’s pure that it doesn’t have any defects or flaws or risk factorsof course with any bubble you have a lot of charlatans and the greed factor kicks in where folks are selling stuff without giving you all the information and so they’re not really selling it in good faith they’re just pumping pumping pumping bitcoin’s going to go to the moon bitcoin’s going to the moon but we’re going to get into this but often the little person at the end of the bubble when the little person i’m talking about relative income folks who don’t have a lot of money to lose but when the little person the retail buyer starts to get in at the end of a bubble cycle they tend to get hurt they tend to get crushed of course the rug is pulled in all these people in the industry the media the brokers the investment funds they’re all pumping it but when the rug is pulled a lot of people get hurt after a bubbleso we’re going to go through the risk factors the first risk factor for bitcoin from my perspective is what i would call origin risk who created bitcoin essentially no one knows so when you’re thinking about bitcoin as an asset i would call it an x asset it’s unknown and so no one knows the identity of the person or people who created bitcoin now there are some suspicions out there that it was created by the us government it was created by an agency like the nsa the founder of ethereum essentially said he thought that bitcoin could have been created by the nsa he says that things as big as governments work against themselves all the time i wouldn’t be too surprised if the nsa has some part in at least supporting it and so of course the pumpers and the cheerleaders of bitcoin they act like this is a people thing the people created bitcoin and it’s for the people to go against the government so they want to frame bitcoin as it’s like a populous thing you’re banging on the government bitcoin against the government you hear this populous it’s gonna help these countries and help poor people and it’s going to do all this populous stuff and so they think that bitcoin is taking over and rising and the government is asleep the government don’t know where it came from – jamarlin martin so i think it’s intelligent to consider that you have not outsmarted the us government there’s a reasonable probability that the us government knows where bitcoin came from and they may have been involved with it and so obviously they’re not going to tell you that they’re not going to tell us that but when there is an asset that’s rising to a trillion dollars market cap and it’s blowing up it’s making it easier for folks to hide gray or dirty money i wouldn’t assume that the government doesn’t know the origin of bitcoin or is not involved in bitcoin so the one risk factor in terms of the asset is we don’t know where bitcoin came from we don’t know who created it now the ceo of russian cybersecurity company kaspersky lab he also suggested that it could have been the american intelligence agencies creating bitcoin to help process funding to other intelligence agencies without of course being detectedit’s not a radical view that the us government could have created bitcoin so this is why coinbase which is about to ipo near a  billion one of the leading crypto exchanges this is why they came out and said that one of the risk factors in their ipo prospectus their  is that if the identity if someone was able to break that big story or that big information if somebody came out and said “i know who created bitcoin” if someone was able to identify that actor or actors that could pose a risk to that thesis because of course everyone is leveraged to one side thinking that “oh it’s this great thing that’s going to take over the world and it’s for the people and it’s against the government and you’re going to be able to have freedom” so if the identity becomes known and it conflicts with the popular narrative of all the cheerleaders and the pumpers where it’s easier if it’s a spook it’s easier if no one knows where it came from but if the identity is becomes known later that could crush the price of bitcoin because it would just disrupt the story it would disrupt the bitcoin religion that people are evangelizing so the first risk factor is origin riskthe second risk factor is what i would call a speculative market structure essentially bitcoin could be a promising asset it could have strong fundamentals it could be a really good investment however based on the investment flows the speculative investment flows that come in the hot money the quick money people wanting to make a quick buck like a casino if there’s a lot of speculative fast money coming in and that fast casino money where want to make a lot of money in a short amount of time if that money comes in then the market structure could be dominated by folks who don’t really have conviction they’re just in for a quick buck right it’s a lot of hot money and they have to make the money fast essentially they’re coming in to make a killing fast so if the speculative money who don’t really look at bitcoin like hey i’m holding it like a warren buffet or a longterm investor because i believe in it and i’m going to hold her for  or  years that’s holding bitcoin with strong hands with a lot of conviction – jamarlin martin the opposite of that is a lot of flow is coming in just to go into the next hot thing to make a quick buck so if the speculative casino gambling type of character becomes a dominant supportive factor for bitcoin that’s a risk factor because if the market starts to turn this hot money is going to be rushing for the exit they’re going to try to all be getting out the door at the same time so this could set up a collapse of bitcoin of  percent or more and essentially bitcoin being cut in half or something more severe and it stays there for a couple of years if you’re holding bitcoin for the long term you have a lot of conviction that’s fine but if this hot money speculative money this more casino quick buck money is really really deep in the market structure of bitcoin it’s a risk to that asset and so of course you saw a lot of speculative activity with tech stocks in  before the crash you saw a lot of speculative activity with real estate bitcoin is not an exception okay so this market structure that’s underneath bitcoin it’s creating a big risk for a lot of people getting hurt trying to run out that door at the same time once they see this thing is falling    percent there’s speculative market structure riskso the third risk factor with bitcoin would be regulatory risks you may have seen the lawsuit by the sec the securities and exchange commission where they sued ripple labs who are the originators of the crypto xrp ripple is doing all this funny stuff they’re going into the market manipulating their own xrp coin they’re signing deals and they’re not disclosing to the xrp folks that they are buying marketing partnerships so they’ll announce a deal with moneygram but they may have sent moneygram  million or  million and to ripple  million to  million to pay the partner to try their platform that’s nothing because when the bubble heads see the press release they’re going to buy if they’re buying the market cap of xrp could go up  million there’s a lot of this pump activity or nefarious activity like with any bubble where you have so much money in play you have something new you have something hot there’s a lot of nefarious actors a lot of greedy actors that bring this fraud element to it or misrepresentations where they’re trying to get the people hooked into the new thingof course in the  real estate bubble and crash you had the fraud element there and so the fraud is in the crypto and the bitcoin ecosystem too you have a lot of money you have a lot of dirty players in the marketplace but essentially the bitcoin and crypto coins they could be used for tax avoidance in switzerland they used to have a bank secrecy laws where they weren’t allowed to reveal client names to the irs or to foreign governments they were real tight on that but that was busted up okay so in switzerland it’s not easy to hide gray or dirty money in switzerland anymore so essentially folks are going to be looking for tax avoidance or tax fraud so essentially that one loophole closes folks will be looking for other loopholes so in jurisdictions not just in switzerland a lot of the tax loopholes that were used have closed and are closing and so essentially you would have you can expect that there’s more real flows of money of dirty and gray money looking to avoid taxes that flows into cryptoif you have fraud if you have tax avoidance that could bring in the regulators in terms of we need to know what’s going on if you have regulation that’s coming it’s not whether it’s going to come it’s essentially how is it going to come the regulations are coming to bitcoin and the crypto complex the regulatory risks not just in the united states but around the world for example india is talking about new regulations or possibly banning bitcoin these regulations could impact the price where the government comes in and wants to know everything or restricts it ray dalio the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund bridgewater he said that it’s likely that the us government is going to ban bitcoin so that’s a risk factor to the bitcoin investment asset essentially you could have very harsh regulations come down that could really send this bubble in a spiral it could be gradual regulations but essentially i believe it’s one of the important risk factors to understand – jamarlin martin so the other risk factor number four we have environmental risk i don’t have a directional position on bitcoin is bad for the environment that means bitcoin is this i don’t have a directional point of view in terms of the environmental risk what i could say is that there’s very smart people who are looking at this there’s very powerful people influential people who are now looking at the environmental risk of bitcoin essentiallyd the structure of bitcoin is that it’s mined through a computer processing power so essentially you yourself can use your computer or use computers to mine bitcoin you may not be able to mind much but folks are building mining centers with hundreds and thousands of machines to mine bitcoin to make money like you would mine for gold and so when you’re running all these computers in these centers essentially burning energy it’s a lot of processing power that’s used to mine bitcoin one report says that bitcoin consumes more electricity than argentina another report has the government in iran blaming bitcoin for massive blackouts meaning its pressure on their grid and so when folks are debating on twitter or youtube or whatever they’re going back and forth and the bitcoin pumpers will say “oh a lot of things use electricity so it’s no big deal”you don’t have to really engage in the debates you listen or whatever but to weed out the noise and the biases obviously some of these people on both sides the person attacking bitcoin they may have a conflicted interest they may want clicks or something like that or they may want some type of media attention in attacking bitcoin they may be mad that they didn’t catch the bitcoin bull market but on the other side you have the pumpers and the cheerleaders who own bitcoin so the mentality of someone who’s conflicted particularly conflicted with size in terms of a meaningful part of their wealth is invested in bitcoin that mind it could be so conflicted where they don’t care about the environment so they’re not going to be thinking about hey let’s play this out where bitcoin could really become a problem for certain countries with weaker resources for electricity or it could just be a problem for the planet as a whole so in china they shut down some bitcoin mining in certain areas and one of the factors was a concern with the the weight on electricity there’s a lot of debating in terms of the impact of bitcoin on the environment but one thing you can look at is look in the world world in terms of what’s happening and how governments and local communities they have to respond to something that’s real when you want to get out of ideology and go into the actual facts where why are these governments shutting down these mining centers and what are they saying about the electricity weight of these bitcoin mining farms if the world was to take a net negative position that bitcoin in aggregate in terms of the whole ecosystem is harmful to the environment that could cause downside pressure on the bitcoin pricethis is factor five now we started with origin risk speculative market structure risk regulatory risk number three environmental risk number four so number five is crypto inflation what is crypto inflation it’s essentially just like if a government zimbabwe or venezuela they may lose control and the currency is not worth anything they’ve printed so much crypto inflation there’s new crypto coins being printed every day okay so the market’s hot and you have new coins being produced new coins that may have better security are superior features than bitcoin and so these new cryptos are being produced in it’s a form of competition and also increased supply so if you have crypto coins being created every single day and you have people buying these new coins there’s so much crypto supply in the marketplace that could devalue bitcoin and other coins because there’s so many different options there are so many different cryptos – jamarlin martin and so the bitcoiners will say hey one of the big fundamental factors for bitcoin is that you can’t print a lot of it there’s a limited supply that’s true however it could be impacted by the supply of the whole crypto complex so if you just have nonstop printing and printing of cryptos with new features really good features whatever it’s the hot thing it’s going up more than bitcoin you could have crypto inflation okay and that could impact i believe the price of bitcoin right now of course everything is going up together bitcoin goes up dodge coin goes up bitcoin goes up they have a new coin coming out called the leprechaun coin most likely that’s going to go up so all the cryptos are moving together right now but that dynamic could change over time keep an eye out on just nonstop production of more and more coins that could be a risk factor for bitcoin itself and the scarcity argumentthe number six would be volatility risk so the bitcoin cheerleaders and pumpers some of the real bitcoin evangelicals the real fanatical bitcoin rideordie folks some of them will say bitcoin the kid in nigeria or hanoi in vietnam bitcoin allows them to transact easily when there could be problems with the currency or transacting in their local currency so there’s a problem with that so bitcoin is helping save the world and it’s helping the people so if i’m in nigeria or vietnam and i get paid in bitcoin and bitcoin is getting knocked   percent or it could be down  percent in a week right i may not want to get paid in bitcoin because the value of my labor or my services it’s too volatile i can’t work and build up this value and then it could collapse  percent i worked for a certain amount so if bitcoin is moving around like crazy it’s fine if it’s just going up but we know that bitcoin is just not going to go up crazy  percent  percent  percent every year so if people are getting paid with an asset or a currency that’s going up like crazy fine in a bubble market fine i’ll get paid in that it just keeps on going up and up but at the end of the day this is not going to last forever so the idea that bitcoin is going to be used as a real currency where you buy things with it you buy the candy bar you buy the loaf of bread you pay for services with bitcoin the volatility would have to come down significantly so essentially bitcoin is moving around too much for businesses and people to transact with it at scale over the longterm so the bitcoin cheerleader could could say and i would agree with them that it is possible that the volatility goes down over the longterm give bitcoin a chance it’s still a little kid and the volatility would go down over the longterm that is a possibility there but essentially there’s volatility risk and this volatility risk is important and related to the next point – jamarlin martin so number point number seven would be a shift from speculation from fundamentals the bitcoin bulls when things started they would talk about the fundamentals they would talk about using it in the real economy solving real problems there’s going to be adoption where you use bitcoin like you use the dollar like you use the japanese yen so you would use it in the real economy every day that was a signature piece of the thesis but like ripple and xrp in terms of the sec complaint that i read the bitcoin cheerleaders and pumpers they don’t talk about the fundamentals anymore you know what they talk about they talk about hey jack dorsey’s buying bitcoin michael saylor the ceo of microstrategy is buying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin his original company product and thesis has nothing to do with bitcoin but essentially he wants to speculate and use the company to buy bitcoin so michael saylor announces he’s buying bitcoin the price of bitcoin goes up jack dorsey says this about bitcoin it’s going up elon musk says this about bitcoin it’s going up so this pumper mentality where the price of bitcoin is very sensitive to folks buying the asset but essentially no one is talking about the realworld adoption the fundamental case of bitcoin in terms of turning into something that could compete with the dollar or the japanese yen so the narrative has changed with the bitcoin crowd with a significant piece of the bitcoin crowd where essentially it’s all about institutions goldman sachs or fidelity or it’s all about who’s buying what institutions are adopting it as a speculative investment asset they’re not talking about ontheground adoption and use of bitcoin in the real world as a real currency so you see this shift and so when you see the aggressive shift in terms of the thesis like that you have to start asking questions about why has it been such a shiftin terms of price if something is going to go up to a million dollars you would prefer that the fundamentals around realworld adoption consumer and business adoption in terms of using bitcoin that that’s really the big piece of the story when the big piece of the story just comes to who’s buying and you know how much the price is moving you get more into this speculative realm you get more into the casino fast money realm a risk factor for bitcoin is essentially no one is talking about things outside of price and who’s buying what celebrity what entrepreneur what investor what institution is buying bitcoin or starting to believe in bitcoin they want to make money right the more speculative stuff that you have in the narrative of bitcoin the bigger the risk so i want to know that shift from realworld fundamentals realworld currency to speculation who’s pumping who’s buying what institution is investingi want to move on to the next b which is bubble and i’m going to keep this one pretty short but i want to talk about joseph kennedy the father of the american president jfk jr so in  he was a big wall street investor and he went to go get his shoes shined and the shoeshine boy started talking to him about stocks stock tips and joseph kennedy said “hey in terms of market cycles and how this thing works the shoeshine boy is giving me joseph kennedy tips and i have insider information i know the banks i know the major players if the shoeshine boy is really getting into the stock market it’s probably towards the end of the cycle it’s probably going to crash pretty soon i don’t know when it’s going to crash but probably odds are in favor that when the shoeshine boy starts to get excited about the market this bubble is going to turn right this bull market is about to turn just in terms of the psychology and nature of the markets i thought about this i read so many headlines about kids trading and there’s parents on twitter bragging about their kids trading and you have entrepreneurs bragging about they made some money on tesla this and that and they’re riding and getting into this bubble and this bubble is running real hot right – jamarlin martin and so i know folks who want to become traders now friends and family members who weren’t in the markets but they see the bubble and the returns and they want to become traders there’s nothing wrong with kids wanting to learn about markets or investing from my point of view however if you’re going to introduce kids or your family and friends or yourself if you get introduced to the markets in a bubble that’s running real hot running very speculative casinolike with outrageous returns your introduction to it may become a problem later where you get in at the top of a bubble where valuations they don’t matter cash profits real stuff it’s not going to go up like fake stuff the less revenue the less profits the less cash you have the more debt you have the higher the returns in a really really sick bubble that we’re in now it’s the opposite of what you should have essentially the investor wants that  percent  percent return in a year and so the money starts to go to really hot stuff that’s very speculative that doesn’t have a lot of substance underneath it yet folks are taking more and more risks so if you come into this type of risk environment where things seem easy and they’re very bubbly when the market turns it could turn the people off because they didn’t really learn the fundamentals of investing that markets are not really one way they just got in towards the end of a massive bubble and so after each crash people are turned off people lose a lot of money people don’t like the markets because they got really excited they may have leveraged up and then crash hits him it’s like a shock to them that the market crashesjamarlin martin so the people never really learn the fundamentals of investing they learn the fundamentals of trading and most likely getting lucky towards the end of a bubble but when we’re learning things what i would say is that when you’re learning something it’s ideal to learn it in a way where it can scale kids trading and all this stuff that’s going on it’s not going to be sustainable this stuff is going to end really really bad i want to reference of course joseph kennedy just in terms of market cycles we know that markets go in cycles right and then there’s a party and then that party ends and usually when that party ends it’s breaking up the police and the fire department are coming in it’s nasty people lose a lot of money at the end of these bubbles you have people at the end of the cycles you have people like joseph kennedy who will see the psychology change and see that these hollywood celebrities or rappers and the kids they’re all getting into the bubble right they’ll see this and they’ve been around the block they’ve seen a lot of different bubbles they’ve studied bubbles they’ve lost money in bubbles so they have deep experience so they’ll see this stuff going on and they’ll see the valuations where people don’t care about valuations and cash anymore they don’t care about fundamentals they’ll see all this stuff going on and they’ll say “okay we’re going to start lightening up our positions this looks like we’re towards the end of the cycle” and so when these big wallets and institutions when they start thinking like joseph kennedy in terms of this bubble’s out of control they can start putting weight on the market essentially starting to sell down not selling their whole portfolio but move into more conservative names more cash generative names more proven names and so they can start what they call distribution – jamarlin martin they could start shifting their portfolio to more conservative stocks and investments or just a more conservative posture or let’s say a less speculative posture are less speculative orientation or in joseph kennedy’s case he flipped and shorted and him and his clique in terms of i’ve got to think at that time investing was more collusive where folks worked together they shared information particularly the people at the top so when joseph kennedy starts to back out of that market in  him and his network his elite network they could have put pressure in terms of contributing to the conditions of the crash meaning they’re putting weight on the crash because before the crash happens they start to sell joseph kennedy the record shows that he actually bet against the market and made money when that bubble popped you have to be thinking that when people see all this craziness they have these nfts nonfungible tokens here’s the definition nfts or nonfungible tokens are a special kind of crypto asset in which each token is unique as opposed to fungible assets like bitcoin and dollar bills which are all worth exactly the same amount because every nft is unique they can be used to authenticate ownership of digital assets like artworks recordings and virtual real estate or petsjamarlin martin ja rule just sold an nft of some artwork related to the fyre festival it was fraudulent but essentially he is selling nfts and folks are now buying nfts spaces in imaginary houses folks are getting really bubble headish in terms of buying stuff that has at a minimum questionable value the nfts are exploding and everyone wants to get into nfts as part of a bubble apple no longer looks interesting netflix it doesn’t look interesting anymore tesla it no longer looks interesting because why would i get into tesla when i can get into leprechaun or nft and i could make  percent the hot money is finding new hot stuff to speculate in and so the bubble just goes on and on and as the bubble progresses the due diligence declines so for example with spacs specialpurpose acquisition company the short story is that it is a backdoor way to go public essentially investors they group up raise money and then they go buy a private company it’s an easier way to go public without the loops the cost and the due diligence so certain companies they wouldn’t be able to go public the traditional way so a spac allows them to kind of going through the back door with a lower due diligence threshold with less discriminating investors who are going to be looking at all the different detailsjamarlin martin spacs are the new thing but with each bubble you’ll see that there’s a downgrade of due diligence so companies are not going public the traditional way they’re going public through spacs of course in the real estate bubble and crisis you saw the downgrading of due diligence in terms of fico scores no docs so in a bubble particularly at the end you start to see the loosening of standards where stuff starts to price aggressively at the same time the due diligence is downgraded ideally the price goes up as the due diligence hey this checks out we’re really looking at all the details so maybe you put a premium on the price a real extreme bubble works opposite essentially the price is going to be really really high as you downgrade the due diligence for example with the crypto complex for example very low due diligence very very high market cap when you see dodge coin was created as a joke and of course elon musk pumped the coin and people started buying “hey elon musk tweets about it that means it’s a good investment so i’m going to buy dodge coin maybe i can make some quick money” the new york times it was reported yesterday they created an nft as a joke some type of article digital asset and it was just a joke and it sold for a half a million dollars you have a lot of bubble head activity out there from my point of view this bubble most likely doesn’t have another  months left – jamarlin martin obviously no one knows when the bubble’s gonna pop but the type of bubble head activity i’m seeing you don’t need necessarily to study financial markets and bubble cycles and economic cycles to know that something is very very wrong out there something stinks out there and that i’m expecting that the joseph kennedys of today they’re gonna start leaning on this market they’re going to start selling not necessarily selling and paranoia or selling all their portfolio but they’re going to start adjusting their positioning because they’ve been around the block they’ve seen the crashes they’ve seen the bubbles and the know what type of greed and personality what type of environment shows up towards the end of a bubblejamarlin martin the last b i want to talk about is joe biden joe biden i don’t really have anything negative to say about joe biden to tell you the truth folks could be on twitter or just bashing joe biden for various reasons bash bash bash joe biden from my perspective joe biden is being joe biden he never said that he was a bernie sanders he never said that he was gonna fight like hell before he won and he never said he’s the type of person he’s going to fight like hell to deliver you a  stimi stimulus check if he says he’s going to deliver you a  stimi so he was very explicit and he said “look i’m not bernie sanders” okay he was very straight up with you he said “i’m not bernie sanders i’m joe biden” and when he was saying “you know joe biden” he’s telling you that he’s not a change figure okay this he’s not a person that would have a lot of conviction and take a lot of risks particularly as it relates to black americajamarlin martin so joe biden when he’s saying look “i’m not bernie sanders i’m joe biden” he’s telling you “i’m the guy i supported the iraq war i’m the guy that was the steve jobs of mass incarceration i’m the guy that built my political career off of political profit in terms of siding with the police the police unions and the private prisons” and the maga voters who love that tough on crime posture joe biden was saying “i’m that guy” and so it’s important for us i’m talking black america it’s important for us to know who joe biden is and who joe biden isn’t because there are biases out there where you hate maga so much or you hate trump so much that means biden is good no you can be in fierce opposition to trump and maga and you acknowledge who joe biden is today okay you don’t give him extra credit like he’s a white jesus you don’t give him credit that he doesn’t deserve joe biden should have to earn credit based on his moral and racist debt with black america he has debts on the books with black america in terms of what he has done joe biden is the same joe biden of yesterday okay he may be doing things in some areas that may be considered more progressive than obama he wants to do a bigger stimulus deal or do this differently than obama but we have to consider the time so it’s easier to do certain things now than it was in my view for obama joe biden is coming at a time where the bernie sanders movement is very strong it’s very influential in the democratic party so it’s not like joe biden has these big convictions but a lot of the good stuff that he would do you got to understand it’s from pressure from the other side of the democratic party it’s not necessarily just i want to be a good guy and look after this issue and that issue the type of career politician joe biden is is he’s going to wait and see what’s acceptable and what’s politically convenient for him and his network i want to leave you with this on joe biden he told the wall street donors that nothing is going to change give me the money like don’t be a menace when the preacher says “just give me the money” – jamarlin martin joe biden told the wall street donors “just give me the money and nothing’s going to change” you can look it up yourself he told the big donors “nothing is really going to change” it’s very important that we understand not the politics in the front we got to understand the politics in the back okay where the money is at the president and politicians in general they have to answer to someone they have to answer to folks that you don’t see in the back okay my intellectual flaw in  with barack obama was i was so excited on the political religion of that time in terms of the idea of someone that i knew had read the final call someone who came from reverend wright’s church i has looked at a lot of the symbolic factors and of course i was optimistic but the intellectual flaw i had in  was i didn’t really inspect the cabinet of barack obama who the people that he would hire i didn’t inspect that i didn’t inspect the politics in the back i was just going off the politics in the front like many of you if i would have inspected the politics in the back i would have known that the big banks the pharmaceutical companies the big silicon valley big tech people google facebook that barack obama structured his cabinet early on for the swamp and elites meaning it was never structured to be progressive it was structured for the elites and kind of do some of the same stuff and actually make the racial and income inequality worse in the united statesjamarlin martin when you look at the geithner the larry summers the eric holder who represented purdue pharma which we’ve talked about on this podcast or ubs that when you look at the obama cabinet this is the corporate confederacy these are the people who are running america so it wouldn’t be intelligent for me or anyone else in my view to expect anything from obama based on how he was structured who he had to report and answer to it just wouldn’t be intelligent for me looking back to expect anything because the way he structured his advisors and cabinet who those people were in terms of lobbyists and they’re connected to the ruling class nothing’s going to change when it’s structured like that you shouldn’t be acting like a santa claus or christmas in terms of hoping for something that’s not structured for material change so you don’t get into it political religion with obama or something else or biden when you start inspecting what’s on the inside the facts and how things are structured okay so when you look at biden in terms of folks from the military industrial complex lobbyists and big tech when you look at the folks that are in his cabinet you shouldn’t be overreaching and expecting something substantial that i don’t think that would be intelligent because he’s not structured that wayjamarlin martin when you inspect his advisors such as his chief of staff ron klain ron klain if you’re not familiar with him the biden chief of staff he’s the one who let the police write the crime bill biden brought him back of course ron klain helped him with the politics of the crime bill and of course the record shows that the police wrote the crime bill and biden and ron klain sat right there and allowed the police to write the crime bill they didn’t really consider how lopsided a bill like that could be if the police the police unions they’re allowed to just write the bill you’re not in the room just ron klain biden and the police – jamarlin martin so i want to leave you with this with biden i wouldn’t expect anything from biden okay he told his donors nothing is really going to change and he structured his administration and cabinet in a way that nothing is likely to change obama sold you hope hope change that you can believe in all these kinds of terms you don’t want to go back to sleep and think that biden is going to do something different biden and obama in a way are like the same political animal essentially who they answer to is not going to be you they are structured where the status quo establishment the corporate confederacy the folks who have been running america and will continue to run americajamarlin martin and on that note in terms of inspecting things hey what are you talking about you don’t know what you’re talking about well let me say this marc andreessen the billionaire in silicon valley the venture capitalist in silicon valley and the cofounder of netscape he said you can look this up he said that when he met obama when he was running for president he said he talked to him and looked in his eyes and he said that this guy is no radical this guy is not going to do sht this guy is going to kind of protect the status quo so the elites with the money they looked and talked to obama in   and they said that this guy is not going to change sht of course a lot of our people we are optimistic people we want to see ourselves we want to believe but the insiders the real smart and money ones they knew that barack obama wasn’t going to do sht he wasn’t going to change anything and they put it on the record they put it on the record in real time they were checking him out the rulers were checking obama out and he said they had conversations with him and they said that this guy poses no risk to the system in my own words pretty much he’s going to keep things much of the same he’s not going to kind of restructure things he may say that in his speeches and suggest that there’s some big change coming but marc andreessen and silicon valley and his people said that he wasn’t going to change sht and we are going to back him you can look that up and that’s in the public recordjamarlin martin thanks
