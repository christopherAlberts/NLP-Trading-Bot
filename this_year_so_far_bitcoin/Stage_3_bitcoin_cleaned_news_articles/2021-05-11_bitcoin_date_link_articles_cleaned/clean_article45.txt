the one bequia development is bringing bitcoin to the caribbean a place that is grossly underserved by international financial institutionsthe caribbean is a region that underscores the global inequality of access to the international financial systemit’s a place full of unique natural resources hardworking people and destinations sought by tourists from around the world but its economies have been thoroughly and devastatingly “derisked” by major global banks a process that has seen these banks place restrictions on caribbean businesses over antimoney laundering aml or other regulatory concerns this makes it exceptionally difficult for caribbean businesses to participate in the legacy financial system particularly for making crossborder fund transfers“banks pulling out of the region include the bank of america scotiabank royal bank of canada and cibc” the center for strategic  international studies reported on the derisking of the caribbean that followed the  financial crisis “banks from the netherlands germany and the united kingdom also restricted their  business with caribbean jurisdictions”of course bitcoin can provide a lifeline for individuals or businesses that find themselves cut off from financial institutions bitcoin is supported by individual nodes running its software and transactions are approved and verified by a network of international miners that are motivated predominately by fees and not required to adhere to any set of regulationsit gives those in the caribbean the chance to capitalize on the value they offer the rest of the world without the restrictive difficulties imposed by international banks — an opportunity being demonstrated clearly by storm gonsalves who grew up in saint vincent and is now constructing the bitcoinforward vacation development one bequiawhy one bequia is embracing bitcoin“banking in the caribbean is over regulated and technologically outdated” gonsalves explained to bitcoin magazine “online banking if available is very basic to send wires can sometimes take weeks opening accounts takes a similar amount of time on top of all that international rules are coming down hard on regional banks while ignoring some of these same rules in their home countries this is all very harmful to the business atmosphere in the region”gonsalves’s development which offers two to fivebedroom villas for sale on the picturesque island of bequia proposes to bring the caribbean economy into the future by enabling bitcoin payments for the properties as well as for daily expenses in the community customers can reserve their villa lot with a deposit of  or the bitcoin equivalent before completing a land holding license application and a construction contract and within  months they can move into their newlybuilt villa once there they will be able to use bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services like meals at the clubhouse groceries or their monthly maintenance feesgonsalves expects one bequia to utilize a financial crimes enforcement network fincen approved processor to accept btc payments and will convert most of the bitcoin he receives into fiat once expenses are covered he will determine what to do with any excess cryptocurrency“aside from all of its practical benefits of ease of transfer traceability and its noninflationary aspects the fact that our acceptance of bitcoin and its technology puts us at the forefront of a global innovation is exciting to say the least” gonsalves said “it’s a game changer”how a move to bitcoin will help caribbean residentsgonsalves hopes one bequia eventually becomes a home for the current and future pioneers of the bitcoin movement showing the world what is possible through a bitcoin standard but he also hopes that it will also help residents of the caribbean open their minds to the power of blockchain technology and financial tools that circumvent the restrictions placed on them in the meantime“living in small island economies leaves you highly susceptible to natural disasters and global economic shocks” he said “at least a portion of income should be held in one of these currencies because we at least need reserves to carry us through turbulent times in the future additionally islanders are very mobile people with a large diaspora i think cryptocurrencies and blockchainbacked financial services can make sending money back home to friends and family much easier”in addition to the hedge that bitcoin can provide to caribbean people gonsalves sees distinct advantages in its ability to preserve privacy“i am a strong believer in privacy and any privacy we lose should be compensated with a significant improvement in time service security and the ease of doing business” he said “the situation we are in now is quite the opposite”ultimately he’s looking for a system that would give caribbean residents the same opportunity to transact internationally that those favored by major global banks have“i think kyc and aml rules are extremely important but should not hinder already fragile economies such as small island tourismagriculturalbased economies that are susceptible to natural disasters as well as global economic shocks” explained gonsalves “we just need an even playing field sending a wire should be the same in the caribbean as it is in developed countries”gonsalves sees potential in blockchain technology at large altcoins and even the “dcash” central bank digital currency launched recently by the eastern caribbean central bank — anything that offers an alternative to the institutions that have derisked the region one bequia will soon be a place that hosts wealthy vacationers who enjoy financial freedom far beyond that of the typical caribbean resident but gonsalves’ goal is to make it a place where the potential for bitcoin to help these residents is realized“i think of one bequia as more than just a real estate development” he said “i see it as a meeting of minds this development will put in close proximity some of the greatest thinkers and doers in the world hopefully the success of this project can show the world the potential of bitcoin”
