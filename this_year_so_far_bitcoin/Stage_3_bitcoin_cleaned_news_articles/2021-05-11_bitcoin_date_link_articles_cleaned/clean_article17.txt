it took just one joke to send the value of dogecoin one of the worlds most popular cryptocurrencies crashing down the cryptocurrency which itself began as a social media joke eight years ago lost more than a third of its price after elon musk one of the worlds richest men and dogecoins most prominent supporter called the digital currency a hustle during his appearance on the saturday night live comedy sketch tv show this past weekendthe sharp fall was an anticlimax to a weekslong buildup by dogecoin enthusiasts in the runup to musks appearance as a guest host on the popular show dogecoins price had climbed to a record high before the show aired as fans organized watch parties in anticipation of a major boost for the cryptocurrency following musks appearancemusk is probably happy to jump on the joke of what is a memecoin but investors are probably feeling real pain now said justin danethan hong kongbased head of exchange sales at diginex a digital asset exchangethe supply is essentially unlimited  and so unsustainable longterm its a question of who will sell first and who will be left holding the bagsinterest in cryptocurrencies has surged over the past year pushing the value of all digital coins past  trillion € trillion propped up by trillions of dollars in stimulus by governments and central banks and endorsement from some institutional investorswhile bitcoin the most valued cryptocurrency by some distance has hogged much of the limelight and seen record rallies its the socalled altcoins such as ethereum and dogecoin that have taken charge in recent dayswhats behind dogecoins surging popularitythere is no easy explanation behind the rising prices of dogecoin which was created as a joke riffing on the  cryptocurrency frenzy with the shiba inu dog breed as its logo a deluge of cash thanks to government stimulus plans speculation coupled with a fear of missing out a dogged endorsement from musk and some pure online fun thanks to social medias fondness for the doge meme are some reasons behind dogecoins dream run that has seen the currency surge more than  in the past yeardogecoin mania started with primarily retail traders who came from social media platforms the retail trading community seemed convinced dogecoin was going to  dollar and for many fundamentals did not matter edward moya senior market analyst at oanda told dw celebrity endorsements from elon musk and mark cuban provided a justification for many early investors and drove the latest fervorin a major boost to dogecoins stardom musks commercial rocket firm spacex has accepted payment for a lunar satellite mission in the cryptocurrency the dogecoinfunded mission slated for  is called  mission to the moonis dogecoin the next bitcoinwell thats been one of the most searched questions related to cryptocurrencies on google over the past few months dogecoin and bitcoin are two very different beasts even if the former is based on the same software code that underpins bitcoindogecoin can potentially have an infinite supply which means those looking to remain invested in the coin for a longer duration stand to see the value of their investment diminish over time bitcoin on the other hand has a fixed supply of  million units which makes it scarce and in return more valuable — much like gold and diamonds which are also in limited supplywhile dogecoin was designed to be a cryptocurrency for sillies bitcoin was always designed to be a decentralized digital currency an alternative to central bankcontrolled fiat money many diehard fans of digital currencies see dogecoin and the speculative fervor around it as undermining their larger goal of taking cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum mainstream they say the memecoin is just a speculative asset with few institutional investors backing iteven though dogecoin has come a long way from its satirical origins to being a popular peertopeer cryptocurrency its nowhere close to threatening bitcoins dominance its  billion valuation is just a fraction of bitcoins  trilliondogecoin is cryptokindergarten it was created to have some fun and also illustrate how cryptocurrencies work jeff gallas the founder of the german bitcoin foundation told dw so its a good thing to maybe just start out with to educate oneself about how cryptocurrencies work and not take it too seriouslyis dogecoin a good investmentit depends on who you ask dogecoin fans swear by it touting it as a cryptocurrency of the future with musk anointing it the peoples crypto its low transaction fees and large supply make it convenient for netizens to use the coin to tip online content like bloggers and creators on reddit and youtube its also easier to mine — the process of creating new bitcoin through complex math problems — which means transactions with dogecoin can be processed faster than with bitcoinothers see dogecoin as a highly speculative and risky investment much more than bitcoin or ethereum despite musks support for the currency none of his companies have publicly invested in dogecoin as yet unlike bitcoineven musk has urged people to invest with caution and said it was unwise to invest ones life savings in cryptocurrencies which should be considered speculative for nowdogecoin is unlikely to become the preferred coin that is used by corporate america but for now retail interest could keep dogecoin suffering a similar fate as gamestop said moya dogecoins valuation is not justifiable but the retail support seems relentless and could keep its prices elevated well above a justifiable valuationwith contribution from reuters news agency
