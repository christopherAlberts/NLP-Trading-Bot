there exists a security problem inherent to bitcoinâ€™s transparency that needs to be addressed by the communitybitcoin has a fungibility issue it is transparent which can be both good and bad transparency allows everyone to check how many bitcoin are in circulation and to ensure that nobody is cheatingbut it also allows bad actors such as governments to monitor the chain and compromise users privacywhen a new user buys bitcoin using a regulated know your customer kyc exchange his information including bitcoin address government id and other identifying information is being provided to his local government this information allows them to view the activity of his wallet since his coins are linked to his identity it also allows easier seizure in case of a government ban on bitcointhis is obviously dangerous especially if you live under an authoritarian government there are options available for buying bitcoin without revealing your identity and compromising your privacy but those are less popular and are usually harder to followthis calls for a privacy standard in bitcoin where a majority of wallets enable privacy features by default making it much harder for chain analysis firms to link transactions and wallets to reallife identities andor previous transactions users must make sure each and every one of our transactions are private this can be achieved by utilizing tools like coinjoins payjoins and other privacy enhancing techniques while these tools are no silver bullet using them in the right way can allow users to achieve a remarkable amount of privacy stealth addresses also have an important role in the privacy standard as they allow users to share their addresses without needing to worry about them being linked to their digital or physical identity running your own node will also play an important part dramatically reducing the possibility that a node will be used to link your transaction history to your reallife ip address which can be used to deanonymize your transactionsif we are able to do that we will be able to disarm chain analysis companies chain analysis firms specialize in invading bitcoin users privacy they do it using publicly available onchain data and then cross reference it with other data such as kyc records in order to establish a deterministic link between a users wallet activity and his reallife identitythe worst thing about those companies is that they dont work exclusively for governments they work with whoever is willing to pay them whether its a government advertising company or a creepy stalker it doesnt matter to them those companies are pure poison for bitcoin and are completely unnecessary in the bitcoin ecosystem they only bring harm and suffering to itthere are plenty of users that are targeted by these companies simply because they stated they hate the idea of chain surveillance a good example for this would be darkdotfails donation address being flagged in multiple exchanges that have a partnership with these companies chain surveillance is not about money laundering crime or any other illegal activity its about creating an age where nobody has the right to keep their finances private a bitcoin privacy standard aims to kill these purely evil companies but this requires the bitcoin community to come together put the ego aside and work together to create use and promote tools that will enable this effortthe hardest part of standardizing bitcoin privacy would be making people acknowledge bitcoins faults when it comes to privacy many will just avoid talking about it and some dont even know it exists creating such a standard would require large community consensus not because we need to change the protocol but because we need to make people acknowledge the fact that their privacy is being compromised a privacy standard would also discourage discrimination against those who want to keep their bitcoin finances private see this postthey can censor a minority but not a majoritywe need more wallets like this and more enthusiasm toward building and using bitcoin privacy tools numbergoup is not all that matters in this peaceful revolution privacy matters toothis is a guest post by yonatan opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of btc inc or bitcoin magazinethe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc
