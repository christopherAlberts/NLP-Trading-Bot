forget a digital dollar bank on bitcoinsince the us abandoned the gold standard the value of a currency is what it represents not what it’s backed by digital or otherwisematun rubbed his beard between his fingers and surveyed his substantial property in a lush green suburb of the ancient chinese city of luoyangthe  century merchant and trader ma had made his fortune plying the lucrative trade between the port city of shanghai and the eastern end of the silk road of xi’anyet trade and industry in  century china was anything but straightforward with imperial palms needing to be greased and greedy officials always looking for more than their pound of fleshso when a particularly greedy qing dynasty official inspected ma’s substantial storehouse of grain to determine how much he should be getting from this month’s taking ma had had enoughyears earlier ma had received an official jade tablet from a high qing official but had refrained from using it for fear of being seen to have abused that official’s authorityso when the greedy qing official was looking to take a bite out of ma’s storehouse of grain for the umpteenth time ma reached into his pockets and brought out the jade tablet at which point the qing official fell to his kneesbut a jade tablet was really nothing more than that — a piece of jade no more sinister than any piece of jewelryyet the corrupt qing official was not fearful of the jade tablet itself but rather what it symbolized that ma had a relationship and the sanction of someone much higher than himselfmoney as symbolicthroughout history symbols have come to define the human conditionwe swear by our symbols we bleed for them and in some cases we even die for themwhether it’s the flag or for the cross the colors we wear or the right to wear colors symbols hold sway over us in ways that aren’t always immediately obviouswhich is where the dollar comes inas the world’s reserve currency many academic treatises have attempted to dissect where the value of the dollar truly liesalthough the us is home to just  of the world’s population the dollar makes up over  of the world’s global foreign exchange reserves and in the world’s foreign exchange markets around  involves the dollaryet despite concerns that the us has trillions of dollars in foreign debt and continues large deficit spending the greenback still holds trust and confidence in its ability to pay its obligations much to the consternation of rival nations and to the bewilderment of those who predict the dollar’s demisethe issue with predicting the demise of the dollar is that it presupposes that the value of a currency lies in the value of a country’s economy but it’s so much more than thatbearing in mind that ever since the us abandoned the bretton woods system where a dollar was backed by its equivalent in gold the economic anchor by which a dollar’s value was measured has long been untetheredif a dollar was only as good as the gold that was behind it then hyperinflation of the style of zimbabwe or argentina should already have occurred in these united states but it hasn’tand that’s why to understand the value of any currency it’s first necessary to understand what it represents ideologically more so than what it represents economicallywhich brings us to china’s digital yuanchinese cryptocurrencythere are some in washington who believe that beijing’s digital yuan could pose a serious challenge to dollar dominanceto be sure although china is the world’s second largest economy the chinese yuan only makes up a paltry  of the world’s foreign currency reservespart of the reason of course is by designfearful that newly monied chinese will spirit away capital from the middle kingdom the chinese yuan is not a fully convertible currency limiting its appeal as a global reserve currencyand while china leads the world in electronic payments thanks to the vision of alibaba and tencent in building out alipay and wechat pay it also leads the world in capital controls having also built a formidable financial wall for its citizensso why then is beijing so nervous when it comes to cryptocurrencies in particular bitcoin if its true goal is to wrestle dollar dominance in international finance away from washingtonwhy go through all the trouble of almost all but banning cryptocurrencies while simultaneously creating your ownwhy not make the yuan fully convertible and compete with the dollar on the global stagea fascinating article written in february by former people’s bank of china governor xiaochuan zhou is revealingin that article zhou explains the fundamentally defensive character of the digital yuanblockchain technology features decentralization but decentralization is not a necessity for modernizing the payments system it even has some drawbacksso beijing was all about the block to economically chain its citizens just not in the decentralized hands of bitcoinlast year the people’s bank of china “pboc”seized the opportunity presented by the pandemic to rush its digital yuan into the hands of the chinese launching trials of its digital currency in three major cities shenzhen suzhou and chengdubut lest you think that the digital yuan was intended to supplant china’s existing financial system beijing made it clear that the digital yuan would run on a twotier systemon one level the pboc will continue to deal with existing stateowned commercial banks and other entities including telecom and tech firms issuing digital yuan to themwhile the pboc controls the digital yuan electronic payment services such as alipay and wechat pay alongside legacy banks continue to serve as intermediaries to consumers and businessesto borrow a chinese proverb it is to shoot two hawks with one arrowbeijing not only defends the chinese communist party against cryptocurrencies it also reigns in the enormous power of its big tech companies all while ensuring that it has the power to surveil its citizens’ transactionsand that is the primary purpose of the digital yuan that it gives the dollar a run for its money overseas is a byproducta yuan for everythingit’s no secret that washington has overwhelming influence over the allegedly neutral and belgiumbased for good measure society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication or swiftswift is like the money super highway and washington’s significant influence over it is what makes us financial sanctions so effective and punishing to enemies of the united stateswhich is why the chinese and russians and every other country which has suffered the sting of us sanctions have been actively exploring ways to challenge dollar dominance for yearsone of which of course has been using china’s digital yuan through initiatives such as the multiple cbdc bridge project by the hong kong monetary authority and bank of thailand to implement a cross border payments system based on distributed ledgersbeijing’s goal isn’t so much to replace the dollar but to create a financial system parallel to it that serves those whose ideals and ideologies are not necessarily in line with america’sit isn’t that china’s digital currency is going to become the dominant standard of payments it’s that it could be one standard creating a rival system that operates alongside the americanled financial world order and offer an alternative to those who are not ideologically aligned with americaand therein lies the bigger worryit’s easy to view currency in purely economic terms — as a unit of account a store of value and a medium of exchangebut bear in mind that all of these qualities that we place on currency all have ideological overhangsit assumes that we agree what a unit is what value means and what we’re willing to give up in exchange for a unit of currencyviewed from the lens of ideology it’s why the dollar won’t disappear easilyyes america is profligate but the dollar is so much more than debtfor the millions who are oppressed around the world the dollar is a symbol of economic freedom it represents a set of values and ideals a yearning for a betterment of economic selfa quote wrongly attributed to us president abraham lincoln but nonetheless relevant readsamerica will never be destroyed from the outside if we lose our freedoms it will be because we have destroyed ourselves from withinit won’t be the digital yuan that spells the demise of the dollar it will be americans’ own loss of faith in the greenback that will be its undoingwhich is why bitcoin is at a pivotal moment — it harkens back to a time when the dollar was backed by gold and the concept of currency was anchored in something that was certainbully for bitcoinunless you’ve been living under a rock chances are you’ve heard about bitcoin by nowbut for the multitude who haven’t read the  bitcoin whitepaper you really should and the ninth page is just references bitcoin was positioned to be a “purely peertopeer version of electronic cash” that allows “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution”in a nutshell bitcoin is a public ledger that is simultaneously updated and shared by a network of computers that also serve to secure its blockchainto “pay” someone using bitcoin you simply send a signed message transferring ownership to a receiver’s public address key and transactions are grouped together and added to the ledger in blocks hence the use of the term “blockchain” and every node in the network those computers mentioned earlier has an entire copy of this ledger blockchain at all timesa node computer can add a block to the chain and receive a bitcoin reward only by solving a complex cryptographic puzzle chosen by the bitcoin protocol which consumes processing power in the processnodes that solve these cryptographic puzzles — also known as “miners” — are then rewarded not only with transaction fees but also with more bitcoins known as the “mining reward”this mining reward will get cut in half every four years on average until the total number of bitcoins reaches  million after which no new bitcoins will ever be createdso now that you’re up to speed on what bitcoin is it’s time to consider what bitcoin representsa large part of the reason for bitcoin’s success is that bitcoin in and of itself is sovereign — no one controls itsure there are bitcoin “whales” who own plenty of bitcoin and miners who mine it but no single entity rules itabove all bitcoin is smartwith every day that bitcoin continues to work — not being hacked not crashing — the predictions that bitcoin will one day end up worthless that means you nouriel roubini appear more and more hollowand the pressure on people to affirm their own smartness by owning bitcoins grows strongerwhile bitcoin may have first caught on with the tech fringe it’s come full circle with tech veterans including elon musk originally on the fringe himself with paypalover the past year tech companies like square paypal microstrategy and tesla have all piled into bitcoinand from legacy tech legacy investors including paul tudor jones stanley druckenmiller and bill miller were also bitten by the bitcoin bugperhaps even more significantly bitcoin came to be treated like a legitimate part of the financial system — one of the oldest banks in the united states bank of new york mellon now handles bitcoin and so does visa and mastercardthere are wellfunctioning futures and options markets for bitcoin and “xbt” the symbol for bitcoin appears on bloomberg terminals across the globeand as bitcoin has grown more respectable the early cryptocurrency adopters have already moved on to decentralized finance or defi an open permissionless and highly interoperable protocol stack built on public smart contract platforms chief among which is the ethereum blockchainlike bitcoin defi has no centralized “trusted third party” intermediaries for verification and regulation of the systema much looser more variegated system with multiple coins tokens exchanges debt markets derivatives and asset management protocols defi has the potential to create an entirely parallel financial systembut don’t take my word for it look at what fabian schär writing for the us federal reserve bank of st louis notesthis architecture can create an immutable and highly interoperable financial system with unprecedented transparency equal access rights and little need for custodians central clearing houses or escrow services as most of these roles can be assumed by ‘smart contracts’atomic swaps autonomous liquidity pools decentralized stablecoins and flash loans are just a few of many examples that show the great potential of this ecosystemdefi may lead to a paradigm shift in the financial industry and potentially contribute toward a more robust open and transparent financial infrastructureif the dollar represents an imperfect symbol of democracy then decentralization whether via bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency may be its actualizationbecause the dollar represents an american brand of democracy warts and all it risks limiting itself to carving up the world along cold warera battle lines — “them” the iron curtain of totalitarianism and “us” — democracyor at least that seems to be how the biden administration is approaching the challenge of the digital yuangiven biden’s advanced age it comes as little surprise that his administration believes in keynesian google it demand management and stimulusin a nutshell economist john maynard keynes had theorized that during the great depression of the  government spending had to take the place of a drop in private consumption to keep the economy goingfast forward to our present era and the biden administration has ushered in an unprecedented period of fiscal and monetary expansion that while triggered by a public health emergency is now being used as cover for a prolonged use of such policy toolsmeanwhile in foreign policy biden and his colleagues seem committed to maintain a cold war stance against china undermining the enduring credibility of the us dollar as the preeminent global reserve currency and undermining the value of us treasuries as the world’s safest financial assetsyet it is precisely these power structures of america that are being threatened by the rise of an alternative financial system that essentially bypasses the federal reserve and potentially the us treasury system altogetherand that’s what the digital yuan is genuinely targeting — decentralization not the dollarwhen the chinese first came across bitcoin they understood its value almost instantly and in a way that would take americans years more to fully graspfor millions of chinese involved with cryptocurrencies these nascent digital assets represented portable economic power free from fear or favor from beijing — economic democracy where political democracy did not existand that’s why beijing needed to rush out its own digital currency — because it assumes that ease of use as opposed to ideology is what drives the economic humanwhile the messy and chaotic democracy of america may not be what every citizen on earth aspires to the economic democracy of self surely isif we accept that as human beings all of us yearn to be free then the dollar is the beta version of that aspiration cryptocurrencies may be the evolution of thatinstead of attempting to issue a digital dollar washington should look to embrace bitcoin and cryptocurrencies because decentralization is what will ultimately allow america to dominate not the dollaramerica’s power lies not in its system of centralization but in its system of decentralization — it’s why the federal system endures despite so many challenges to its structureputting power in the hands of the many as opposed to the few was the very raison d’être of the founding of the united states of america also perhaps a reluctance to pay taxes to the crown but i digressin  the chinese communist party restricted the ability of its citizens to buy bitcoin and by the looks of things is set to continue clamping down on cryptocurrenciesthat should be the biggest clue as to what beijing’s true target is — bitcoin first the dollar maybe next
