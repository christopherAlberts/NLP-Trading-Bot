bitcoin sv dedicated transaction processors have shown interest in offering fiat payments for clients to interact in and with bitcoinhowever there are quite a few voices within bitcoin sv that have stated that accepting fiat instead of satoshis is disadvantageouswe caught up with daniel krawisz to explore the competition of satoshis and fiat money in the bitcoin networkhi daniel in our last interviews we talked about bitcoin sv bsv in general and speculating in and on bitcointoday we would like to hear your thoughts on the fact that transaction processors are able to accept fiat money as a payment for transaction fees instead of satoshis so called  satbyte transaction fee and even process transactions without moving any satoshis on the blockchain so called  sat transactionsfirst of all this topic has been lively debated within the bitcoin sv sphere already i invite you to use this article as a basis for our talk today as well as this twitter post from youi would be concerned if miners didnt want to be paid in bsv the satoshi is what ensures that everybody is invested in each other that is what ensures that everyone is cooperative i made that point here  — daniel krawisz – end mass scams with proofofwork danielkrawisz november  why exactly are you concerned if transaction processors  miners do not want to be paid in bitcoin sv bsvdaniel krawisz if you don’t think that satoshis are the best money and you don’t want them because that proves that you think that an integral part of bitcoin is worse than some alternative why would bitcoin succeed if the money part was so broken that people actually working on bitcoin preferred some alternative if i was some business man or government official talking to some bitcoin transaction processor and they didn’t even want bitcoin i would think “obviously these people don’t really think that bitcoin actually works so why would i want this bitcoin as a service”money is about specialization and the division of labor if you want to be paid in fiat that means you want to specialize with a different group of people than with the bitcoiners why do you not want to specialize with the bitcoiners bitcoiners are better at it because they have better money if you do not want to specialize with bitcoiners then what are you even doing here if bitcoiners are not good for specializing with then you would not expect the network to be capable of providing a good service and you would not want to build a business on itpeople who want to offer bitcoin as a service and be paid in fiat look like they understand nothing and are probably running a business that would fail easily and that should be easy to compete with and it looks like they are sending the message to the world that they think bitcoiners are losers maybe this business is actually buying bitcoin behindthescenes and really the people running it don’t think bitcoin is a failure however a much better way of getting bitcoins than buying them from exchanges is telling customers that they must give them to you this business could be successfully competed with by creating a similar business which pushed the cost of dealing with exchanges on to customersin our other interview about bitcoin and speculation you saidpeople who think that transaction volume will drive up the price of bitcoin are people who believe the fisher quantity theory even if they have never heard of it … in any case transaction volume is not the cause of value rather value is the cause of transaction volume … trying to drive up transaction volume does not necessarily do anything good unless you are a miner earning transaction fees it does not mean that bitcoin is going up of course you would want to earn bitcoin so you want to drive up transaction volume because of that but in that case you don’t care about transaction volume you just care about what you earnednow that is interesting is it not all about being profitable be it in fiat bitcoin or anythingdaniel krawisz the definition of profit depends on the definition of money the way you use money isstart with money spend money to make more money go back into moneythere is a cycle money is safety and entrepreneurship is risk with money you go through a cycle of risk and reward if you end up with more then you have profited and if you end up with less you have lossa question we may ask here is more of what many goods can be used as money something which would have got you more of one good is not necessarily something that would have got you more of a different good if you had been trying to run a bitcoin business over the last  years there would be many instances in which you could have made a big profit in dollars that would be a loss in terms of satoshis and vice versathis is what i mean when i say that the definition of profit depends on the definition of money “profit or loss” just means “more or less money” in the real world we do not know if you have more or less until we know what money is right now in the real world there is more than one type of money there are many competing protomonies thus we do not truly know who has more and who has lessthus when you say “is it not all about being profitable be it fiat bitcoin or anything” i would say that there is a big difference between profiting in fiat vs bitcoin and understanding this difference is a key to forming strategies concerning bitcoin’s success so we can’t just ignore itnow as to the quote that you showed me this quote merely says that transaction volume does not drive up the price of bitcoin rather prices and transaction volume are caused by the same thing which is called valuevalue is the expected benefit that derives from a good prices are caused by people’s beliefs about value ie what they believe about expected value transaction volume is also caused by value because value is a motivator to try to get more bitcoinsif you say “transaction volume drives up prices” you are effectively saying that two things are economically related by forgetting about the part that involves human motivation therefore you are not really thinking realistically about economics at all you have pretty much removed the main thing about itwhat is the value of money in the austrian theory the value of money has to do with the fact that you do not know everything that is happening in the whole economy money is the good which puts you first in line to take advantage of new opportunity the advantage of holding cash over earning income from stock is that of having the first opportunity to buy a different stock at a cheaper pricemises famously said that money is a present good the everpresent possibility of discovering a better option that you didn’t know about is the reason you need to hold money instead of spending itmoney can of course also be a future good you would do this if you thought that there would be better opportunities in the future and you were expecting other people to realize this after you and drive up the valuationif we want bitcoin to go up therefore we want to ensure that the amount of unknown opportunities is going up that is not the same as transaction volume although it does as i have said result in transaction volume it is different because prices are forwardlooking thus transaction volume does not drive up price but rather the price is driven up by people who predict more transaction volume in the future if people did not believe that there would be any transaction volume tomorrow then no amount of transaction volume today would drive the price upi would say that the austrian theory implies that every transaction that actually happens makes bitcoin less valuable because this is the moment that an opportunity is realized obviously i do not believe that transaction volume is bad or evil as people in btc have concluded the reality is that all opportunity is fleeting so we have to constantly create morewhat are the advantages if transaction processors solely accept bitcoin sv bsv the satoshis as a payment for their servicesdaniel krawisz the advantage to transaction processors is that they do not have to worry that bsv will go up a lot before they can buy it with those other currencies time lag is introduced when you accept other monies maybe not a lot but prices move at the speed of thoughtlooking at the title of the bitcoin white paper it says “bitcoin a peer to peer electronic cash system” it does not say “bitcoin a peer to peer electronic cash” it says “system” at the end is it not a hint at what bitcoin is capable of aside from being used as cash directly by moving satoshis arounddaniel krawisz maybe it is a hint that bitcoin can be used for many different kinds of cash and that miners can earn a lot of money by processing the transactions for these tokens that is a very good way for bitcoiners to serve the world and i would certainly be happy to earn lots of transaction fees from providing this service however it would be exactly the kind of transaction volume that does not drive up the price of satoshis since it has to do with serving the rest of the world rather than bitcoiners serving each otherhowever i think that there is a lot more opportunity in making bitcoin more valuable than in processing fiat tokens i want to do things that have to do with bitcoiners serving each other that does not mean we shouldn’t serve the rest of the world too i think that if we did a lot more to serve each other that would be a much better reason for people to join the bitcoin economy than if we were serving the rest of the world and we would just get a lot more out of it for the amount of effort we put inpeople are always trying to do things with bitcoin other than just use it as money yes there are many wonderful things you can do with bitcoin but i think the money function has been neglected even though that’s worth the mostusing bitcoin as money means providing things for each other that we actually need i want to live a good life bitcoin is a way for people to derive more value from each other you couldn’t really have anything better than that that is what i want to do and this is what i would want to get out of bitcoinwhen we talk about bitcoin do we have to differentiate between bitcoin the token and bitcoin the networksystem because for me it seems there are two bitcoins out there and we are using the same word for bothdaniel krawisz yes there is an ambiguityyou said this on twitteryour power comes from your ability to satisfy other peoples genuine needs — daniel krawisz – end mass scams with proofofwork danielkrawisz march  don’t transaction processors satisfy the genuine need of businesses that – at least for now – do not want to deal with satoshisdaniel krawisz they do but at what cost if bitcoin is really better money then you should be able to save costs by not using other moniesthere needs to be a double coincidence of wants in order for a trade to happen you cannot just be indifferent to the kind of money you want they are all different i would want to tell the customer what kind of money i would want before i would sell him anything choosing the correct money to accept could end up mattering a lot more than the value of your whole business so i think it’s pretty silly if someone says that he is indifferent over fiat versus bitcoini would only offer things for fiat at a premiumwhy not let fiat and satoshis compete in the bitcoin networkdaniel krawisz we can let them compete in our minds first and that saves a lot of time that is not to say that we know how to simulate reality perfectly but i think that we could save a lot of time in bitcoin by thinking a lot more about what we want to build before actually doing itlet us talk about what happens when transaction processors get paid in bitcoin sv as soon as they receive a payment in satoshis—be it a transaction fee or a payment for another bitcoin related service—they then hold these satoshisas soon as they hold the satoshis they automatically become speculators they hold satoshis and speculate on it if they sell it right away for fiat they have left the speculative sphere if they stay in satoshis they keep being speculatorswhy would transaction processors want to be speculators they are not speculators but transaction processors what do you thinkdaniel krawisz if you hold fiat you are also a speculator why do you say that you stop speculating if you hold fiat you do not know what will happen before you have a chance to spend the money you have fiat or satoshis if you have them you must predict their future to know that you can spend themisn’t it all about specialization transaction processors specialize in processing transactions they do not specialize in speculation and if they speculate without being specialized in speculation they probably get outcompeted by specialized speculatorsdaniel krawisz speculation is not a specialty it is something that everyone must do and they have no choice about it there is an uncertain future that you must bet on if you are alivespeculation has to do with the application of differential knowledge that which you know that other people don’t know there is no specialty in knowing what others don’t know that is always changing people who are very good or lucky may be able to get away on only speculating but only because life is finite however if you never want to speculate then that means you know nothing that others don’t know which is probably not true and would be very sad for you if it werespeculation is not a real job no matter how much people pretend it is knowledge that is good will get you a job and sometimes will be relevant to the whole world that’s when you can speculate if you try to speculate all the time you just lose everything the moment something happens that you don’t understand in order to specialize in speculation you would have to know everythingevery time you speculate you lose some of the ability to speculate further because the market learns from everything you do the market is a godlike being formed out of everybody else’s mind see mr market a parable from ben grahamthe market is antiinductive which means that attempts to learn about it cause it to evolve it will absorb your differential knowledge until you have none left you must keep learning new tricks every time you speculatehowever if you try not to speculate on bitcoin then you lose out on the biggest amount of money i do not think a business is really very good or has a good understanding of bitcoin if it doesn’t want to speculate the business should be like the person i described above having a regular income but prepared for moments when its knowledge is relevant to the whole marketif you don’t want to speculate on bitcoin that’s like saying you don’t think bitcoin is poorly understood what kind of bitcoin business would have people who don’t think that one that lacks knowledge of success and could be easily defeated by competitionhonestly i think that the value of money is not that complicated and the market is behaving like there’s almost no understanding of it all you have to do is look at how well bitcoiners are serving each other every few years that’s what money is all about and people aren’t really even thinking about this as far as i can tell most people will not learn it no matter how much i repeat it so it is like differential knowledge that never goes away i could write it all in this interview and everybody could read it and the market would still not act like it has been understood why as a business would you not want to speculate given these conditions to me that shows you don’t really know what you’re doing and there’s something a lot better you could be doing for a lot less workone day of course bitcoin will be better understood speculation on bitcoin will be a lot more difficult then that does not mean that you would not want to do it it just means that you have to spend more time on your boring job and less time worrying about the world economy everybody knows something important that other people do not know and that will never change all that will change is how often the opportunity to speculate will arisethanks danielnew to bitcoin check out coingeek’s bitcoin for beginners section the ultimate
