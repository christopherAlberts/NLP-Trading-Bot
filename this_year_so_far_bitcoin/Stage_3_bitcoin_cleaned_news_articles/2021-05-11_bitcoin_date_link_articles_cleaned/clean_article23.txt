is there a bitcoin supply shortage on exchangesyes and nothe bitcoin balance on exchanges has received a lot of attention during this bull run because the change in these balances sticks out in previous bull runs what can be observed is that often with bitcoin’s price increasing the bitcoin balance on exchanges has increased this can be seen in figure  where glassnode has compiled the addresses of spot exchanges holding bitcoin and aggregated themeven with bitcoin’s price going sideways or down historically the trend has been upward this trend has reversed during this bull run and since march  the bitcoin balance on exchanges has been in a declining trend this trend has been going on for over a year now compared to that in or right before the last bull run the fall in exchange balance from july to december  lasted only six months before taking off in  with bitcoin’s price taking off as well if the underlying dynamics have not changed and the exchange balance drop in  and what followed in  is an indication the prolonged decline in exchange balances this time might be a set up for a major bull run this is not the topic of this article but that trend is majorly driven by outflows from coinbase and thus highly likely by institutional and large investors this indicates that bitcoins might not flow back to exchanges in bigger amounts any time soon before hitting this cycle’s top so the patterns might not repeat as in  and bitcoin could hit a new alltime high with the bitcoin balance on exchanges decliningfigure  bitcoin balance on exchanges stacked august  –april  opposed to coinbase for example binance has seen strong inflows of bitcoin more recently this is most likely retail depositing bitcoin on binance to trade altcoinsthe general bitcoin supply drop on exchanges has led many people in the community myself included to talk about a supply shortage or even supply squeeze of bitcoin that will lead bitcoin’s price to inevitably shoot up at some point when supply dries up while it is true that bitcoin’s supply is dropping once you look at the supply held on exchanges in usd terms the picture looks a bit different in figure  both the bitcoin balance on exchanges and the bitcoin balance on exchanges in terms of usd is shown from  onward from the first glance at the graph it appears that in usd terms we can’t really talk about a supply shortage let alone supply squeeze on exchanges with bitoin’s price taking off in  the supply on exchanges in usd has also been shooting upfigure  bitcoin balance on exchanges in btc and in usd january  –april   btc balance on exchanges source glassnode btc price in usd source investingcomthough the supply increase in usd terms this halving cycle looks impressive particularly compared to that in  it is also interesting to look at the changes in relative terms in table  you can see the minimum and maximum exchange balance during halving cycle  november  –july   halving cycle  july  –may   and the present halving cycle that started on may  i have calculated how much the supply has increased from the minimum to the maximum  days into each halving cycle as of the time of this writing we are now  days into the third halving april   you will notice that in cycle  the increase has been quite massive compared to the other ones as i show in my article “halving cycles and the bitcoin price” cycle  has been rather exceptional in terms of price performance so that number does not seem that relevant as a guidethe changes in cycle  are more relevant however in the present cycle up until the current date april   the supply in usd went up roughly six times while in cycle  it increased by nearly eight times this seems to be a substantial gap as the gap not only is influenced by the bitcoin balance on exchanges but also by the increase in prices while the drop in bitcoin balances on exchanges is increasing that gap an increase in bitcoin’s price is narrowing it in the present cycle bitcoin is outperforming cycle  pricewise now  days into this cycle bitcoin’s price increased by nearly  while in cycle  it only increased by roughly  over the same time span this means that the gap would have been much bigger with a similar price performance as in cycle table  exchange supply calculations in usd terms for the halving cycles  days into the cycle btc balance on exchanges source glassnode btc price in usd source investingcomto account for that i have calculated the exchange balance gap for this cycle by adjusting for cycle  prices in table  the minimum balance in usd terms on exchanges coincides with day one of this halving cycle at that time there were roughly  bitcoin on spot exchanges this amount of bitcoin is then multiplied by the price of bitcoin at day one during cycle  this gives us an idea of how much the minimum balance on exchanges would have been in terms of usd at cycle  prices i have done the same for the maximum balance on exchanges the maximum balance on exchanges in terms of usd this cycle has been on day  with roughly  bitcoin which is substantially lower than on day one i have now multiplied this amount of bitcoin with the price of bitcoin  days into cycle  with that i have minimum and maximum numbers that are adjusted for cycle ’s prices these allow me to calculate a hypothetical supply change and to calculate the supply gap between both cycles adjusted for cycle ’s prices the supply on exchanges in usd terms has only increased roughly  times versus  times without adjustments this is a large difference compared to the nearly eight times increase in cycle  from table  we can really begin to speak about a bitcoin exchange balance supply shortage heretable  present cycle statistics adjusted for cycle  prices btc balance on exchanges source glassnode btc price in usd source investingcomwhile other factors at play could explain the difference in price performance of the two cycles the drop in bitcoin supply on spot exchanges is majorly driven by largescale investors and coinbase seems to play a key factorto conclude purely looking at the bitcoin balance on exchanges we can observe a clear trend in this cycle where the supply keeps falling on the other hand looking at bitcoin’s supply in usd terms the trend is upward driven by bitcoin’s price performance this price performance is of course not externally driven and influenced by the supply on exchanges as i have shown the gap in usd terms is already substantial without adjusting for prices and after adjusting for cycle  prices the supply gap in usd terms becomes very large an increase of nearly eight times in cycle  versus an increase of less than four times this cycle so once we look at relative terms between the present cycle and cycle  there also seems to be a supply shortage in usd terms and not only in terms of bitcoin following this the bitcoin balance on exchanges is an essential metric during this cycle which warrants a closer look to see where bitcoin is headed next and as explained earlier could be a potential setup for a major bull runthis is a guest post by jan wuestenfeld opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not
