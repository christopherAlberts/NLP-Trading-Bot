in episode four of pitchit the fintech startups podcast we talk with cheese cofounder zhen wangcheese is a digital bank focused on the asian american community one thing i found striking in talking with zhen was the importance of language in financial products immigrants have many barriers when they enter america one such barrier is the fine print for various financial products these pamphlets are not written clearly and they tend to hide fees for users cheese is aiming to help users better understand products by translating the print into their native languagethe cofounders of cheese experienced these very issues firsthand which allowed them to fully grasp the problem and build an emphatic solution zhen also discussed some of the early growth trends they are seeing with users and the broader trend of building an identity driven businessin this podcast you will learndownload a pdf of the transcription of podcast no  zhen wangclick to read podcast transcription full text version belowpitchit fintech startups podcast no –zhen wangwelcome to pitchit the fintech startups podcast one founder one startup one investor at a time i’m your host todd anderson chief product officer lendit fintechmusictodd anderson in episode  we talk with zhen wang cofounder of cheese cheese is a digital bank focused on the asian american community you know founders usually share an experience that helps them formulate an idea and that was certainly the case with cheese i spoke to zhen about his journey to cheese the impact language can have in financial services and a little tennis for good measure i think we had a lot of fun and i hope you all enjoy the showmusicwelcome to the podcast zhen how are youzhen wang good i’m doing well toddtodd so i’d like to kickoff and just give the audience you know some background on you kind of what you did before you got to cheese and kind of what brought you to where you are today so go ahead and introduce yourself to the audiencezhen yeah hi everyone my name is zhen wang and currently cofounder at cheese so prior to cheese and it’s considered a startup i was in mainstream corporate i spent most of my career in ernst  young the big four accounting firm and i’ve spent about  of the eleven years in the united states market and also two years in china markets both in tax and accounting serving all of the clients little bit financial but not quite banking also had a twoyear stint with goldman sachs in new york and also in salt lake city and served on the investment finance division looking over some of the investment tax strategies with goldman sachs you know selfowned entities so that’s kind where i spent most of my life in the corporate environmentwhen i went to china for the two years as an expat with ey i had a really full understanding of the different economies the different systems and i felt that you know i wanted to empower myself into something that is more unique on the business side of it really just to continue to educate myself outside of the corporate environment and that’s why you know i wanted to do a startup for myselftodd so where did you and your cofounders come up with the idea for cheese and why launch now with your ideazhen yeah so we wanted to provide a user with some better financial solutions all our cofounders are chinese or asian immigrants and we personally experienced how difficult it is especially for immigrants in the united states and want to immerse himself in the better financial systems with different products like debit cards credit cards loans or mortgages and things like that but when you initially came over you know aside from the culture shock or the language barriers and the banking system dramatically different from where you grew up as well we saw a lot of the challenges for users to be able to enjoy and also even just to qualify at the getgo to be able to use those financial productsthat’s why we want to …initially our idea was try to help people to easily transfer funds between the home countries and here in the united states but when we did due diligence and of course one of our cofounders is heavy on the product side of it after doing some due diligence and user interviews we felt that by issuing a debt card it can also help us achieve the original idea faster but also in a more structured steps right we’re talking about operations and compliances it’s not just they build on a software or website you can you know get in we’re all users it’s a slightly different environmenttodd we’ll move to kind of a little bit more focus on what you offer but quickly what are some of the core issues that asian consumers face so they come to america regardless of where they come from china japan whatever country…i read you know one of your cofounders was constantly rejected though he had a high credit score so what are some of those core issues that you’re looking to solve let’s say a traditional firm doesn’t you know basically offer your community and immigrants coming inzhen right the core issues that the asian consumers the asian community face with traditional banking products is a lot of the availability of the information that maybe most americans think that this is a given it’s really not known to a lot of the asian immigrants because we don’t really hear too much we might be experienced with you know banking traditional debit card or credit card product but …for example there are fees a lot of fine prints and also a lot of the time who qualifies and who does not qualify we’re not going to spend too much time trying to dig into those information it’s normally when things happen and then we get to know i guess slap on the fees that have been charged so we again wanted to help breed a healthy habit of using the banking product as a service to making sure that we bring those products and services to users without having to you know wade through different waters or different services or to spend too much time making it available to themso that’s kind of what i think where our customer segment currently are facing these type of challenges i think it’s more important to point out that although our product is tailored for asian users of course when we designed it anybody is open to use it we’re just thinking that it is more the critical for us to help the asian community and build something that is good for them and then we think that by giving something that’s good for them and for ourselves the other geographical users will be able to enjoy the same benefits hopefully we’ll find this platform useful to them as welltodd you find that it’s important that you know when a user say the asian user comes to the product that they see the founding team is also asian on top of that they also offer the language that potentially makes it easier for them to understand fine print versus you know i’m obviously an american i’ve lived here all my life i get a credit card and there’s like an  template that i don’t read and so i can imagine that’s significantly more difficult for you know the asian or whatever the immigrant community might be but also seeing someone that looks like them could also help in terms of at least give empathy towards the productzhen you’re correct now because we’re offering a financial product and a lot of the time when you come about the financial product is you also have to build in the trust factor so it deals with their money it deals with their wallets so we want to say hey we understand your pain we went through it and everything is financially compliant so with the regulators’ and what not and also we’re bringing this product to your doorstep making sure that you easily can understand what a fine print is not only do we translate all of the fine prints into english but we also provide customer services and the foreign languages as well they currently only in chinese we’re looking into korean and also hindu for india for example markets as wellyou know i think having an asian founder…while it is helpful but i don’t think that an asian founder is something that is critical i think the three of us we just kind of hit it off really well with each other kind of compliment our skill sets and that’s how we kind of came about this product of course when our team started to expand you know of course we’ll bring a lot of other talents from other different sources but i think having that initial impression might help in giving a little bit of comfort you know in terms of helping the asian community to adapt to this producttodd what are some of the…i mean you mentioned the language the debit card what are some of the other key features that you offer so that…you know you have  back on more  merchants kind of who are those merchants and some of the thinking behind offering thatzhen yeah so we have quite a few vendors to offer up to  of what we call cashback cashback is one of our main features so it kind of goes back to the asian shopping behavior of you know we wanted to save sometimes you’re saving a penny that’s a good thing it just so happened you know spending the money but at the same time being able to get the cashback and the saving at the same time so a lot of the merchants we have exclusive deals with them a lot of them actually are national brands and those are also helping in driving our initiativesi’ll give you a couple of examples i think in just a couple of weeks back we have adidas that’s on sale for  and today i was just actually looking at my phone we have some of the exclusive deal offers we’ve got some big names for example even walmart is offering  if you buy certain things online for example doordash right they’re a popular delivery store that offer a  off as well whenever you sign up so those are the merchants that we have been able to acquire through our partnership network to help us drive the mission togethertodd yeah i saw that also you guys have a cheese giveback fund tell us a little bit more about that and secondly how important is an effort like that right now obviously there has been a lot of discriminatory incidents against the asian community here in the us due to the obviously unfounded conspiracy theories and what not related to corona virus but how important is something like that not only for cheese but just generally for the communityzhen right we felt that you know in order for our community to adopt us we need to help our community to understand who we are but also help to unite our community to empower our mission and really our mission is to empower people with the financial freedom and to provide really just a banking platform to effect real improvements in where we live and how we live our lives so the giveback fund is really designed to help the local economy regardless if its businesses or it’s a nonprofit organization or any kind of educational institution we wanted to use the banking platform as a medium as a way to give real benefit back to the community aside from providing of course accessible banking to the users and rewards to our merchants we wanted to make it more of a social cause platformfor example every time there’s a user sign up that we worked on cheese will donate automatically donate  to the fund or to an organization that help benefit asian communities including individual sign ups we have sign up bonuses or cashback rewards that they can automatically donate to the asian community as well it’s just a way for us to give back to the community and to help drive the overall good cause i don’t want to get into too much of a kind of hate crimes these days it’s slightly more political then than when needed to be sometimes but to help raise awareness but also help people with businesses that are in need is one of our priorities as well todaytodd you know i’m curious yeah i’ve been to china a few times you know we used to host an event there in shanghai and a few other cities their fintech market is quite exceptionalzhen exactlytodd are there lessons that you can take from the ant financial types of the world that you can apply here in the us obviously very different markets but you know the scale the speed at which you know a lot of these companies have developed it’s really been something to watch and i’ve been there up close and i’m curious what your thoughts are on possibly replicating some of that success here in the uszhen yeah i think about what there’s  challenger banks that’s kind of popped up within the last  months or so i think most of them are actually trying to replicate if not just copying exactly what’s happening in china i wouldn’t say china china korea and japan singapore and all of those asian countries they have really brought this kind of a traditional so called banking system to a way of life it’s really no longer that we try to finish go to banking because there’s banks there and we need to get money outit’s really the banking system also called the startups and the financial institutions brought the banking to us and kind of using that thinking platform as a way of life to effect every corner of our living behavior so from daily waking up what do you want to do get coffee you know here is the coffee and where you want to buy yes of course i use this in the payment financial processes all to the way to hey i want to send my kids some tuition here we go same app same process i think if we wanted to talk about consumer technology or consumer fintech technologies personally i would believe that china is five  years ahead of how they do it in the united statestodd easilyzhen now it’s not that it’s not as simple as just developing the product because there are a lot of financial and regulatory requirements you know compliance is that school that goes around it so we are trying to demonstrate number one look the financial product could be as easy as those ones that’s in china but also in the united states with the compliance of the regulatory requirements but it cannot be done overnight you need to go one step at a time really to demonstrate ourself we’re checking our box and making sure do our own due diligence in terms of who are customers are and therefore getting more confidence with the regulatory body with our banks to open up you know different type of products to users who would otherwise not be able to enjoy those type of products in the past in the united statestodd could this super app work in the uszhen well again this is going to be more of a regulatory…when we talk about super apps you know the thing that they’re most concerned about is money laundering and of course taxes right you know it kind of goes hand in hand the super apps and the way we’re thinking about is that it will require some kind of innovation number one it will also require some high level you know heads up as far as okaying the system to open up the financial markets to the broader consumer audience to be able to embed those technologies into ittodd in the us regulatory system is not exactly the smoothest or most straightforward there iszhen right but it’s still being looked up as one of the most robust and powerful financial institution in the united states yes yestodd last question before we kind of shift a little bit you know there has been some challenger banks i talked to someone earlier today that have begun to kind of look at crypto and what you know that could potentially open up…just curious is crypto something that’s potentially on your thinking you know there’s a lot of talk about what it could do to the financial system and what it has done thus far i think we’re on our path to some sort of digital currency i just wanted to get your thoughts on thatzhen yeah you know we would love to onboard digital currencies regardless of it’s crypto or tokenized currencies but again it is a regulatory compliance challenge that whatever the government or what our banking or the financial system allow us to even do that even if they allow…what’s the timeframe that we will allow us to and also even if they allow it what are some of the degree of flexibility we can use these financial tools to enable certain transactionsso that is a…i think it is certainly possible you know tesla has already accepted bitcoin for payments of the cars but it’s just a matter of how flexible and how fluid money can be transacted either through their own payment system or through a less traditional or regular banking just to get a debit card or credit card system so that’s kind of a bigger question as to when will the regulatory compliance be open to those kind of ideas i think we’re probably not ready yet as of today but i think at a certain point we will have to catch up if let’s say one country or one company finds a good way when i say good way it’s a compliant way also the way the customer would accept you know for doing thosetodd china has been you know practically using or at least testing digital currency since  so we have to catch upzhen right right but it’s governmentsponsored it’s not just anybody who can come up with that ideatodd sure i wanted to shift a little bit you know obviously you’re growing a company you’ve raised a little bit outside capital just kind of curious how do you…we’re still in the pandemic so how do you manage you know growing a company when…i am presuming here that the entire team’s not all together at all times how is that going through zoom a lot of times ideas kind of come to life when you’re all sitting around the table maybe your eating together and all of a sudden someone thinks of something how difficult is it to kind of build through video and what we’re all going through right nowzhen yeah i think it is difficult definitely with the pandemic going on it really limits our ability to meet as a team in person since the founding of the team you know since the pandemic our team only met once as a team event even when we knew we had to kind of stay six feet apart in a really large conference room but we really felt that the pandemic kind of provide some challenges but it also made us much stronger as a team because we felt like if we can execute and we can achieve those types of milestones that we’re doing today imagine if the pandemic is over and we’re kind of coming back to do the other…i think we can do much morebut you know again the pandemic is tough on us but we also take it up as an opportunity we are a startup and also the founders have if not one multiple founder experiences and we kind of understand challenge is going to come at anytime it could be different challenges we just have to keep our heads down and go through it at the end of it we wanted to build a really better team a really solid team with a solid product offerso we have teams of course very functional teams and we task each team with responsibilities in the product technology and me on the corporation finance and compliance set of it and our ceo is specifically strong on the growth side of it so it’s really each team leading a different unique effort and we’re moving that together as a really well oiled… we call it vehicle or tanktodd how helpful is it that …you mentioned your team members have been in startups before …how helpful is it that it’s kind of not there for it to run through and they’ve been through some ups and downs and you know sometimes first time founders or first time startups think everything’s going to be kind of this…all of a sudden this hockey stick growth and kind of just curious how helpful that might be for youzhen yeah i think there’s no formula as far as saying you know if i had gone through three startups the next startup is going to be a breeze i think it’s always going to be different we’re still seeing some hockey stick types of movement in terms of user behavior today now that we’re live but having had previous startup experiences definitely helped especially when we have sort of…personally i have one startup that didn’t go well when i was back in  that really helped me understand where my unique strengths are and also what my weaknesses are and also helped us to understand when you wanted to talk to an investor what they are looking at and what they are not looking or what they want to hear versus what they don’tbut more importantly you know every startup is about bringing a product to market and also finding the right product market fit and there’s a very unique process to it so having those kind of experiences definitely…i wouldn’t say gave us a golden path to success but it really helped us to avoid some common pitfalls along the way so it saves us some time and save us some resource and effort and hopefully will help us reduce the speed in our fall for the product to go to market yestodd i saw you raised some outside capital you know with the investor acceptance of the idea and your concept how was that was there a big push back in terms of hey this is maybe too niche of an idea just kind of curious how investors were taking the concept in you know not to name any names just kind of more broadly thinkingzhen yeah so we went through two rounds of investment so far in the first round it was extremely or specially difficult or challenging because you know at that time while we had what we called credentials in the past but it’s not going to make us famous which type of financials so people would have to believe us at that time based on our powerpoint slides  pages ten pieces of paper and you get the term sheets so those were the most difficult time because we were trying to convince every single investor that we came across to say hey this is a doable idea but it really took one investor who really believed in us once we have that one we were able to leverage and get our first round of funding we had over about five or six investors kind of pool the fund together for the first roundand then we really built upon our initial vision and basically we laid out a plan of this is exactly what we’re going to do and how we’re going to use the money so the second round of funding when it comes about is really just a demonstration how we are improving ourselves and how we are reflecting ourselves upon the first tranche of ideas and to show the second batch of investors and say look this is exactly what we are implementing it is still early in the product stage but you know you should be able to have confidence in us as far as building the product to the next step it’s not easy you know maybe…i think every startup founder who had to raise money or have not raised money will know that trying to convince to convince an investor to put in a million or anywhere near a million dollars in your business is going to be very very difficulttodd funny someone who’s outside from the outside looking in and who follows the news as closely as i do you see these giant rounds of funding plaid i think had  million today last week there was a mexican digital bank that raised  million series a it’s not that easy thoughzhen it’s not that easy and it doesn’t come very often we also have banks or neobanks that have to close it down have to shuffle their customers to a different platform as well we tend to hear the good news not the bad news sometimes but at a certain point it’s going to be datadriven and it’s also going to be the mission that we’re driving atyou know to a point todd earlier is that we are focused on the asia market so this socalled identity driven neobanking some might not like it because this thing that we’re focusing on is too niche of an area but the other investors are very particular and very focused on investing in a business that are…what we call identitydriven business let it be banking or like the other type of social media what not because when we look at our segment of users we look at you know some of the financial matrix in terms of their spending power their savings you know also their behaviorsso they represent actually what we call “lifetime value” or high net worth of individuals within the united states who have good jobs have steady income and spend big ticket on houses cars and also kind of daily living expenses what not so it definitely has a lot of the unique advantage to you know chimes or dave the current type of banking customers i think that’s what really caught some of our investors’ eyes next step is really be able to execute on our original vision and bring the product to broader use casestodd you mentioned it earlier i think there’s been about  neobanks in the last  months they all can’t go after the same customer they can’t all just be replications of chime and so finding different you know slices of the market whether it be the asian community i talked to someone earlier today they’re focused on the black community there’s hispanicdriven banks i mean it’s not a bad thing to bring banking to a community that’s not served well by either the traditional banking ecosystem or even by you know the fintech ecosystemzhen you’re correct you’re correct and that will also mean that you know the founding team or the implementation team has enough knowledge of this identitydriven demographic we being asian we kind of understand where we came from and how our users think so that’s why i think our unique advantage is we want to target the asian community first rather than to target you know the african american or the hispanic communities not that we don’t want to target them but i think if we can demonstrate that we can focus better and do really well with our asian community first i think we will also give…knowing ourselves but also our investors a lot more confidence to expand to a different geographytodd you know we have a few minutes left here i want to end with a little bit of fun just curious what was the last book that you read and your favorite bookzhen well to be honest maybe i’m the different kind of individual i hate reading bookstodd laughs that’s okayzhen the last book i read from start to finish was when i was back in college where i had to read a book for the classestodd how do you consume information tell me the last podcast or tv…how do you consume infozhen another thing is i don’t really watch…not much of tv or tiktok it really has been youtube the instructional type of videos my charting power myself with you know things that i know or don’t know are through instructional video because to me that’s just a more effective way to visualize it and to digest it and also to reflect i read little articles or news just to supplement what i learned but overall i don’t just grab a book and drink some coffee on the side and read the whole day longtodd i mea everyone consumes information differently there’s a lot of people i know that will listen to podcast after podcast and don’t read at all the good thing about today is that there’s plenty of different mediums to learn from without just picking up a paper or a book of whatzhen that’s righttodd curious not sure is you’re a sports fan but if you are do you have a favorite sport and sport teamzhen yeah you know everybody in china grew up knowing soccer ping pong or basketball kind of the three major sports that we follow yeah i grew up playing soccer as well but at a certain point in my junior career i picked up tennis i’m actually a uspta certified professional tennis coachtodd wowzhen i kind of play regularly and i also use tennis as a way to you call it vent right you know we’re stressful enough in the kind of daily grind so i use tennis to balance my life and just kind of stay…just to take my mind off of the startup just for a little bit and come back to it and it has really suited me well from balancing life to family and work and also kind of the overall health physical and mental health from that standpoint if there’s kind of a local team that’s playing the dodgers playing the lakers playing now the la rams i really don’t think that the la rams…so i’m always rooting for the local teamtodd so who’s better nadal federer or djokoviczhen personally my style of playing is more of a rafa nadal and he is by far still the number one kind of individual who has the most grassland titles so far actually i’m on the same age as nadal but when i started picking up tennis that’s when federer fairly started to become famous so i kind of have followed him almost stalked him literally watching his videos analyzing his strokes and things like that i think this really helped me develop a habit of you know i guess watching a video and learn stuff from somehow that’s much better than me yeahtodd yeah i remember watching some of the  federernadal matcheszhen oh yeahtodd those were some of the best i’ve seenzhen yestodd i’ll end with this one your biggest inspiration in lifezhen i think this probably goes you know i will say maybe  or  years back my family has always been in the service industry and when i went to byu…by the way i see your fighting irish at the background i guess you’re a notre dame fan so the byu church had always had a profound impact on me so when i first entered the school there’s a language on the school board that says enter to learn go forth to serve so that has really kind of been residing in my whole entire education and also my professional life you know kind of a tying back really for everything that i have doneit’s really in the service industry even cheese we’re serving our underserved customers and we wanted to equip ourselves…you know i think everybody can help anybody anytime but i think we wanted to equip us with better businesses with better information and resources to help serve this community much better on a much bigger scale that’s why i think cofounding cheese is a good inspiration in my life to both challenge ourselves and also reward ourselves in that area and also to help the customer that we’re trying to servetodd well zhen i really appreciate your joining the show i think it was really fantastic conversation i had some fun you know i wish you your cofounders the company the best hopefully you guys continue to grow at your current pace and i have one of your cofounders at our upcoming event in late april so looking to have qing at that event thank you very much for joining mezhen yeah thank you todd nice to meet you againtodd you toomusicyou know being able to articulate terms of a product can go a long way many nonenglish speakers pay higher fees because they don’t understand the fine print cheese has built a product that clearly explains the offering in multiple languages and they have more languages coming soon you know i thought zhen had some fascinating things to say about the lessons learned from the big chinese fintechs and i think we’re all headed in the future with digital currencies so i really hope everyone enjoyed listening to the show and we’ll see you again here soon bye
