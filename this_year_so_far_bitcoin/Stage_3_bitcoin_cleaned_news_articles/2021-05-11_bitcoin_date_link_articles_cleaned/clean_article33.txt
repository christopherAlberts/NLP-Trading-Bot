advertiser disclosure at slickdeals we work hard to find the best deals some products in our articles are from partners who may provide us with compensation but this doesn’t change our opinionswhen discussing cryptocurrency bitcoin is likely the first digital token to come to mind however there are plenty of other cryptocurrencies worth knowing about from the secondlargest currency ether to the meme that’s turned people into millionaires dogecoin these are some of the most noteworthy and influential currencies to know about todaywhat are cryptocurrenciesbefore digging into each currency below it’s important to understand how cryptocurrencies work cryptocurrencies are a form of digital currency tracked online using a technology called blockchain when someone buys or transfers a cryptocurrency the transaction is recorded publicly by many different computers making the digital coins nearly impossible to hackif you’re looking to buy cryptocurrency you’ll need an account with an exchange like etoro or blockfi you may also want an additional cryptocurrency wallet to keep your coins safe and sound with offline cold storagewhile bitcoin btc is by far the biggest digital currency with a market cap of more than  trillion as of this writing there are plenty of other interesting coins with varying market caps and use cases these are all  cryptocurrencies by market cap that are either among the biggest or most interesting at least in this author’s opinion in the marketplace todaytypes of cryptocurrency beyond bitcoinethererum ethbinance coin bnbripple xrptether usd

cryptocurrency with a market cap of over  billion in addition to the star of the show the ether coin the ethereum blockchain enables smart contracts decentralized apps dapps and other currenciesstory continuesethereum launched in  and runs as an opensource blockchain it is the defacto alternative to bitcoin for people who want to hold cryptocurrency but are not quite “into” crypto the big downside is that as of now ethereum transactions can be quite expensive the ethereum  network is rolling out slowly and should lower “gas” prices while improving the currently unimpressive network speedbinance coin bnbbinance coin is the official currency of the binance exchange which operates both international and us platforms to comply with various regulatory requirements i was actually a little surprised when preparing this article to see that it has grown to be the thirdlargest cryptocurrency with a market cap of around  billionearn here’s how to earn bitcoin with your everyday spendingbnb coin is used for trading and paying fees on the binance exchange it also works for credit card payments and some other limited uses binance coin lives on the ethereum blockchain these are called  tokens binance uses strategies to ensure the coin is a finite resource that will ideally become more valuable over timeripple xrpripple is the fourthlargest cryptocurrency with a  billion market cap but you shouldn’t necessarily rush and add xrp to your portfolio even if you want to buy xrp it has fallen under government scrutiny in the united states and was blocked by many exchangeshowever ripple labs stands behind its coin and continues to litigate against the sec for offering an unregistered security to the public xrp transactions are fast and secure but you should probably wait until the government decides the fate of the coin and company before buying intether usd usdttether usdt is a cryptocurrency that’s tied exactly to the us dollar at any given time one usdt should equal one usd as of now the market cap of usdt is  billion usdt is frequently used to buy and sell other currencies without changing back into true dollars in a bank accounttether is also the center of some scrutiny as some believe they don’t store  or an equivalent of other currencies to keep the value of tether stable some say the company behind tether worked to manipulate the price of bitcoin using usdt as a mechanism while all seems okay right now i personally wouldn’t hold any assets in usdtcardano adacardano is a newer currency that quickly jumped to the sixthlargest of any crypto with a  billion market capitalization cardano is another proofofstake blockchain where many computers track the owner of every coin anonymously ada is engineer and developercentric which makes the cardano blockchain popular for a range of usesaccording to many crypto investors cryptocurrencies with an actual use case beyond “fun” are most likely to succeed in the long run it empowers smart contracts its own coin and other use casesdogecoin dogehere’s the fun one dogecoin was founded as a joke and turned into a somewhat serious currency it has gone on a roller coaster ride partially fueled by elon musk tweets and currently holds a market cap of nearly  billiondogecoin is highly speculative as there’s no real use case behind it however i got on the rocket train and put a little of my own money in doge around the time of the gamestop stock craze because it’s so speculative it’s best to avoid putting more into dogecoin than you can afford to lose in fact that’s a good rule to follow with cryptocurrency in generalpolkadot dotpolkadot is another of the newer currencies and has a total market value of about  billion polkadot was designed with security and scalability in mind a challenge with larger blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum polkadot is also designed to be upgraded without a hard fork splitting a currency to branch out into a better faster version of the same blockchaincoins that are fast and highly usable like polkadot have performed well thus far that makes me believe it will continue to grow in the future it’s only the eighthbiggest cryptocurrency right now but i would keep an eye on this one for the futureuniswap uniuniswap is another  token that runs on the ethereum blockchain uniswap is designed to manage smart contracts and converting between different cryptocurrencies uniswap just launched in  but it’s well supported and run by a crack team of developersuniswap aims to be an alternative to coins like bnb and coinbase’s usdc it’s a decentralized currency that’s exchange agnostic and doesn’t tie you to any one providerlitecoin ltclitecoin is one of the og cryptocurrencies and rounds out the top  with a  billion market cap early on litecoin was an exciting third choice to bitcoin and ethereum that worked faster hence the name while it has maintained a high ranking in the cryptocurrency world overall it’s been overtaken by some newer and more exciting currencieslitecoin was created as a fork copy of the original bitcoin code but changed limits and block generation times to push coins worldwide more rapidly while ltc roughly followed the price of btc early on these days the prices are not well correlatedbitcoin cash bchbitcoin cash is one of the biggest hard fork successes in cryptocurrency bitcoin cash branched off from the original bitcoin blockchain bitcoin cash spun off from btc in  it has since split twice more creating bitcoin sv and bitcoin abcit seems bitcoin cash is a fun way to see the number of coins you hold double with so many forks though the market value probably won’t change much right away when the split happens it’s another distributed ledger designed to be faster than bitcoin as of now there are a total of  billion of bch in circulationstellar lumens xlmstellar lumens ranks as the  biggest cryptocurrency with an  billion market cap i’m personally a big fan of xlm as transactions take place almost immediately and at a meager costthe nonprofit stellar development foundation supports stellar xlm is used for international payments and even supports cell phone time tracking for a south african phone company it’s also involved with the ukrainian government in building a new governmentbacked cryptocurrency for the former soviet republiceos eoseos is the  largest cryptocurrency with a  billion market cap eos is noteworthy as a technology that can power many other decentralized apps eos aimed to fix scalability and flexibility problems that came with older blockchainsi recently noticed eos is the blockchain behind upland’s real estate trading game among many other use cases we’re getting into smaller and therefore more risky currencies however i think this is another one to watchtezos xtzthere’s a total of  billion in tezos in circulation if you have an account at coinbase you may have noticed an interest rate is paid when for staking storing coins in a crypto account at coinbase that’s encouragement for the ecosystem to grow going forwardtezos has seen some ups and downs after a successful ipo followed by a series of lawsuits but things seem to have settled down and the currency looks to have a bright future as of nowalgorand algoalgorand is another stakeable currency on coinbase and has a market cap of around  billion algorand is designed for financial applications including services for large financial institutions again because this coin has a good use case it’s more likely to succeedalgorand focuses on performance and scale for its algo coin smart contracts and other usesbasic attention token batbasic attention token isn’t all that big in the scheme of crypto it ranks no  with a  billion market cap what’s fun about bat and why i added it to this list is the main use case bat is used to run an advertising platform for users of the privacycentric brave browserthe ad ecosystem pays both publishers and web users in bat for using its platform that’s right you can get free crypto for the advertisements baked into the brave browser google never paid you to use chrome so bat along with much better privacy features is a good incentive to switchshould i buy all of these cryptocurrenciesfor most people cryptocurrencies are still a speculative and risky investment option most people are clearly focused on market leaders bitcoin and ethereum but these other coins can give you some diversification in your crypto portfolioremember these may double triple or more in value but they could also go down to zero invest cautiously and pick your coins care to ensure you’re on the right track for your cryptocurrency goalsrelated financial offerswin biggest bank bonuses right now cash promos for new deposit accountsearn
