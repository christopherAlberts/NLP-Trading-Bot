facebook ceo mark zuckerberg dropped a pretty big personal tidbit on tuesday via the social platform he has a goat named bitcoin his other goat who was also featured is named max of course with the internet being the internet the rumor mill has been working overtime to figure out what if anything these goat names might meanone popular theory is that zuckerberg was using the names of his goats to reveal that he is a bitcoin maximalist another suggestion was that he will be announcing bitcoin holdings at facebook’s annual shareholder meeting on may  and this goat post was a hint zuckerberg has yet to offer any explanation so the internet will likely continue coming up with its own theoriesthere is one thing the internet can agree on however and that is the hope that bitcoin and max don’t end up as dinner remember that time he went a whole year where he only ate animals that he had killed himself  hopefully that’s not the future for these two adorable goats
