one of the biggest arguments in favor of using bitcoin cryptobtc as either a method of payment or a store of value is that its scarce but what does that mean exactly in this fool live video clip recorded on march  senior analyst john rotonti and motley fool deutschland lead analyst bernd schmid discuss how many bitcoins there are in existence and what investors should know about the supply of the cryptocurrencyjohn rotonti can you discuss the scarcity factor arent there like a maximum number of bitcoins allowedbernd schmid yesrotonti why does that matter how does that factor inschmid the software essentially that i was mentioning in the very beginning which all these notes this network is running this has defined there will be  million bitcoins created and then it will be finished they are created by this mining process i described earlier every time you mine a new block is being created which happens on average every  minutes  new bitcoins are being created theres an algorithm which reduces this number every four years more or less until i think its in about  years when no more bitcoins are going to be mined this will be when you reach the  million bitcoin and thats it so why is this important or why is this the deal i think right now the main deal about it is that this is the argument for people saying look this is something scarce something which is scarce has a certain value look at gold the amount of new gold that is being dug out of the ground every year is about  of the gold that has been dug out of the ground historically it is relatively scarce actually theres somebody under the pseudonym planb who has created a model its called stocktoflow a stocktoflow is what i just described how much stock do you have and how much flow of new supply is coming in for gold this would be  per year i think for silver its in the  range for bitcoin the  bitcoin per block it actually amounts also to about what gold is right now  per year and people ascribe value to it i think this was a long story i couldve made it shorter but to bring the point home is people use this as an argument look this is scarce this has value theres a finite supply of it you cannot just create it out of thin air like us dollars thats why its useful buying that you will later hear i think today if you listen to michael saylor of microstrategy he will i think bring home this point
