it’s true ecological catastrophes systemic pollution and the inefficiencies that create them are a major problem people obviously do not want to live amid a toxic wasteland and the quality of human life gets better relative to the cleanliness of the ecosystem in which they live if the world became too toxic we could not live and that would be… well… badhowever the benefits of industry have been a net positive for humanity as a whole creating efficiency in the ways we eat sleep travel and grow as a species due to industrial processes we are much more able to focus on arts culture charity and civics industry has solved most of the globe’s basic needs and continues to do so with greater efficiency in places where freedom flourishesso a return to nonsystematic preindustrial agrarianism is a romantic idea in some ways but is ultimately undesirable because too much of the world would starve to death and the other costs would largely outweigh the benefits however in the face of the bull run and nft boom environmentalist activists have once again targeted bitcoin’s industrial infrastructure for criticism based on the assumption that proof of work for building blocks is a waste of electricityis bitcoin a wasteful use of energyof course not every system has financial and ecological costs but how many systems are measuring practical roipeople focus on bitcoin’s consumption but not visa’s for example have you considered what bitcoin can create per kilowatt compared to what the centralized economy can do with the same kilowatt all systems have consumption which is repurposed in the attempt to create extra value so that efficiencies can be sold to the world in order to make profit but the real question should be if there’s more profit to be made by using bitcoin as a tool for efficiency rather than other existing solutionsthe bitcoin protocol is already more efficient than visa at a very fundamental level so why aren’t we measuring bitcoin’s value per kilowatt the reason is that btc is the most wellknown implementation of a bitcoinstyle network and obsolete protocols like ethereum take up the rest of the mental bandwidth of the blockchain economy both networks are massively and arbitrarily inefficient but they are popular due to the asymmetry in information available in the marketbut that is a side note because the current mainstream economy relies on massive data centers that are incredibly power hungry too they function as a product of the indirect incentives to maintain internet infrastructure as the backbone of the modern economy and they use power which people just accept as a baseline to maintain their standard of living they do this because electricity consumption relative to economic output is extremely difficult to measure and the incentive to be “greener” is something of a mixed bagsince the metrics are all wrapped up in complicated math they are easily forgottenhow is bitcoin greenbefore computers power consumption relative to overall profit was considered a fixed cost because it was difficult to change and even more difficult to measure precisely so a business plan may only consist of estimated costs versus estimated revenue and entrepreneurs would attempt to balance them out to make some profits if things worked business chugged along but the incentive to increase something like power efficiency wasn’t really perceivable for industrial consumers who were innately competitive but not often cooperative before bitcoin most industries only had marginal incentives to cooperate with their competitors at all without layers of inefficient bureaucracy getting in the waybitcoin changed this for the first time in world history the best competitor would be held in perfect balance with his ability to be the best cooperator while also having a direct and calculable incentive to find proximity to the most efficient source of power in the worldthis has had three major effectshonest nodes huddling near sources of cheap power an exponential increase in efficiency of computer technology specializing in the creation of the supercomputer inherent in bitcoin an incredible amount of cooperative research into efficient power generation and recyclingwithout bitcoin there is far less financial incentive to be more efficient with power in computation and value transfer and when incentives are low things stay the same people needed incentives and gamification of the race to be more efficient in the use of power bitcoin created that incentive and the world is beginning to reap the benefits as industrial miners recycle power into green houses and research new ways of generating power altogetheras bitcoin absorbs an increasing share of the centralized economy the inefficiency of poorly coordinated networks will give way to the efficiency of much more closely coordinated production of value that bitcoin offersimagine the day when the infrastructure of visa mastercard paypal venmo ach swift fedwire western union moneygram and everyone else has been replaced with bitcoin not only does the world benefit from instant payments  settlement times and instant proof of all activity but it does so with the incredibly small and efficient carbon footprint of the honest nodes of bitcoinbut isn’t bitcoin consuming too much powerno but btc is  bitcoin’s mining algorithm hashing power is being wasted on btc by fools and scammers chasing a juicy block subsidy under the auspices of increased security hash power is around alltime highs and consumes absurd amounts of energy while the network can only handle six megabytes per hour plus the difficulty on btc is actually a security concern if a significant number of mining machines were to be suddenly turned off the network would be unable to find a block—effectively grinding the network to halt since btc nodes are poorly connected largely behind tor and towing a fragile political line in places like china such an occurrence on btc is plausibleso yes btc is extremely inefficient and wastefulhowever in stark contrast bitcoin sv which shares global  availability is capable of practically limitless financial transactions and valuable data per hour and due to its more competitive nature opens up more specialized transaction processing business models instead of raw competition for block rewards bsv creates opportunities to use a small amount of hash rate while providing valueadded services such as high connectivity data services asymmetric computation or critical storage of archival data so for a fraction of the cost bitcoin sv can process several orders of magnitude more payments and data across the globe and that’s the real pointwe don’t need four credit card companies thousands of banks dozens of regional and international settlement rails and  “cryptocurrencies”bitcoin sv can truly replace all of the payment rails of the world eliminate the need for unmeasurable power consumption and put direct incentives in place to make sure that no arbitrary waste exists in the entire global economy all the while providing near perfect identity solutions property rights management secure personal and business data and integrating physical and digital lifestyles seamlessly on the blockchainthis is a goal worth pursuing for the sake of the planet and for the sake of profit and that’s what will make important things truly get done on all fronts so next time you are looking for a green tech solution to all of the world’s problems start with bitcoin sv it’s the only tool that can replace everythingnew to
