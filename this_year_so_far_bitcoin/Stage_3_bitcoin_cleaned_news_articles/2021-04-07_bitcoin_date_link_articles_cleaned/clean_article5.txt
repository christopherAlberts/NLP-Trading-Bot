stanislav kozlovski walks us through the most important events for bitcoin in the first quarter of gradually then suddenlyit is the way that hemingway penned the process of going bankrupt first comes a series of incremental steps which bring you closer to bankruptcy until reality hits you and a sudden realization of what has occurred dawns upon youthis process can be thought of as a universal one it applies to many things in life like achieving success declining health or the onceinalifetime emergence of a brandnew asset classacross the “gradually then suddenly” spectrum bitcoin is inching closer and closer to the “suddenly” part—and this quarter is an immaculate example of thatin this piece we will provide a short overview of all the bitcoin news in the first quarter of  let’s dig incorporate treasury adoptionhighprofile companies continued to accumulate bitcoin in their treasury with square buying  million worth of btc and microstrategy performing the carry trade of the decade by taking out a  billion bond loan at  interest to buy bitcointhe biggest splash this quarter was made by tesla’s surprise bitcoin investment when they put  billion  of their cash holdings into bitcoin started accepting bitcoin payments for their cars promising to not convert the proceeds into fiat and to top it off contributed an important security patch to the opensource ecosystem’s btcpay server project just like that the company owned by the world’s richest man established itself as a bitcoin ally—from zero to  in less than a quarterother smaller publicly traded companies also piled on marathon invested  million seetee with  million and meitu with  million it is reasonable to assume that more companies are accumulating bitcoin but do not plan to announce it one such example is a new zealand retirement fund which had allocated  percent to bitcoin back in october  but was only recently reported or german company synbiotic which did not disclose its holdings just the intention to shift free capital into btca survey showed that  percent of finance executives plan to hold btc this year which is certainly a much larger number than the handful of organizations that have publicly announced holdings so farfinancial institution supportlike a set of dominos every financial institution seems to be scrambling to announce support for bitcoin as their competition is rushing to do the same resulting in a whirlwind of announcementsbank of new york mellon the world’s largest custodian with  trillion assets under management aum and the us’ oldest bank announced that it will offer custody for digital assets like bitcoina day after news broke about the sixth largest european bank—deutsche bank—prototyping its own digital custody platform and aiming to roll out a minimum viable product in then news started flooding ineven popular payment networks rushed to announce support for digital assetsmastercard announced that they plan to integrate cryptocurrencies into their networkvisa announced support for usd coin to be used to settle transactions on its payment network admittingly on the ethereum blockchain this is a large step forward for the industry it is not a stretch to imagine them extending support for lightning ceo al kelly mentioned that they are working on enabling bitcoin purchases on visa credentialspaypal launched a new service that allows us customers to seamlessly use bitcoin as payment to the company’s  million merchants while also signaling a desire to move into custody with their recent acquisition of curvsmaller banks around the world are also converging on bitcoin support just not making the news for example a small private german bank donner  reuschel which has been in business for  years is offering cryptocurrency buying and custody or blue ridge bank which became the first us commercial bank to provide branch atm access to bitcoin at its atms allowing people to purchase directly from their atmsinstitutional interestinstitutions continued to show interest for the asset throughout  with blackrock the world’s largest asset manager admitting it started to dabble in bitcoin and soros fund management implying that they already own bitcoincanada made headlines earlier this year with the approval of north america’s first bitcoin etf purpose’s bitcoin etf has amassed over  million  billion canadian dollars of assets under management so far beating canada’s largest gold etf which is at approximately  million  billion aum this product also broke the canadian record for firstday trading volumes of an etf by trading  the average firstday volume of an average canadian etf soon after canada saw two more bitcoin etfs evolve and ci galaxy and is on track to have up to five etfs with – billion – billion in aummeanwhile over in the united states the sec is drowning in bitcoin etf applications a usbased bitcoin etf seems imminent there are six firms that have filed applications to the sec proposing bitcoin etfs that either track and hold the underlying asset directly or have more indirect exposure through funds which invest in bitcoin as of writing the firms who have applied are fidelity goldman sachs nydig skybridge capital valkyrie and cboeto scour the full continent south america also approved its first etf in brazil and is set to go live in summer a view of the world in just as we were all ready to take a break from  this year proved to be just as dynamicit all started with the capitol riots and massive censorship of sitting president of the united states donald trump where several highprofile internet platforms acted in a coordinated fashion to completely remove him from the mainstream internet with some banks also announcing they would stop doing business with him regardless of your political views this massively unprecedented event sent shocks throughout the world by exposing the scary power that these centralized platforms have it only goes to show that a censorshipresistant and permissionless currency is desperately needed in a world which can erase even the most prominent figure in a matter of dayscountries burdened with inflation and a failing currency saw their bitcoin interest skyrocket with google searches for bitcoin in argentina reaching peak popularity  percentplus growth and a spike in turkey where their currency lost  percent purchasing power in a single day bitcoin seems to be heavily favored compared to gold in such burdened countries consistently surpassing gold’s google search volume in venezuela and nigeriain a world which seems broken everything seemingly continues to head downhill broad money supply was already set to increase  percent year over year just from the current planned federal reserve purchases  billion a month when the international monetary fund imf urged every country to take on more debt and “spend as much as it can”this advice was seemingly taken as the united states signed a  trillion stimulus package followed up by immediately announcing a newly planned  trillion plan for rebuilding infrastructure modern monetary theory is in full effect as the federal reserve is set to own more us treasuries than foreigners any minute nowas always inflation numbers are unlikely to reflect what’s actually happening as official numbers can rarely be trusted the federal reserve’s chairman jerome powell asserts this belief as he publicly states that the real unemployment rate is closer to  percent compared to the officially stated one of  percent if a government official cannot trust the publicly reported numbers how can an average citizenfear uncertainty and doubtit all started with this anonymously published fearprovoking article about tether’s alleged instability which might have scared some investors temporarily but ultimately culminated with tether finally settling their case with the new york attorney general and promising to issue quarterly reports of what’s backing the stablecointhis quarter we saw many government officials speak about bitcoin from europe’s christine lagarde accusing bitcoin of being involved in “funny business” and the united states’ janet yellen suggesting curtailing use because cryptocurrencies are mainly used for “illegal financing” both of these statements are provably false by chainanalysis’ latest report which found that the criminal share of all cryptocurrency activity in  was just  percentlater us officials began presenting the energy narrative talking about how bitcoin is “extremely inefficient” how it uses a “staggering amount” of energy and continued to speak condescendingly about it with the federal reserve’s jerome powell implying it is as useless as goldit is likely that officials are scared of the asset as they know that banning it is futilehistory this quarter including has proven that countries cannot outright ban bitcoin they can only temporarily ban their citizens from participating in the network some countries like nigeria realized this inevitability and backtracked on their previous ban within a month after announcing itwhile noisy this year did not bring any new content with relation to fud rather it simply recycled old content that has long been debunked despite the unoriginal negative press this quarter we saw many people write very eloquently and positively about bitcoin in particular about its energy useworthy mentions include stone ridge’s annual letter which changed many people’s minds about how ecofriendly bitcoin mining is and can grow to be later seetee followed up with a letter from its billionaire norwegian founder citing similar arguments both letters were certain that bitcoin will enable many more renewableenergy projects than otherwise would be possible mainly due to miners’ locationindependent naturebalaji srinivasan also wrote an extensive piece about how india would be smart in canceling its proposed bitcoin ban and embracing the technology directly going as far as to exhaustively describe what they should actually doregulationssome probitcoin us politicians established key positions in the government like cynthia lummis who joined the banking committee former td ameritrade head of digital assets sunayna tuteja was named us federal reserve chief innovation officer and gary gesler who has taught a blockchain course in mit is nominated for leading the secthere was mixed news regulationswise as we started the year with the fincen proposal that had an unreasonably short comment period of  days over the holiday season the onslaught of comments from the community made it so that they had to considerably extend it with the new biden administration significantly extending the comment period by some  daysthroughout that period there was a very positive regulatory change of the comptroller of the currency occ providing guidance in having banks participate in public blockchain systems as another form of settlement infrastructure like swift and achfurther kentucky signed a bill into law that incentivizes bitcoin mining in the state by allowing for tax exemptions on property and electricity used in miningmiami the hosting city of the bitcoin  conference proved to capture attention in the bitcoin space with the prolific mayor francis suarez actively engaging with the industry through twitter and inperson meetings with famous bitcoin proponents like the winklevoss twins suarez has also publicly pushed back on some of the negative comments from janet yellen and has said to be actively exploring investing part of the city’s treasury into bitcoin he said that they are procuring a vendor to offer employees to get a percentage of their salary in bitcoin allow miami’s residents to pay for fees in bitcoin potentially also allow taxes to be paid in bitcoin and rumours say they’re working on giving mining incentives to attract investmentthe city which is aiming to become the crypto capital of the world even hired a chief technology officer for the first time everwith all this positive news there was bound to be some negativity the intergovernmental financial action task force consisting of nonelected officials formed illdetailed crypto regulatory guidelines with the risk of the current interpretation prohibiting kycfree use of decentralized networksinvestmentsthroughout  the bitcoin industry continued to see a large amount of investmentscapitulationsthroughout bitcoin’s history many pundits have openly dismissed the asset while bitcoiners have always seen their incompetence through the fallacy in their argumentsin a petty battle between norwegian billionaires øystein stray spetalen was quick to reverse course after seeing the other norwegian billionaire kjell inge røkke’s company seetee buy  million worth of bitcoin in a conference in early march  he expressed his negative views about bitcoin but just a couple of weeks later he realized he was wrong and bought somemany previously outspoken opponents of bitcoin reversed course this quarter like the motley fool which capitulated and bought  million worth of bitcoin or all of the large bankswe’ve seen hugely respected names in the investment industry turn from skeptic to lukewarm like howard marks who initially called bitcoin a pyramid scheme only to admit this year that he did not understand it ray dalio has been trekking across the spectrum as well most recently scheduled to speak at two crypto conferences texas am bitcoin conference inapril  and consensus in may bitcoin has the power to convert even the most faithful gold believers like longtime gold bull jeffrey gundlach who turned neutral on his views on gold and the dollar admitting bitcoin may be the better bet which is no surprise considering the bank of singapore implied the same thing in a research noteretail interest has been rekindled over the quarter as well with many exchanges recording alltime high traffic and bitcoinrelated social media seeing parabolic growthrbitcoin subreddit subscribed growth source httpssubredditstatscomrbitcoinconclusionin the same way that people never notice the “gradually” part of bankruptcy and are left struggling with solutions once the “suddenly” part hits today’s market participants are scrambling to establish their position in this new bitcoin world be it as a service provider investor or anything inbetweenwhile the flurry of news can certainly seem like we are in the “suddenly” part of the spectrum it is worth taking a step back observing the bigger picture and realizing we still have a long way to gotoday bitcoins market cap is roughly  percent of golds market cap a fivetime jump from where it was in may  but still a far cry away from its first milestone of surpassing gold bitcoin’s market cap is still significantly less than the whole  trillion stimulus package that the united states printed out of thin air nevertheless since  there have been clear signs that bitcoin demand is growing incredibly fast much faster than the market demand for gold despite being worth only a small fraction of golds market capmy intuition tells me that we are still a fair amount of time away from jawdropping adoption money after all is humanity’s most valued asset as the whole world readily trades its scarcest resource time for it bitcoin is a global permissionless network consisting of the soundest money the world has ever seen any quarter which truly embodies the “suddenly” part of the market penetration of this global asset will surely not be able to fit inside a single  piecethis is a guest post by stanislav kozlovski opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of btc inc or bitcoin magazine
