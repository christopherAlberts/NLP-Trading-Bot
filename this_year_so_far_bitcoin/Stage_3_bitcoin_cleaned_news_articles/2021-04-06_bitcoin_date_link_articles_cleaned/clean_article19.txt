if you’ve yet to tune into the white house’s daily press briefings something you may not know is that they regularly feature fox news correspondent peter doocy asking inane questions that simply serve to further factfree republican talking points or complaining of discrimination because the president didn’t call on him on tuesday doocy did get to pose a question to white house press secretary jen psaki and he used his time to suggest that major league baseball shouldn‘t have moved the allstar game from georgia in protest of the state’s new highly restrictive voting law ie conservatives’ badfaith argument du jour and as is typically the case of a doocystyle inquiry psaki was having none of it“is the white house concerned that major league baseball is moving their allstar game to colorado where voting regulations are very similar to georgia” doocy asked a question predicated on bullshit to which psaki responded rhetorically stuffing the fox news correspondent in a locker “well let me just refute the first point you made first let me say on colorado colorado allows you to you register on election day colorado has voting by mail where they send to  of people in the state who are eligible applications to vote by mail  of people in colorado voted by mail in the  election they also allow for a range of materials to provide even if they vote on election day for the limited number of people who vote on election day i think it’s important to remember the context here the georgia legislation is built on a lie there was no widespread fraud in the  election georgia’s top republican election officials have acknowledged that repeatedly in interviews what there was however was recordsetting turnout especially by voters of color instead what we’re seeing here for politicians who didn’t like the outcome is they’re not changing their policies to win more votes they’re changing the rules to exclude more voters and we certainly see the circumstances as different ultimately though it’s up to major league baseball to determine where they’re holding their allstar game”doocy of course isn’t the only republican trying desperately to change the story from “georgia wants to disenfranchise black and brown voters and even corporate america is disgusted” to “corporate america should mind its own damn business” on monday senate minority leader mitch mcconnell warned that corporations should shut their traps or will suffer “consequences” for speaking out meanwhile senator tim scott has also adopted the false talking point that colorado is just as bad as georgia when it comes to voter lawsonly as cnn factchecker daniel dale notes colorado’s election laws are wildly different than georgia’s for reasons that include but are not limited to the fact thatcolorado sends ballots to every active registered voter whereas georgia voters must send away for a ballot and “the secretary of state and other officials are now banned from even sending applications to everyone”georgia requires photo ids to vote while colorado lets people use all kinds of nonphoto ids including bank statements bills checks and birth certificatescolorado keeps its drop boxes open  hours a day until the night of election day while georgia’s now must be inside are only available during early voting hours and are closed the friday before election daycolorado lets people register to vote on election day whereas the deadline in georgia is approximately five weeks before election daycolorado campaigns can give out food and drinks to people standing in line to vote as long as they‘re not wearing specific candidateparty swag georgia now prohibits giving out food or drinks to voters with  feet of the line with the exception of selfserve water set out by election staffin other words no colorado’s voter laws are not as restrictive as georgia’s—not by a long shot—and anyone arguing they are is trying to distract from the fact that georgia would prefer that only white people vote anyway be sure to tune in for the next press briefing in which doocy asks a question like “does president biden agree that the current covid crisis is his fault and his fault alone because he is the president” and psaki disembowels him on live tvif you would like to receive the levin report in your inbox daily click here to subscribe
