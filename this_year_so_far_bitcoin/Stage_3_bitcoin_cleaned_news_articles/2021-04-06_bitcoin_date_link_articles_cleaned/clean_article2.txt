at tuesdays prices bitcoin cryptobtc is up more than  in the past year and  in the past five years those are lifechanging returns  and some analysts still see big gains on the horizonfor instance investment bank jpmorgan chase said bitcoins price could hit  a massive increase from todays prices around  more recently ark invest ceo cathie wood explained how its price could climb to over  in other words theres still time for investors to cash in on cryptocurrencyhere are three reasons bitcoin could double your money and more bitcoin is powered by blockchainblockchain is the ingenious recordkeeping system behind decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to understand why that matters its necessary to know how mining worksas bitcoin transactions occur they are grouped into blocks these blocks are secured by cryptography ie complex math problems  specifically all data within a block is run through a cryptographic hash function which generates a unique signature for that block notably each blocks signature is added to the subsequent block allowing them to be linked in chronological orderminers use expensive hardware to solve these complex math problems once they find a solution it is verified by all other nodes computers on the network and then the validated block is added to the blockchainthis process is important for two reasons first when miners successfully solve the cryptographic puzzles they are awarded bitcoin as compensation  and this is the only way bitcoin can be created second by validating blocks and adding them to the blockchain miners create a ledger of all past transactionsin other words bitcoin does not need to be and cannot be controlled by any central authority there is no need for a central bank to issue new currency or keep records because the network takes care of both by itself this system is not only efficient its also very secureif anyone attempted to alter information within an existing block ie fabricate new bitcoin it would alter the output of the cryptographic hash function changing the blocks signature that means the new signature would no longer match the signature incorporated into the subsequent blockas a result the network would recognize the fraudulent change and reject it reverting to its original state in fact in order to successfully hack the bitcoin blockchain an individual would need to control at least  of all computing power on the network thats virtually impossibleso heres the takeaway blockchain is a highly secure and selfgoverning database both valuable qualities in a financial system bitcoin benefits from scarcitythe supply of bitcoin is limited to  million tokens thats because every  blocks the mining reward is cut in half currently miners receive  bitcoin for adding a block to the blockchain but eventually that figure will drop to zero after that miners will only earn transaction feesthe idea of scarcity may sound trivial but its actually critical to bitcoins longterm value according to economic theory supply and price are inversely related so if supply rises to infinity the price should fall to zero  thats the problem with cryptocurrencies that have no supply limits but if supply is held constant the price will rise as demand increases or fall as demand dropsas a practical example assets like gold have value because they exist in limited supply bitcoin has been called digital gold because it benefits from the same economic principles bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrencybitcoin was the first digital currency and it remains the most popular in fact the combined value of all bitcoin in circulation is now roughly  trillion  more than four times that of secondplace ether more to the point its realworld utility is improvingfintechs like square and paypal now allow consumers to trade bitcoin and paypal recently launched checkout with crypto making it possible to fund purchases with bitcoin likewise mastercard and visa have launched crypto payment cards which serve a similar purposethese products make one thing clear cryptocurrency is gaining popularity and bitcoin  the first and largest cryptocurrency  has an advantage over the rest going forward as more payment processors and merchants accept digital currencies bitcoin is virtually guaranteed to be their first choice which should perpetuate its popularity and drive demanda final wordinvestors should remember bitcoin is a highly volatile asset in fact it has lost over half its value several times over the last decade for instance between december  and december  the price of a token fell more than   and its possible perhaps even likely that a similar event will occur againhowever for investors who can tolerate that type of risk and volatility bitcoin could be a rewarding longterm investment
