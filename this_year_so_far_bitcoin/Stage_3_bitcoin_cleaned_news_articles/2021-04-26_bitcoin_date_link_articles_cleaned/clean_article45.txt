retrace since novemberin fundamentals miners continue to recover from a chinese power outage that truncated the network’s hash rate overnight earlier in aprilas a result of flooding as before in bitcoin’s life large segments of china’s mining power disappeared from the network leading to a drop in hash rate which at one point neared  of alltime highssince then miners have begun adapting while a drop in mining difficulty will allow smaller operators to mine more profitably and provide an incentive for maintaining network securitythis drop set to occur in around five days’ time will be the

on their choice of statistics resource and argued that the drop had not in fact been as large as some suggested“bitcoin hashrate back at  eh about  below  eh peak mostly recovered from  down at  eh” he tweeted on sundaysentiment tends toward “extreme fear”along with shorts and overleveraged longs alike it seems that irrational sentiment in crypto has finally been shaken outthat’s the conclusion of the popular crypto fear  greed index which uses a basket of factors to determine trader sentiment and therefore what’s likely to occur on btcusd as a result of their actionspreviously as new alltime highs of  appeared fear  greed was nearing historic record highs in line with the tops of bull markets pastat nearly  a selloff was clearly on the cards as per the metric which took around a week to react to the price dip down to now however the pressure is off and the index has gone from “extreme greed” to “fear” — effectively a “reset” of sentiment which provides scope for further price gainsanalyst highlights price dip “silver lining”it’s not just private individuals who have undergone a serious mood change according to other metrics erratic behavior from professional traders has also been effectively cleansed from the marketin his latest update for morgan creek digital cofounder anthony pompliano’s market newsletter on friday analyst william clemente noted that longs had once again become an attractive bet“there was some silver lining to this event greed and leverage was flushed out” he wrote“in addition to the liquidations this can be illustrated by funding rates to peg the perpetual swap contract to bitcoin spot price funding rates are used when the majority of traders go long it becomes profitable to go short and vice versa during the event funding rates flipped negative meaning it became profitable for traders to take the long side of the trade this has shown to be a buy signal in the previous two times this happened during this bull market”also approaching a “full reset” is the spent output profit ratio sopr a metric which cointelegraph previously noted tends to dictate local market bottoms“currently sopr is approaching the full reset mark meaning price has either reached or is very closing to reaching the bottom of the current correction” clemente added
