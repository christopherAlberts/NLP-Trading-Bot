history is full of companies that missed out on big technological changes many of them thought they were carefully timing their participation in the market but i believe they may have been looking at the wrong measures of adoption and consequently made the wrong decisions that pattern is about to repeat itself with blockchain the issue here is that when it comes to technology the battle over standards and market leadership is usually decided before mass adoptionthe result is that by the time most companies notice that the market is entering a massadoption phase it’s too late to change the course of the market the market for personal computers arguably started in  a decade later in  less than  of all american households had a personal computer but by then microsoft windows was the market leader with more than half the market great perspective from asymcocom here and here and herepaul brody is eys global blockchain leaderthe pattern repeated itself in the smartphone category nokia can be said to have kicked off the market with the symbian ecosystem in  emailfocused smartphones followed in  and then touchbased smartphones in  by  even though adoption was still less than about  of the market we already had the same two market leaders we know todaythe pattern appears to have largely repeated itself in the world of cloud computing and networking systems even though both markets are largely based on opensource technologies and wellunderstood published standards they remain dominated by the original leaders even after decades of determined and big spending competition the market leader in networks has a  share and the market leader in cloud has a  shareand so there is a lesson here for the world of blockchain time is running out that’s true for alternative blockchains for legacy players for everyone who isn’t already kneedeep in this business to become a serious player depending on the starting point you select bitcoin in  or ethereum in  we are seven to  years into this market development estimates vary but the more reliable ones point to between  and  of all americans already own some cryptocurrency the window to create a leadership position seems to close around  years after a market is created and so that time is near if it hasn’t already arrivedthe most astonishing aspect about market leadership in technology is how little it depends on the technology itselfjust how close we are to the end of the game can be hard to discern in the daytoday fog of competitive warfare between  and  you wouldn’t have been in bad company if you had picked up a commodore amiga as i did or an atari st in the  you were in similarly good company if you eschewed complicated touch screens for the reliability of a smartphone with keyssubscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policynot only would you have been in good company for choosing different smartphones or pcs you would have also been right in pointing out the enormous flaws in the market leaders a black and white pc in  only  kilobytes of memory the same kinds of absurdities can be found in the world of blockchain the carbon footprint for bitcoin and the transaction gas fees the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction on ethereum can only be described as obscenethese problems did not destroy their ecosystems however they got fixed often imperfectly and with much grumbling and people moved on when pcs with extended memory arrived the solution was criticized as a clumsy workaround people bought them in huge numbers anyway expect roughly the same reception to any “solution” to bitcoin’s carbon footprinti believe the dominant players in the world of blockchain are clearly visible now as well bitcoin represents a bigger market capitalization than every other blockchain combined and appears to be on track to become the preferred digital store of value likewise ethereum has more developers than every other blockchain combined and is similarly on track to becoming the preferred economic infrastructure for the next generation of developers at the same time companies like aave binance coinbase and compound labs are busy staking out the high ground in this ecosystem around specific value propositionsi’ve spent five years at ey doing everything i can to make sure that we don’t just participate in this market but that we lead it i don’t think i will know if we succeeded for another decade but i am sure that the critical time is now and i find myself struggling at times to communicate to others my intense sense of urgency in a market that many think is just in its infant stagesif there is one final reason to act with urgency it’s not just that the window for market leadership is closing it is also unlikely to reopen there were better operating systems back in  than the market leaders and that was also true in   and the most astonishing aspect about market leadership in technology is how little it depends on the technology itself there is always something better out there the strength of the platform may have started in the technology but in the end it is much more driven by the total investment the installed base and the developer communityin the next year or two you can expect many technology and financial services companies to explain their plans to enter the blockchain market in nearly every case they will cite the low penetration of the technology in their industry or market as evidence that it’s “early days yet” and they have “plenty of time” to formulate their strategy and leverage their legacy market position it isn’t they don’t
