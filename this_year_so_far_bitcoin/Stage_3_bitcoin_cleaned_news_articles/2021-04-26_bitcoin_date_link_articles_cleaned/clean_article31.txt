with an appreciation for bitcoins market cycles we can identify patterns to better gauge the progress of bull and bear markets alikebitcoin’s onchain market cyclesthis article is a collaboration by glassnode and bitcoin magazine to introduce bitcoiners to the world of onchain analysis our aim is to simplify demystify and improve access to onchain data helping you take the first steps into using these powerful new toolsbitcoin is a free market for exponential digital monetary technology it has attracted interest from all manner of investors ranging from the individual right through to global institutions number go up technology has driven both speculation and investor conviction as the thesis of digital sound money is tested challenged and ultimately proven through price performance and adoptionwithin that context bitcoin has proven to be a cyclical asset with extreme price runups and lengthy and significant drawdowns at all stages in these cycles there are pools of people buying selling holding transacting and mining within the bitcoin network to fully understand the psychology and characteristics of these market cycles there are few data sets more suitable to study than the bitcoin ledger itselfin this article we will explore some select onchain metrics that provide insight into the sentiment and macrospending patterns of hodlers speculators and miners the objective is to equip readers with the tools needed to appreciate the progress and data patterns as they relate to the current bull marketonchain characterin bear markets interest in bitcoin the protocol typically wanes and by the end of it only bitcoiners smart money and miners remain standing these are the buyers of last resort and they all have one goal to accumulate as much bitcoin as possible before everyone else works it outfor onchain data the patterns and fractals we observe during bear markets are largely driven by these low time preference accumulators the chart below shows supply accumulation by longterm holders and how it consistently peaks during the darkest timesbull markets on the other hand are a very different beast the dynamics between onchain supply and demand are in constant flux as new speculators and old hodlers compete for blockspace profitability and test their resolve to hodl through epic price rises old hands typically begin to distribute in bulls transferring their expensive coins into the hands of new speculators who return the favor in bears selling cheap coins at a loss to hodlersbitcoin realized cap hodl waves glassnodeas investors enter and exit this market they leave behind onchain footprints that capture the aggregate hodling conviction and spending patterns through study of bitcoin cycles we can establish sets of assumptions and fractals to describe the balance between supply and demand with an appreciation for market cycles and how different parties typically behave we can use these patterns to better gauge the progress of bull and bear markets alikebitcoiners and the smart moneybitcoiners and the smart money tend to have a similar modus operandi their incentive is to accumulate sats as cheaply as possible and realize profits late in the bull cycle if at all as such their total holdings grow during bear markets as sats are stacked and withdrawn to cold storagewe can observe this in the hodl waves metric as older age bands cool colors increase in thickness suggesting coins are maturing and are held by strong hands the thicker these cool bands become the more supply is owned by longterm holdersconversely as old coins are spent they are reclassified as young coins warm colors with a corresponding increase to young hodl wave thickness typically smart money coins are spent only late in the bull market and when young age bands begin to swell in size it may indicate a change in macro sentiment is underway note coins older than five to six months are usually considered hodled coinsbitcoin hodl waves glassnodethe spent output age bands provide a view on the age distribution for all coins spent that day the chart below has been filtered to show only coins older than one year indicative of hodlers we can see that these old coins tend to be spent mostly during periods of high volatility in particularin bull markets as old coins are distributed into market strengthin bear markets during capitulation events and bear market ralliesnote also how in the current bull market old coin spending has slowed down lately this suggests that fewer old coins are on the move and that conviction to hold remains strongbitcoin spent output age bands glassnodethe older a coin is the more coin days it will have accumulated and when it is spent these coin days are “destroyed” coin days destroyed cdd tracks the total sum of coin days destroyed each day we can use this metric to observe macrospending patterns and changes in behavior for longterm holderswhen bitcoiners are accumulating few old coins are spent and cdd tends to be low during latestage bull markets old coins are increasingly spent to realize profits leading to a spike in cdd applying a longterm moving average eg  can help to smooth out noise and identify these macro shifts and even approximate market tops and bottomsshortterm speculatorsit is well known that bitcoin volatility specializes in shaking out weak hands the market often rewards longterm holders who exercise patience and punishes more inexperienced market participants and late bull cycle entrants longterm holders recognize this and tend to wait for peak market hype before realizing profits on expensive coinsthis creates a cyclical transfer of bitcoin wealthas hodlers distribute coins into new hands the supply of young coins will swell in volume the realized cap hodl waves are an ideal tool for tracking this wealth transfer via the expansion of young coin supply we can see in the chart below during the late stages of the  and  bull markets the height of young coin bands warm colors spiked in three distinct instances these peaks generally corresponded with the major rallies and correctionsin the current bull market we have seen the first major spike in young coin supply what is interesting is the warmest colors youngest coins have not spiked as high this cycle this likely reflects two phenomenaincreased conviction of coin holders including new institutional buyers as the bitcoin thesis is tested and proved on the macro stage greater access for speculation via offchain derivatives leading to young coins having a smaller onchain footprintbitcoin realized cap hodl waves glassnodewith this wealth transfer in mind we can observe the proportion of old coin supply – blue and compare it to the young coin supply – orangeat the end of bear markets green zones – coin supply is at a maximum and – coin supply is at a minimum this is the hodler accumulation we discussed earlierat the end of bull markets red zones – coin supply is relatively high as more new speculators enter while – supply has declined significantly due to old coins selling into market strengthbitcoin supply last active glassnodeusing this observation we can construct the realized hodl ratio metric rhodl which takes the ratio between the – and  rhodl waves and creates a cyclical oscillator that closely tracks the macro marketthis metric describes the cyclical nature of wealth transfer eventsbull market tops occur where old hands have transferred a large portion of their wealth to new hands increasing liquid supply max new holders high rhodlbear market bottoms occur where old hands have accumulated a large portion of coins from new hands decreasing liquid supply max strong hands low rhodlbitcoin realized hodl ratio glassnodeminersfinally we take a look at proofofwork miners miners are some of the biggest bulls in the space having sunk large amounts of capital into asic hardware logistical setups and power consumption their compulsory selling of coins necessitates distribution to cover costs which are typically denominated in fiat currenciesas such observing miner incomes and hodled balances is often useful to establish a gauge for their sentiment and conviction the chart below shows the balance of miner coins since  and we can see three typical phasesdistribution and declining balances in late bull markets as miners take profits into market strength reduced distribution in a bear market as miners cut costs switch off asics or capitulate leaving room for stronger miners to gain a larger share of the hash power accumulation with increasing balances in early bull markets as miners return to profitability prices trend higher and broader market excitement around the halving kicks inbitcoin balance in miner wallets glassnodelastly we can analyze the income side of the miner equation seeking periods of profitability or income stress miners generally operate with longtime horizons given volatility in coin price miners will assess income streams using longterm averages to make economic decisionsthe puell multiple is a metric that builds off this observation taking the ratio between current miner income and its  average this creates an oscillator based on aggregate miner profitabilityhigh profitability occurs when current income is significantly above the yearly average high puell multiple in this instance miners are accumulating coins much cheaper than market price and have an incentive to sell at higher profit margins releasing additional supply into the marketlow profitability occurs when current income is significantly below the yearly average low puell multiple in this instance miners are operating under relative income stress and must eventually switch off asic rigs this generally leads to capitulation and the formation of bear market bottomsbitcoin puell multiple glassnodesummarythe supply and demand balance of the bitcoin market is an extremely dynamic system despite being cyclical in nature while the programmatic halving cycles may make it seem “obvious” it remains difficult to pinpoint which stage of the bull market we are in onchain metrics provide tools and insights into macro changes in spending patterns and conviction of hodlers speculators and minerswhen it comes to bull markets there is an array of metrics and useful indicators but a few patterns are important to pay attention tohodlers old coins distributing their wealthnew speculators young coins increasing their positionsminers reaching peak profitabilityall market cycles are unique but the human response to profit loss and incentives can be strangely predictable the trick is knowing what to look for in the data onchaindisclaimer this report does not provide any investment advice all
