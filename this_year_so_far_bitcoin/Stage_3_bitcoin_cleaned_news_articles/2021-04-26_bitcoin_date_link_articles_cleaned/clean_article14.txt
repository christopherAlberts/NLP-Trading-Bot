is there such a thing as green bitcoinelon musk and tesla’s recent purchase of  billion in bitcoin brightened the spotlight on cryptocurrency but tesla’s leadership in sustainably powered vehicles also threw into relief questions about bitcoin mining’s gargantuan consumption of electricityin the dealflow i’m seeing in my work on global infrastructure and energy for pillsbury winthrop shaw pittman llp the topic of how to green blockchain products comes up more and more oftena running tally from the university of cambridge estimates that bitcoin mining uses more energy than argentina and the power consumed rises daily because of how the bitcoin blockchain was designed and intense competition among minerssix years ago you could mine bitcoin with a standard laptop or desktop computer these days to be competitive you need a warehouse full of asics applicationspecific integrated circuits machines specially designed for the taskwhen confronted over bitcoin’s enormous power appetite its defenders point to energy wasted by christmas lights or vampire electronics that draw power when “off” the “other people are worse” argumentthey also say bitcoin mining is inherently incentivized toward efficiency since miners naturally want to pay as little as possible for power and asics are constantly being improved but this also means there’s a huge stream of asics being decommissioned and since the purposebuilt machines are not easily adapted for another purpose they contribute to the cascade of electronic hazardous wasteyou’ll hear that most bitcoin mining is powered by renewables the numbers on this tend to be fuzzy since many mining operations are migratory energy sources can change seasonally in china where some  of bitcoin mining is currently done miners set up near hydroelectric sources during the rainy season then revert to coalpowered electricityways to cut energy consumptionone way to invest in bitcoin that has a positive effect on renewable energy is to encourage mining operations near wind or solar sites this provides a customer for power that might otherwise need to be transmitted or stored saving money as well as carbonthere’s also interest in using natural gas otherwise flared from fossil fuel plants to power mining and asic development to radically reduce the energy required by the computational work keeping asics from overheating is a big part of bitcoin’s energy draw so there’s an investment opportunity in immersion mining—submerging asics in liquid instead of air coolingwith bitcoin investment opportunities appear not so much green as greenadjacent how do we surround a transformative yet energyintensive industry with ways of minimizing its footprint while maximizing the benefitscryptocurrency companies argo and dmg recently signed an agreement to launch a new bitcoin mining pool that operates exclusively on renewable energy the mining operation named terrapool will mainly use hydropowerthe world of nftsbitcoin isn’t the only hot cyberproduct nonfungible tokens or nfts are digital tokens that provide proof of ownership of a wide range of assets when a digital mural by the artist beeple sold for  million in march it shook the art world and brought nfts to public attentionwithin a week the new york times columnist kevin roose wrote a column about the nft phenomenon then made the column itself into an nft—which was auctioned within days for more than in confronting the seeming absurdity of the beeple price tag the thirdhighest ever for an artwork by a living artist people began to grapple with the power and promise of digital assets themselvesthe blockchainthe idea behind the blockchain arose in  but the virtual currency bitcoin laid out in a white paper in  became its first widely used application although today there are some  other cryptocurrencies bitcoin remains the preeminent onebitcoin’s blockchain is used only to support the cryptocurrency but ethereum’s blockchain with its ability to embed “smart contracts” illustrates how the technology can also support nfts and a wide variety of other uses including secure storage and exchange of medical records enotary and taxesethereum  in the midst of a slow rollout could have enormous environmental benefits instead of requiring the miningintensive and powerdraining “proof of work” that underlies bitcoin ethereum  is expected to utilize “proof of stake” to validate its transactions such networks may be a logical place to find green investment opportunities in the blockchain realmprominent figures in the field suggest that despite the outsized recent auction and investment results seen by nfts and bitcoin blockchain technology is still in its infancy they compare blockchain circa  to the internet circa  when email made the public first appreciate that it could be useful for something then by  the internet had become a crucial part of daily lifeblockchain can still be equally transformative and foster a multiplicity of green investment opportunities the trick is to dive in and find them lowerpower mining methods fueled by wind sun and water are a good place to startthis column does not necessarily
