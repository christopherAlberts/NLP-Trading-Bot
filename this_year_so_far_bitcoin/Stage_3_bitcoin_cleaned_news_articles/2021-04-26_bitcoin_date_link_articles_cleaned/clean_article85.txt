making them more expensive for hackers to attack they have also been around for years so if there was a bug we would likely know about it she addsfor most investors buying a bitcoin which has had a price as high as  per coin likely isn’t an option ethereum costs more than  per coin and even litecoin at over  may be more than you want to spend but coinbase allows users to buy a small fraction of a coin it’s common for investing apps like robinhood to allow traders to buy fractional shares — like investing  in amazon instead of the more than  you would need to buy a full share with coinbase
