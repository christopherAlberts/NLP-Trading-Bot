an ethereum foundation researcher carl beekhuizen in a recent blogpost has said ethereum is working on a major shift which will help save up to  per cent of the energy it currently consumes notably ethereum already uses much lower energy than the most popular cryptocurrency bitcoin ethereum will soon be completing the transition to proofofstake pos from the proofofwork pow system according to beekhuizenbeekhuizen wrote that several teams of engineers are working overtime to ensure that the merge implying the moment ethereum switches from pow to pos happens soon without compromising on safetydigiconomist estimates that ethereum miners currently consume  twh per year which works out to  gigawatt continuingly this means that pos is  more energy efficient based on the conservative estimates which reflects a reduction of at least  in total energy use he addedthe pos method already in use by other smaller cryptocurrencies permits access to new coins based on how many coins a miner already owns if a miner owns  of all coins they can access only  of new coins this system eliminates the need for energyintensive numbercrunching because a miners rate of coin access is a product of their stake not of their workas a result proofofstake mining software can essentially work on one normal computer rather than a warehouse of servers and there is no longer any strategic need to consume an increasing amount of energyalso read bitcoin price recovers to  after elon musks meeting with minersdifference between pow and pos modelsboth bitcoin and etheruem currently use the proofofwork model beyond the energy consumption issue in the case of pow there are also fears that mining pools a joint group of cryptocurrency miners could dominate the mining game in future leading to security risks and centralisation of mining powerin pos miners dont need computational power and they are replaced with validators validators dont compete to create blocks or mine digital coins but are chosen at random by an algorithm if  validators agree on the state of the block it is considered final validators must bet their entire stake if they collude down the line theyll lose the entire stakescaling solutions such as rollups and sharding will help further decrease the energy consumed pertransaction by leveraging economies of scale ethereums powerhungry days are numbered and i hope thats true for the rest of the industry too beekhuizen addsalso read cryptocurrency market crashes is it time to sell bitcoinalso read bitcoin tanks below  heres why
