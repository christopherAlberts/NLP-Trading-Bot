note this article is not investment advice and is for informational purposes only do your own researchwith its fixed supply opensource software and peertopeer  structure bitcoin is the global money of the people by the people for the peoplewhat is bitcointhere are countless responses to this simple question and bitcoin analogies are plentiful from bamboo to mycelium and most relevant for this article gold  for people unfamiliar with bitcoin’s attributes the following infographic by bitcoin og wences casares is usefulnote bitcoin is made up of  million satoshis rather than  million bits graphic credit wences casaresimage sourcebitcoin’s inventor satoshi nakamoto was a polymathbitcoin is a fascinating entity which sits at the intersection of cryptography economics and money opensource software and computer science game theory politics and law and more because of bitcoin’s multifaceted nature it means different things to different people in this article i aim to show that bitcoin solves a critical problem facing many of the world’s citizens unsound money this term is unpacked below and the striking absence of a savings technology that can successfully store value into the future i am far from the first person to draw attention to bitcoin’s supreme savings technology — or “number go up” ngu properties the aim of this article is to put the case to everyday people around the world that bitcoin should not simply be viewed as speculation or a “get rich quick scheme” as the mainstream media often likes to portray it but a rational choice by an increasing number of individuals and institutions to benefit from the best savings technology the world has ever seen in my opinion this is one of the extremely rare instances where something is not “too good to be true” that said as with any decision about where to place your hardearned money it does not come without risk historically bitcoin has had significant price corrections although this cycle has been less volatile than previous ones to begin with i would encourage people to only put in the amount they are willing to lose you can start with as little as one or two us dollars — each bitcoin consists of a hundred million satoshis meaning you can buy a fraction of a bitcoini am a believer that having at least some “skin in the game” will incentivize you to further educate yourself on bitcoin which may in turn enable you to consider saving a larger portion of your wealth in bitcoin but there is no shortcut to increasing your conviction to do so you need to put the time in — fortunately nowadays there’s a wealth of excellent podcasts articles and books if you are curious to learn more  as i mentioned bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme and anything you do choose to save in bitcoin you should be thinking about holding for at least four years or more the reason being if you were unlucky enough to buy the top of either the  or  bull markets within four years of each you would be back in the green and over a longer time frame even more sosoftware is eating the worldbitcoin’s meteoric rise fits in with the broader digital revolution which is dematerializing the physical world the investor marc andreessen famously said “software is eating the world” software’s inexorable march has already swallowed our social networks facebook telephone directories and maps google video shops netflix music players calculators and countless other items smartphones and the list goes onby being hundreds of billions of dollars larger than its nearest competitor combined with its superior monetary properties and decentralized nature it is clear that bitcoin is the winner of the monetary network and asset crown stemming from its significant network effects and size compared to competitors it is not the “myspace of crypto” as some people have sought to characterize it in its  existence bitcoin has already eaten a  trillionsized chunk out of the legacy financial system when you zoom out from the daily price fluctuations and consider bitcoin’s total addressable market is in the many hundreds of trillions of dollars it is only getting started croesusbtc’s graphic below shows bitcoin’s current size relative to its total addressable market other “store of value” instruments and just how early it still is if you’d like a more in depth look at how early it still is see herethe soundest moneyat its core bitcoin is the soundest money ever invented by human civilizationthe term “sound money” is contested and in this article i define sound money as one in which its total supply is not at risk of being devalued by the arbitrary printing of vast quantities of additional monetary units a form of money which is continually devalued through the printing of additional units is known as “unsound” or “easy” money such currency devaluation is a feature not a bug of most if not all fiat currencies around the world fiat in this context meaning a legal tender or currency by government order fiat currencies imply a degree of coercion by the state on its citizens for example citizens are forced to pay taxes in their country’s fiat currency bitcoin on the other hand is a freemarket money which citizens from around the world are free to opt into if they wish tobitcoin is sound money because for the first time in human history building on  years of research development and demand see timeline below satoshi nakamoto invented digital scarcity and gave bitcoin a fixed supply of  million coins unlike fiat currencies after the  million coins have been minted no more can be minted as a result holders of bitcoin know that the amount they hold cannot ever be debased or devalued for example if someone holds  bitcoin or ten million satoshis today they know that their share of bitcoin’s total supply will be  ÷  million or  of the total supply — foreversatoshi also designed bitcoin to be incredibly resilient in a hostile environment to date despite having  trillion on the network bitcoin has not been hacked one way satoshi achieved this with bitcoin by solving the problem of fiat currency’s reliance on a trusted third party to operate by drawing on the technology underpinning other peertopeer networks such as filesharing network bittorrent launched in  satoshi successfully launched the bitcoin protocol on january   using “unstoppable code” bitcoin does not have a headquarters with a physical front door for anyone to knock on to paraphrase michael saylor satoshi started a fire in cyberspace and unlike previous iterations of freemarket monies which relied on trusted third parties bitcoin’s decentralized nature means there is no single physical location for a person or authority to douse out the flamestheoretically bitcoin’s opensource software bitcoin core can be changed but much like the us constitution the threshold to alter it is high and requires consensus among the network of computers running bitcoin’s code known as nodes no single actor however powerful has undue influence over the system and the more people who run their own node the more decentralized and resilient the system becomes to undesirable changes consequently incremental changes to bitcoin core are implemented because the majority of the network deems them to be in the interests of the bitcoin project as a wholefor a more indepth discussion of bitcoin’s sound money properties and why they are arguably superior to its competitors including gold see vijay boyapati’s article “the bullish case for bitcoin” which is a mustread and is accessible in terms of complexitywhy does sound money matterif you need to ask this question it is likely that you are privileged enough not to have lived in a country which has experienced high levels of inflation or at the extreme hyperinflation when a country’s currency becomes essentially worthless countries that have experienced this in living memory are among others weimar germany venezuela lebanon argentina zimbabwe and turkey one way hyperinflation occurs is when central banks print their national currencies to such an extent that the currency becomes worthless unsurprisingly such a process is detrimental to human security and dignity common stories include people trying to spend all of their currency the very opposite of saving immediately because they know that its purchasing power the next day will be significantly reduced citizens forced to use unsound money has too often resulted in their impoverishment and the value of their hardearned savings — often generational wealth — evaporating in front of their eyes with no choice but to suffer the tragic results by way of example on august   in caracas venezuela a roll of toilet paper cost  million bolívars the equivalent of  in zimbabwe in   trillion zimbabwe dollar bills were introduced and at the time when in a bar it was not uncommon for the price of the drinks to double by the time of the second round though as we will see it is not just “developing” world countries who suffer the effects of unsound money citizens in “developed” countries have been left increasingly exposed to its deleterious effectsfor the first time as a result of its fixed supply and opensource nature bitcoin offers citizens a choice to place their hardearned savings in a savings account which algorithmically cannot be devalued through the printing of additional monetary units by taking the money printing press out of human hands bitcoin has liberated savers and their families around the world bringing back hope to people as they now have the means to save and therefore be in control of their own destiniesbitcoin offers people a choicebitcoin offers people who can access the internet the opportunity to choose to save in the sound money of bitcoin a system which has a known and predictable monetary policy and importantly is reliable — it has had  of uptime since going live in  and is accessible  and  days per year unlike traditional banking bitcoin does not have inconvenient opening times as it does not sleep according to the lindy effect popularized by nassim nicholas taleb with every block the bitcoin protocol adds to its blockchain — approximately every  minutes which can be thought of as the heartbeat of the world’s first global opensource monetary network — the longer it is probabilistically likely to exist into the future bitcoin has existed for  years and therefore the lindy effect indicates that we should expect its future lifetime to be at least a further  yearsunsound money with minuscule or zero interest rateson the other hand people around the world can choose to store their wealth in their national currency which is being everincreasingly devalued by the printing of additional units — or in unsound money not only that but saving in bank accounts with interest rates which are commonly close to zero or negative it means savers are not rewarded for saving and at worst are paying their bank to save it is also worth adding that in the world of modern economics fiat currencies only came into existence in  when president nixon passed a law taking the united states off the gold standard — before which dollars were redeemable in gold after  dollars were redeemable with nothing zilch nada ultimately a fiat currency’s value is in large part derived from the government’s ability to maintain trust in said currencyit is not just savers in countries experiencing high levels of inflation or hyperinflation who are turning to bitcoin to store their wealth the same is true in the united states home of the current global reserve currency the economic fallout from the  crisis and more recently the  pandemic has accelerated the devaluing of the usd data from the federal reserve — the central bank of the united states — indicates that the broad measure of the stock of dollars known as the  money supply rose from  trillion at the start of  to  trillion in september  the increase of  trillion equals  of the total supply of dollarsthis means nearly one in five dollars was created in it also means that at a stroke of a computer key every other dollar in existence had an  reduction in purchasing power the chart below illustrates thisneel kashkari president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis is even on record on cbs on march   as saying “there’s no end to our ability to ” each “flooding” inevitably devalues every other dollar in existence reducing the purchasing power of hardearned usd cash savingsif in doubt zoom outbitcoin’s price has experienced high levels of volatility however as it has become increasingly adopted its volatility has reduced it is worth noting that no monetary asset is able to be bootstrapped from zero to becoming a global money without having volatility — to do so would defy the laws of physics it is also worth noting that since inception bitcoin’s volatility trends to the upside consequently the longer people have held a portion of their savings in bitcoin the more it has increased in purchasing powerthe chart below — created by the former dutch institutional investor planb — shows that bitcoin priced in usd has not fallen beneath the  week moving average wma since launching bitcoin’s  wma has consistently moved in an upward direction put another way bitcoin holders who hold over a sequence of at least four years have had their savings accrue in value in us dollar terms hence a simple strategy but tricky to implement at first as people tend to think they can increase profits by trading for accumulating savings in bitcoin is buy an initial position buy the dip when there is a significant price drop — historically – but seemingly less in this cycle and hold on for dear life hodl the hodl meme originates from a post on bitcointalkorg by a drunk user who famously misspelt holdinginstitutional adoption has derisked bitcoinled by the visionary bitcoin advocate and longest serving publicly listed company ceo michael saylor who happens to be an actual rocket scientist numerous publicly listed companies including electric car giant tesla have put bitcoin on their company balance sheets many other types of institutions have also purchased bitcoin including the insurance firm massmutual typically the most risk averse category of institution real estate firms sovereign wealth funds and small and medium enterprises have also been acquiring bitcointhe next part of the article briefly touches on altcoins cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin bitcoin and the environment and central bank digital currencies cbdcs these are big topics in their own right and given the scope of this article i will only touch on them at a high levela brief note on altcoinsyou might be wondering whether the next bitcoin is lying in wait in the  and counting other cryptocurrencies currently listed on coinmarketcap the short answer is monetary history has shown that there is a tendency for the market to converge on the soundest money at the expense of all other monies² no other altcoin can compete with bitcoin’s superior monetary properties established market cap network effects mining and hardware infrastructure atms and so forth if an altcoin is able to do gazillions of transactions per second it is because they have made a tradeoff somewhere else most likely in it not being truly decentralized if you remember the latter is a fundamental feature in order to keep the temptation to print more monetary units out of human hands second such a take fails to appreciate that increased transaction throughput and speed can be achieved on the second layer of bitcoin such as the lightning network this way the decentralization of bitcoin’s base layer is not compromisedaltcoins should be thought of in the same way as startups —  will fail some will strike it rich by selecting the  but most people will lose money if you’re looking for a reliable store of value and savings account i would recommend looking no further than bitcoinhowever if you’re looking for high risk high reward and you’re willing to put research and time in you might be successful in the altcoin space — though you might also lose everything so make sure you go in with your eyes open also remember to compare any profits to bitcoin terms because if you’re not beating bitcoin you might as well stick to bitcoin and save yourself the time and stress and tax bill on trading altcoins willy woo’s article on “degen” and “oscillator” altcoins is well worth a reada brief note on bitcoin and the environmentthere is a lot of talk in the mainstream media about bitcoin being terrible for the environment first it is important to understand that the computational power or hash rate which the bitcoin network expends is proportional to the network’s security currently there is  trillion sitting in the middle of the table and it is bitcoin’s hash rate which secures this if you see value in the world having access to a cheap secure and reliable savings account then the energy is put to good use bitcoin itself inspires and funds green energy research as it incentivizes the usage of otherwise stranded natural resourcessecond in his article on the environmental impact of bitcoin mining christopher bendiksen hits on an important point “bitcoin is as green as an electric car nothing about bitcoin requires emissions it will take whatever electricity you feed it if the world goes green so does bitcoin” since the cost to produce renewable energy is becoming increasingly competitive compared with fossil fuels the probability that bitcoin mining continues to become greener increaseshowever and arguably most importantly of all as a result of its sound money properties bitcoin enables a deflationary meaning a reduction in global prices economic system which would allow us to break out of the current “endless growth” economic model meaning shock and horror bbitcoin is actually good for the environment³ this is such an important and underdiscussed topic that i will be writing about it in a future articlea brief note on central bank digital currenciesthe majority of central banks are working on creating national cbdcs as they offer a route out of sorts from the  postcovid monetary quagmire that they find themselves in across the world central banks have become “the only game in town”⁴ and a consistent policy response has been to print more money otherwise known by the popular meme “money printer go brrr”of all the cbdcs under development china’s digital yuan is at the furthest stage and is already being trialed in certain states with cbdcs central banks will be able to offer digital dollars pounds or yuan directly to citizens some people think this will threaten bitcoin’s rise the short answer is “no” as they will still be a form of unsound money — meaning endless units can be printed — unlike bitcoin’s fixed supply of  million as cbdcs no longer require commercial banks to distribute these digital currency units the writing is on the wall for our high street banks in my opinion this is part of the reason for the banks’ uuturn on bitcoin as recently lots of major and longestablished banks have announced that they will offer bitcoin custody and banking serviceswhat will cbdcs mean for savers well because they will be digital and programmable they will give central banks much more optionality in terms of how they distribute capital into the economic system for example it is theoretically possible for them to set different interest rates for different citizens in the same country — a low or negative interest rate for older wealthier citizens and a higher interest rate for younger less wealthy citizens in china’s digital yuan trial it has come to light that the system enables an expiration date to be set for certain amounts of currency when seeking to “boost” the economy in this way cbdcs would have the capability to actively prevent or discourage saving and impinge on citizens’ rights to choose when and how to spend their money on the other hand bitcoin — because you are your own bank and own all of your satoshis directly when held on a hardware wallet or similar selfcustody solutions — has no expiration date and you are free to do what you want with it when you want tocbdcs would also give central banks the functionality to switch off citizens’ cbdc accounts if they were in breach or considered to be in breach of certain rules and regulations in the wrong hands they hold the capacity to be a oneway road to greater levels of state control and at worst a “”esque dystopia i am not saying all this will happen only that the possibility exists and — as history tends to show — if the ability to do something exists for the purposes of power and control over a long enough time span some humans in leadership positions are likely to choose to use such functionality to further their own interests and agendas if you’re interested to find out more about this topic then simon dixon is a wellinformed sourcebitcoin’s too expensive i’m too late to the partypeople have been saying this since the bitcoin price was    and  per coin and the same will be said when the price is   million and beyondthe following three facts put the “bitcoin’s too expensive i’m too late to the party” statement into context global bitcoin adoption currently stands at around  of the world’s population and bitcoin solves a problem facing billions of people around the world — that of unsound money and the lack of a cheap secure and reliable savings account bitcoin’s market cap is  trillion and its addressable market is in the hundreds of trillions monetary history is full of examples of more technologically sound monies replacing less technologically sound competitors shells ➡ glass beads ➡ silver ➡ gold ➡ it can be argued that bitcoin can already be seen to be eating into gold owing to its superior monetary technology as expressed in the chart belowby exhibiting superior monetary properties compared to other existing monies technology in my opinion bitcoin is on track to becoming the primary store of value for global citizens the latest development in monetary technological development its consistent appreciation in price is merely signaling that an increasing number of individuals and more recently institutions are rationally choosing to store their wealth in the soundest money available to them as a result of bitcoin’s opensource nature this choice is open to you as well tooconclusionas i hope this article has demonstrated bitcoin’s fixed supply of  million coins decentralized nature and unstoppable code make it the soundest money invented by human civilizationcurrently people around the world are working increasingly harder for everdevaluing national currencies bitcoin’s growth at over  per year for the last  years offers global citizens the choice to store their wealth in the latter and not the former by giving people around the world access to a cheap secure and reliable savings account satoshi has returned hope to individuals that the future will be better not only for them but for their family friends and communityin light of what i have outlined above i recommend that everyone tries to place at least a small portion of their savings in bitcoin to get off zero even if it is one dollar’s worth  satoshis at the time of writing if you are or aren’t ready to do that i strongly recommend you take some more time to educate yourself further on what bitcoin is and why it is important see the resources section below it is a fascinating and rewarding topic and there’s always something new to learnreferences¹ bitcoin’s
