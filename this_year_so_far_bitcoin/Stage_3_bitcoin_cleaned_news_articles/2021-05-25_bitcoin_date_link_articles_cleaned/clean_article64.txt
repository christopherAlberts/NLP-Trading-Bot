breaking bitcoin ecdsa vs xmssbitcoin relies on several algorithms to secure the coin from theft prominent among these is the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm ecdsaan ecdsa employs asymmetric encryption to generate publicprivate key pairs what crypto users employ to send and receive coins consequently a classical computer will require at least  billion years’ worth of bruteforce computing time to derive a private key from a public keythe advent of quantum computing however suggests that this encryption safeguard may soon be brokenunlike the public cryptosystem rsa the math behind an elliptic curve algorithm is fairly complexan ecdsa algorithm solves for an elliptic curve structured algebraically over a finite field this requires finding a set of points that satisfy an equation using two variables where one variable generally is an exponent of two and the other is an exponent of three     ax  bsince solving a discrete algorithm is far harder than factoring given similarlength numbers elliptic curve algorithms are generally viewed as more secure than previous cryptography particularly the rsa algorithmwhen quantum computing arrives however the ecdsa will likely be viewed as cryptocurrency’s weak link the algorithm simply cannot withstand a powerful quantum computer intent on deriving a user’s private key from their public key consequently any hacker with access to a quantum computer intent on taking your coins will be able to do sowhos at risk if ecdsa is brokenwhen cryptocurrency users initiate a transaction they broadcast their public key to the entire world until this public key is changed the user’s private key remains theoretically susceptible to being deciphered by a quantum computerremember most bitcoin addresses share the hash of the public key rather than the public key itself it’s only after funds are spent that the actual public key is revealedstory continuesthis is why it’s best practice to only use an address once doing so means that even if a public key can be cracked in the future after a transaction it results in a private key that doesn’t control any funds because it can only be used onceit’s also why many bitcoin wallets take it upon themselves to automatically change a user’s address with each new transactionearly bitcoin adopters in bitcoin’s early days bitcoin users relied solely on a paytopublic key script known as  to conduct transactions eventually new bitcoin users were able to use a hash of the public key for extra protectionas a result anyone who received bitcoin from mining back then remains at risk unless they move their funds to a  wallet that means roughly a quarter of all bitcoins  million btc are potentially vulnerable to a quantum attack source deloittecomthe average investor for added security bitcoin requires each transaction to undergo multiple confirmations after it’s mined and included in a block a fastenough quantum computer could derive a private key from a public key however before it’s mined and confirmed multiple times before it’s included in a blockonce successful an attacker could use the private key to create a new transaction — and send funds to hisher walletthis scenario is not unlike a miner using an advanced quantum computer to take a blockchain’s mining operations by speeding up the mining process an attacker can take majority control  over the total network hash rate known as a  attackthe attacker could then reverse any previous transactions and conduct doublespending at present asic mining chips are fairly fast and potentially serve as a firewall against  attacksrelated consequences once the ecdsa is broken banks and internetrelated companies will need to update their security protocols although these centralized institutions will likely find it a hassle they won’t encounter the same sort of obstacles facing bitcoinall of the cryptocurrency’s nodes would need updating to a new quantumresistant signature schemelikewise all blockchain users would need to move their funds to new quantumresistant addressescrypto users who have lost their addresses will retain funds vulnerable to attack unfortunately no one will be able to distinguish these users from those who simply haven’t migrated their coins to quantumresistant addresses this in turn will likely instigate a contentious legal issue source faqqinfoxmss a new paradigm shiftquantum resistant ledger qrl appears to be quickly gaining notice among the quantumawarethe cryptocurrency recently had its xmss extended merkle signature scheme standardized and approved by the national institute of science and technology nistit’s fairly easy to grasp xmss as its based on another wellknown cryptosecure algorithm known as winternitz ots onetime signature plusxmss does not rely on the user to remember whether they have reused a onetime signature however instead the qrl web wallet reviews past transactions and automatically “uses the number of sent transactions to calculate the current xmss tree index” sourceunlike conventional digital signature schemes xmss requires a constant updating of the private key consequently xmss is known as a stateful hashbased signature schemebeing stateful qrl can track each xmss signature that has been used from the merkle tree seeded by a private key as a result qrl discourages signature reuse  as it substantially diminishes the private key’s security to the point where a classical computer could break the keythis tracking enables xmss users to conduct up to  possible outgoing transactions although that’s quite extensive qrl can also generate iterative ots trees from a single primary tree key their tracking system regenerates a new tree as neededas qrl’s documentation explains this logic goes to the heart of xmssxmss  ethereum the qrl team is currently working on a project called enqlave an ethereum web wallet enqlave secures a user’s ethereum as well as their different tokens     and  against a quantum computer attack in essence it operates as a longterm storage vaultthe technology rests on creating a unique quantumsafe address via a smart contract aside from using a standard ethereum ecdsa signature enqlave relies on qrl’s xmss signature as wellconcluding remarksgiven its foundational success xmss is likely to become the standard for postquantum cryptography indeed the public’s gradual acceptance of quantum computing as an intractable threat is certainly cementing that reputationhow quickly ecdsa will fade from view because of this reality is
