for more information see how we make moneyfor all you’ve probably heard about bitcoin dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies lately many financial experts say it’s the technology behind crypto you should really be paying attention to“the underlying technology that most cryptocurrencies rely on — which is blockchain — is a transformative technology” says lule demmissie president of ally invest “and cryptocurrency just happens to be one of those transformations”some believe blockchain technology has the potential to change nearly every facet of our lives far beyond crypto’s impact on our financial portfolios dr richard smith executive director of the foundation for the study of cycles a nonprofit organization dedicated to studying recurring patterns throughout economies and cultures calls it a “revolution”even crypto skeptics see the value in blockchain technology the real jewel is blockchain says chris chen cfp of insight financial strategists in newton massachusetts he believes blockchain is likely to have a lot more staying power than popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin which he calls a flash in the pan “blockchain will continue to change the way that we do things”that all sounds great but what exactly does it mean here’s what you need to know about blockchain and what a blockchain revolution might look likewhat is blockchainthink of a blockchain as a novel digital form of recordkeepingblockchain is the underlying technology that many cryptocurrencies — like bitcoin and ethereum — operate on but its unique way of securely recording and transferring information has broader applications outside of cryptocurrencya blockchain is a type of distributed ledger distributed ledger technology dlt allows record keeping across multiple computers known as “nodes” any user of the blockchain can be a node but it takes a lot of computer power to operate nodes verify approve and store data within the ledger this is different from traditional recordkeeping methods which store data in a central place such as a computer servera blockchain organizes information added to the ledger into blocks or groups of data each block can only hold a certain amount of information so new blocks are continually added to the ledger forming a chaineach block has its own unique identifier a cryptographic “hash” the hash not only protects the information within the block from anyone without the required code but also protects the block’s place along the chain by identifying the block that came before itthe cryptographic hash is “a set of numbers and letters that can be up to  digits long” says vikas agarwal a partner in pwc’s financial services advisory practice “that’s the unique code that allows the puzzle pieces to fit together”once information is added to the blockchain and encrypted with a hash it’s permanent and unchangeable each node has its own record of the full timeline of data along the blockchain going back to its start if someone tampered with or hacked into one computer and manipulated the data for their own gain it wouldn’t alter the information stored by other nodes the altered record can be easily distinguished and corrected since it doesn’t match the majority“the way that the system works it’s almost impossible for someone to replicate the computing power that happens on the back end to reverse engineer it and somehow figure out what all those hashes are” agarwal sayshow it workshere’s an example of how blockchain is used to verify and record bitcoin transactionsa consumer buys bitcointhe transaction data is sent across bitcoin’s decentralized network of nodesnodes validate the transactionafter approval the transaction is grouped with other transactions to form a block which is added to an evergrowing chain of transactionsthe completed block is encrypted and the transaction record is permanent it cannot be removed or altered on the blockchainbitcoin’s blockchain is public which means anyone who owns bitcoin can view the transaction record while it can be difficult to trace the identity behind an account the record shows which accounts are transacting on the blockchain public blockchains also allow any user with the required computer power to participate in approving and recording transactions onto the blockchain as a nodebut not all blockchains are public blockchains can be designed as private ledgers so an owner is able to limit who can make changes or additions to the blockchain while the pool of participants may be smaller on a private blockchain it’s still decentralized among those who participate private blockchains maintain the security of any data stored within the database using the same encryption methodsthe idea of a secure decentralized permanent record of information has drawn interest across a number of industries and potentially holds solutions for many security concerns recordkeeping processes and data ownership issues we face todaya blockchainbased futureblockchain gives us the technology to move information securely agarwal says and have nearly complete certainty in knowing the authenticity of any piece of information you want to protectconsider for example stories that have circulated in recent weeks of meme subjects and celebrities who cashed in on digital property by selling nfts nonfungible tokensbecause the underlying blockchain record is immutable nfts allow sellers to verify a digital asset’s authenticity when you buy an nft that transaction is added to the blockchain ledger and becomes a verifiable record of ownership for those who want the ability to verify a digital work’s authenticity blockchain helps value digital art and collectibles similarly to their physical counterparts in theory this leads to creators maintaining value through things earning royalties on copies made of digital art“that might seem confusing to the rest of us who don’t value those things” smith says “but what it’s really demonstrating is that you can have a digital economy with digital property rights” it gives you the ability to uniquely say ‘i own and control this piece of the digital economy’ he saysfor many of us one of the most impactful usecases of blockchain technology may be protecting and securely transferring personal dataimagine if your banking information was stored on a blockchain when you open an account with a new financial institution or transfer information between institutions a blockchain ledger could help quickly and securely ensure the transfer or new account is accurate and legitimate using your alreadystored information “that has the ability to reduce a lot of costs a lot of overhead and also become a good way to reduce fraud” agarwal sayshe predicts blockchain technology has potential across nearly every industry “because every industry has some type of information that they’re trying to exchange in a very secure way” an election run on blockchain technology could benefit from a voting record that gets locked in and cannot be altered after the fact businesses could maintain more accurate inventory records using blockchain blockchain could even help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions with better transparency around product supply chains the technology may help food suppliers more efficiently trace recalled products or allow consumers to avoid goods created using exploited labor practicesuses like this illustrate blockchain’s appeal not only for security but also what chen calls the integrity of information “blockchain has the potential to give people more security and assurance around that” agarwal saysinvesting in the futurebusinesses and governments around the world are continuing to test and implement blockchain technology but none of this will happen overnight if we ever reach a point where government currency is blockchainbased or medical records are converted to a blockchain it won’t be anytime soonin the meantime you can bet on the power of blockchain by adding a blockchainbased cryptocurrency like bitcoin to your portfolio though that’s not the only way to put your dollars behind the technologyyou can also adjust more traditional investments so they’re blockchainforward for example look into whether your etfs or mutual funds include companies that are developing blockchain technologies or beginning to use blockchain in their business operationsthere are even etfs wholly made up of these types of companies known as blockchain etfs one example launched in  is the siren nasdaq blockchain economy index blcn which has outpaced the sp ’s overall return both yearoveryear and on a threeyear average these funds don’t put any of your money in crypto specifically instead they invest in select company stocks — ranging from longestablished businesses like ibm to lesserknown startups like galaxy digitalwhile it still doesn’t guarantee a return this can be a more conservative alternative to putting your money into the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency market directlychen compares the difference between speculating in cryptocurrencies directly and investing in blockchain companies to the california gold rush of two centuries ago “lots of people rushed in there to dig for gold and most of them never made any money” he says “the folks who made the money are those who sold the shovels the companies that are supporting the development of blockchain are the shovel sellers”
