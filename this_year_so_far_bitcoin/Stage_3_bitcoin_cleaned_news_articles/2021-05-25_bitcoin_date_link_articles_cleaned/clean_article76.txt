more than a decade after satoshi nakamoto combined proof of work and bitcoin mining together fallacious comparisons of “energy cost per transaction” continue to be spread by seemingly intelligent and wellresearched individualswe can trace much of the spread of this narrative back to alex de vries—a data scientist who goes by the handle “digiconomist” and is cited in nearly every antibitcoin energy article and oped in the mainstream media theres just one problem neither he nor most of the journalists that cite him regularly disclose that his employer is de nederlandsche bank dnb the dutch central bank which is an undeniable opponent of bitcoin and open payment rails it’s irresponsible for journalists to cite de vries or his work without disclosing his conflict of interest he is effectively a dnb lobbyistde vries’s work for the dnb focuses on financial economic crime in  the dnb required controversial and overly aggressive kyc regulations for digital asset firms serving the netherlands among other things the regulation required users prove they control their withdrawal address the rule was reversed last week in court after bitonic formally complained the dnb is also leading cbdc development and integration in europede vries website digiconomist described as a “hobby project” apparently misleads readers by failing to disclose his employment the site uses unreasonable assumptions and deceptive infographics about socalled single bitcoin transaction footprintsthis has led others to come up with similarly misleading transactionbased comparisons to erroneously claim which altcoins use the least amount of electricity as a function of utilityin march bill gates repeated this fud which was then echoed by the media using de vries’s own misleading data more recently elon musk became the latest to spread misinformation when he tweeted that tesla would no longer accept bitcoin as payment for vehicleswe are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions especially coal which has the worst emissions of any fuelwe are also looking at other cryptocurrencies that use  of bitcoins energytransactionsource twitterafter crashing the market which coincided with some suspicious trading activity he followed upenergy usage trend over past few months is insane httpscbeciorgsource twitteralthough we can’t know what musk was actually thinking if musk had bothered to read the cambridge bitcoin electricity consumption index cbecis faq then he would have learned that “energy cost per transaction” is a misconceptionthe popular “energy cost per transaction” metric is regularly featured in the media and other academic studies despite having multiple issuesfirst transaction throughput ie the number of transactions that the system can process is independent of the network’s electricity consumption adding more mining equipment and thus increasing electricity consumption will have no impact on the number of processed transactionssecond a single bitcoin transaction can contain hidden semantics that may not be immediately visible nor intelligible to observers for instance one transaction can include hundreds of payments to individual addresses settle secondlayer network payments eg opening and closing channels in the lightning network or potentially represent billions of timestamped data points using open protocols such as opentimestampssource cbeci  faqthe cbeci even goes a step further dispelling common mainstream climate narrativesthere is currently little evidence suggesting that bitcoin directly contributes to climate change even when assuming that bitcoin mining was exclusively powered by coal  a very unrealistic scenario given that a nontrivial number of facilities run exclusively on renewables  total carbon dioxide emissions would not exceed  million tons of  which would roughly correspond to  of the world’s total emissionsthis is not to say that environmental concerns regarding bitcoin’s electricity consumption should be disregarded there are valid concerns that bitcoin’s growing electricity consumption may pose a threat to achieving the united nations sustainable development goals in the futurehowever current figures should be put into perspective available data shows that even in the worst case ie mining exclusively powered by coal bitcoin’s environmental footprint currently remains marginal at bestsource cbeci  faqadam back creator of proof of work made an effort to set the record straightdoge is years unmaintained a literal joke copy of outdated version of bitcoin with long known vulnerabilities factually bitcoin doesnt consume incremental power per transaction and has  like lightning and liquidbtc which amplify capabilitiessource twitterit makes no difference how many transactions take place on a proofofwork blockchain a single bitcoin transaction could in theory provide final settlement for a layer  channel that contained millions of transactionsadditionally the energy spent on mining each block isnt just producing a transaction its securing every transaction that ever came before it that energy is securing all of the transactions that have ever happened in the history of bitcoin — including elon musks own personal transactions as well as the preceding transactions that led to those transactionsmichael saylor also attempted to help clarify musk’s misconceptionsthe estimated electricity consumption per httpcbeciorg ytd increased  during the same period that the network grew  in assets meaning that energy efficiency dramatically improved during this time period bitcoin is becoming less energy intensive as it scalessource twittermusk replied by tweeting out three urls the first link was about the greenidge power plant in upstate new york that came back online to mine bitcoin with natural gas nic carter later did the research that musk and mainstream journalists should have done in the first placemsm narrative old coal power plants are coming back online to mine btcreality  greenidge plant is natgas not coal powered much lower carbon intensity  the plant is buying full carbon offsets  greenidge is mostly feeding the grid powering  of local homesthis is a cornerstone of the new hostile coverage around bitcoin and you may see this talking point about “decommissioned coal plants coming back online to mine btc” hundreds of times only one problem it’s completely falsethis is basically a “saddam has yellowcake” tier misrepresentation simply egregiously wrongsource twitterthe second link was a onesided interview with de vries and the third link heavily featured de vries as well again neither of these links disclosed the fact that de vries is employed by a central bank that opposes bitcoinmusk soon pivoted his misinformed take to announce that he is supposedly working with doge devs on perhaps adopting it as a green payment alternative — a dubious claim given the project has been largely abandoned his comments only served to perpetuate the energy per transaction mythits not just musk and de vries that are perpetuating energy per transaction deception as doge supporters have been touting similarly misleading research from trg datacenters which claims that litecoin uses  kwh per transaction and dogecoin uses  kwh per transactionenergy consumption has nothing to do with how many transactions are mined in a block energy consumption is related to coin issuance and miner profitability not number of transactions nic carter explainedtoday bitcoin miners earn around  millionday which annualizes to around  billion in miner revenue fully  of that revenue derives not from pertransaction fees but from the issuance of new bitcoins this issuance process is finite in fact it’s  done the rate of new coin issuance halves every four years as it approaches that  million limit these are the “halvings” you have probably heard about bitcoiners really love themso the issuance component of miner revenue is structurally decaying over time unless you believe that the price of bitcoin is going to literally double in real terms every four years until  that expenditure and hence energy usage is going to declinesource nic carter  coindeskenergy required to solve complex random guesses cant be faked which makes proof of work an extremely fair neutral and impenetrable physicsbased approach to issue new coins and secure networksif you understand that energy expenditures are a function of miner profitability and not the number of transactions you can begin to understand that doges claim of lowenergy footprint per transaction is entirely misleadingari paul explained in a qaari paul electricity isn’t used for transaction processing it’s used to secure the network doge is pow meaning it faces the same basic dynamics as bitcoin it uses less electricity now because it’s less secureq because of doges unlimited supply it price has some ceiling due to which theres also ceiling for miner profitability beyond which miners wont add more hash rate to network which would keep the electricity consumption below a fixed maximum rate is this incorrectari paul i think that’s accurate  basically anything that depresses a pow’s token price will also depress its security and electricity usage at least generallyq just for clarification depressing pow token price reduces security because of inherent miner reward reduction ie less miners  less network scale less electricity usage  less security appreciate the insightari paul basically yes difficulty of the network adjusts with hashpower miners are rewarded in tokens and will keep investing in hashpower causing higher difficulty as long as it’s profitable higher token value supports more investment in hashpowersource twitterso if profitability and higher token value drives onchain energy consumption one can clearly see that doge would suffer the same increased energy consumption if it were to ever become the success musk suggests it could beironically doge does not solve the problems that musk is concerned about digital currency minerinvestor de flandres  further explained the misconceptions of doge mining in a series of tweetson musk claiming he set up “some little doge mining rigs”there is no such thing as a dogecoin mining machine it is called a scrypt miner which mines predominantly litecoin since dogecoin in mergemined with litecoinsource twitteron the trg datacenter research claiming doge has a low energy per transaction footprintit is all about numbers isnt it on average an antminer or equivalence consumes  to  kwh of juice processing blocks the numbers above are bogus you also have to understand that confirmations continue indefinitely if today miners each mine  block of ltc and  block of doge then both will consume equal amounts of power if the same miners mine  blocks of ltc and  blocks of doge then doge used less power the problem is that a doge block is mined every minute while an ltc block is mined every  minutes so in effect miners have to mine  more doge blocks than ltc making doge more miner dependent in other words doge is less miner efficient so as doge interestactivity increases there are less empty blocks processed by scrypt miners if this conversation was taking place a year ago an argument could be made that doge uses less energy because there were more empty blocks  of blocks is always  every minute for dogesource twitterdogecoin is pow only because litecoinscrypt is pow and that mining machine assuming  or  is still using  kwh of juice whether it is under heavy or light load mining ltc and doge together so the claim doge uses less is fundamentally a liesource twitterone dogecoin block is created every minute there is  ltc block created every  minutes both  scrypt coins both are mined on the same machines the more popular doge becomes the higher the price the higher the difficulty the more intense the mining the more energy usedsource twitteron musk claiming to work with doge devs to improve its aging protocoldogecoin is a mergemined coin with litecoin the same scrypt miners who own all of the hardware so who is he working with again change the protocol and it ceases to be mined by litecoin miners they would have to hardfork the coin have fun with thatsource twitter“litecoin doesnt ‘help’ secure dogecoins blockchain it basically ‘owns’ dogecoins blockchain because until recently no miners would ever mine just doge it was a losing proposition now it may be more profitable but it still is a byproduct of litecoin mining”source twitterpiss off the litecoinscrypt miners and doge takes a permanent divesource twitter“good luck trying to mine on their own you have to have the miners which have not been manufactured now for nearly  years those which are available are used on ebay and expensive with breakeven around  years”source twitterfurthermore galaxy digital published research highlighting the poor quality of the doge network so why would musk get behind an unmaintained altcoinq why not just make a crypto from scratch that does everything you want technically and has a lot of dev support and doesn’t have high concentration of ownership at least initially elon musk only if doge can’t do it big pain in the neck to create another onesource twitterit’s likely that musk is referring to the challenges that facebook faced when it tried to launch libra mark zuckerburg was famously hauled before congress and stonewalled with regulationit would be less of a headache to use bitcoin or any other modern project turning doge into a high speed centralized payment coin would trigger a hard fork from litecoin which would leave doge on its own with few scrypt miners musk could then create his own scrypt miners and put them in all of his products but that would just turn it into a centralized private payment network one can only assume that he would rather meme his own coin into existence as opposed to dealing with regulators and red tape of course he could just implement bitcoin payments and layer  technologies like everyone elseit remains to be seen if musk is intentionally spreading misinformation or if he is suffering from the dunningkruger effect recent tweets from musk suggest the latter as he seems to lack the fundamental understanding of how decentralized systems work or why they are necessary regardless it’s difficult to tell what musk’s true motives arewhen the false energy per transaction narratives that are spread by central bank economist de vries musk and doge supporters can be easily debunked by reading the cbecis own faq its not difficult to see it’s a hustleintelligent investment teams are able to look past these false narratives the sustainable thematic equities team at alliancebernstein published an informative post on bitcoin from an esg perspectivewe believe concerns about the highenergy intensity of bitcoin mining are overstated and the technology can play a lessacknowledged but important role in promoting financial inclusion source alliancebernstein  is bitcoin esg friendly for equity investorsark invest also reiterated firm support for bitcoinin our view the concerns around bitcoin’s energy consumption are misguided contrary to consensus thinking we believe the impact of bitcoin mining could become a net positive to the environment with realworld data we demonstrate how mining could impact the amount of renewable energy provisioned to the grid by transforming intermittent power resources into baseload generation by way of energy storage we illustrate that renewables would be able to satisfy only  of the grid’s needs in the absence of bitcoin mining but  with the commercial “subsidies” associated with bitcoin miningsource ark investthe energy spent on bitcoin is the unassailable physical budget for securing the entire financial network other proofofwork projects claiming lower energy budgets are only touting lower levels of security and much lower levels of use while trying to pull a fast one on nonseasoned investorsmusk and altcoin supporters appear to be unaware that it would be virtually impossible to reproduce the neutral and fair launch of bitcoin as well as its astounding network effects around the world and secure track record over the past decade if it were even possible to reproduce bitcoins launch any attempted altcoin would be a decade behind in finding vulnerabilities a decade behind in network effects a decade behind in its proven track record and a decade behind in proving its immutability as sound money it would lack the credibility necessary to become a secure and global reserve assetproof of stake and other newly developed protocols are still unproven experiments that will require years of testing and scrutiny which tend to lack distribution and launch fairness these experiments are not the kinds of protocols the entire world wants backing up the next global reserve asset no one in their right mind chooses to have ones life savings or a company’s treasury guarded by a low security budget based on trust institutions and individuals want the maximum security budget with a nearzero chance of failure for their valuable and hardearned life savingsbitcoin provides security that no other asset can by bridging the physical and virtual world with proof of work it is the most secure energy budget on the face of the planet backed by physics and worth every joule that flows into itthis is a guest post by  opinions expressed are entirely
