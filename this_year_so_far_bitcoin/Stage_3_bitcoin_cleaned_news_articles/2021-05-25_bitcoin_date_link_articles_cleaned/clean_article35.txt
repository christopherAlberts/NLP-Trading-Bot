one of the major forces in the metaverse was created in  in answer to all past financial crises spurred on by what happened in bitcoin has had numerous corrections of as great as  per cent since  each time its bubble burst it was pronounced dead by mainstream media  recorded each “death” which has run into the hundreds over the yearsthe most recent correction has created the same broken record of mainstream media being used to spread fud as whales can then go in and scoop up bitcoin at lower prices‘v’ or ‘u’shaped recoverydebate on whether bitcoin reached a major low has been quelled black swans notwithstanding based on numerous metrics having hit major lows as they did in march   and  however debate rages on about how bitcoin will recover a vshaped recovery would be similar to the post march  recovery a ushaped recovery would suggest more headwinds at hand let’s examine the metricsstablecoins v bitcoinbullish  billion worth of stablecoin usdc hit exchanges this provides buying power for buying back bitcoin stablecoin usdt also continues to climb stablecoin flows are the most bullish since march stablecoin capitalisation particularly usdt actually increased during the correction suggesting that overall investors were using the pullback to buy bitcoinwhale balances are also now at the same levels last seen before the crash when btc was at  they are using their stablecoins to buy back their sold bitcoinsbearish the amount of btc hitting exchanges still is at high levels which suggests more btc selling pressure ahead whales are trying to make up their mind given the tugowar between stablecoins used to buy back btc and btc being added to exchanges of course btc could be used for other purposes such as buying eth or in the case of futures such as on binance or the options market using it for those purposes in which case it is not a bearish event indeed current exchange flows show btc and eth moving off exchanges while usdt is moving onto exchangesfunding ratesbullish funding rates are mostly negative which suggests a bottom in cryptos when shorts have to pay funding fees to longs that suggests an overly crowded space for those who hold short positions whales dont just shoot down fomo in the form of too many long positions but do the same for fud in the form of crowded short positions this could create a short squeezewhale mapswhalemap charts show resistance at  and  but big support at  so it is possible bitcoin bounces around in this zone before breaking to the upside the length of time it does this is predicated on the other metrics discussed heregrayscale gbtcthe grayscale gbtc discount has risen from a peak low of  per cent to a smaller discount of  per cent gbtc has sustained a discount to spot btc prices for three months positive price momentum started on may  early in the current correction there is also a large unlocking ahead keep in mind that gbtc correlates with btc so odds favour gbtc having made a major low but could backandfill for a time before definitively moving higher the current pricevolume action in gbtc as discussed in the focus list report over the weekend should be heedednew usersas the number of users of bitcoin continues to double every year during this two week dip down to  the new user growth on the network accelerated suggesting users are taking this opportunity to enter for the first timethe number of new wallets with less than one btc soared during the correction while there are whales with more than  btc these are labelled as shrimpsbitcoin optionsbitcoin options expire this friday – may  – at  am uct the maximum pain point is at  this means the largest number of bulls calls and bears puts lose at this price level in the past two monthly options expirations bitcoin’s price magnetically moved close to prior pain point price levels by the date of expirationmiscellaneousray dalio now has joined the fray of hnwis who own bitcoinv  umany of the metrics look very similar in structure to the covid white swan recovery in march  when we had a vshaped recovery nvt network value to transactions ratio puts btc at  while  stocktoflow puts it at  if bitcoin is to continue its multiyear pattern with respect to these metrics while odds given the above favour a vrecovery odds are odds this means the odds maybe around  per cent for a vrecovery which still means  per cent for a urecovery all it takes is some additional fud or actual negative news to push bitcoin down at least for a short whilecertainly over the last several years mainstream press has been used to spread fud to drive prices lower at critical levels it doesn’t take much for an institution to pay off some writer to publish something negative on a major platform then go in and buy bitcoin on the reaction sell offmarket
