v wheres the money gerrywhile qcxint dug up a lot of information on cotten and patryns history prior to forming quadriga a motherlode of information about what actually went down at the crypto exchange came through more official channelsafter quadrigas spectacular collapse in january  the supreme court of nova scotia appointed ernst and young to look for the missing quarter of a billion dollars owed to creditors with the most shocking report released in june  the ontario securities commission osc also did their own investigation and released the results of their review in june what was clear in both of their findings was that quadrigas asset shortfall was a result of cottens fraudulent activity what happened at quadriga was an oldfashioned fraud wrapped in modern technology the osc report saidcotten created fictitious accounts and was trading at times in fake dollars and fake bitcoin his largest account was under the alias chris markay and at one point he credited himself with single deposits of  million and  million dollars respectively he had other fake accounts too aretwo deetwo seethree peaohhh — and sceptre gerrythe osc report also found that in the first year of operation cotten was involved in the majority of trades on quadriga unbeknownst to customers he was the counterparty in more than  per cent of the bitcoin trades done on his own companys platform in “he couldn’t control himself  and blew just an absolutely eyepopping amount of money”the investigations also uncovered that cotten mixed customer funds with his own the ontario securities regulator found that between  and  cotten transferred millions of dollars of his clients funds to his and robertsons personal accounts to buy multiple properties and fund their living and travel

time of his death and he is most certainly dead candace berry photographyfacebookqcxint couldnt get that kind of access to cottens activities but he wasnt surprised by the oscs findings to qcxint it followed a pattern of impulsive behaviourhe couldnt control himself by the looks of things and blew just an absolutely eyepopping amount of money he saidthe osc reported that cotten used his customer funds for speculative trades on other cryptocurrency exchanges and when the price of bitcoin was crashing hed try to make up for losses by essentially gambling customer funds digging himself into a holehe was an inveterate gambler … an abysmal trader who lost tens of millions on some of these speculative trades qcxint saidso in the end when customers wanted to withdraw funds cotten became dependent on new money coming into the exchange and the gap between the real and the fake money just got biggerquadriga was a house of cards and then it was a ponzi scheme said journalist amy castor i mean where were the regulatorsquadriga had been registered with the british columbia securities commission which issued a cease trade order in  when it failed to file financial statementsit was also registered in its early years with fintrac canadas money laundering watchdog as a money service business the agency would not comment on what it did — if anything — to ensure quadriga followed regulations a spokesperson for fintrac wrote to cbc that the agency was prohibited by law to disclose that information to the publicpatryn says he had no idea what cotten was up to insisting he parted ways with the company in january  over a disagreement with cotten about listing quadriga on the canadian securities exchange the company never did go public and although patryn remained a beneficial shareholder — holding more than  per cent of the companys shares according to an affidavit he filed in court — it would appear that cotten controlled the company from  until its collapsein a statement released in october  in response to the revelations of fraud in the ernst and young reports jennifer robertson said she was unaware of cottens improper actions that she was not aware of nor did she participate in gerrys trading activities nor his appropriation of customer fundsshe added that she was upset and disappointed to learn about what cotten had been up toin a voluntary settlement agreement made in the fall of  as part of the companys bankruptcy robertson offered to return  million worth of assets to quadriga creditors assets she says she believed were purchased legitimately with cottens earned profits salary and dividendsof the roughly  creditors who had money tied up on the exchange in the end only  made claims about  million was recovered and each creditor is expected to get about  per cent back although the process is still ongoingthe rcmp would not comment on the creditors call to exhume the body nor would police comment on the ongoing investigation the fbi is also mum and wont comment until the case is closer to completionthis image of cash stacked on cotten’s kitchen counter at his home in kelowna bc was part of the evidence collected by the ontario

collected by the ontario securities commission in its investigation of quadrigacx ontario securities commissioncreditors who have contacted the rcmp are frustrated by what appears to be a lack of action on the part of the law enforcement agencyits theft said qcxint you know its like a  bank job could happen and youve got a law enforcement agency that does next to nothing about investigating itqcxint was in contact with a fraud investigator in the rcmps financial crime unit in the toronto area providing him with results of his data investigation and information gathered through sources along the wayeven when there is hard evidence of fraud provided to them you know they would continually come back and say to us we need more evidence even in order to investigate he said i felt like i actually had to present them with a bloody corpse and a gun with fingerprints on it in order just to get them to investigateim not convinced hes deadamy castor the journalist said that cotten had been running ponzi  from the time he was a kid based on what has emerged since his disappearance he was operating a massive ponzi scheme and it was going down in a big way he knew hed have to face the piper so he had to either face maybe going to jail for fraud or find another way out of therewithout official confirmation from rcmp that the body buried in halifax is that of gerald cotten suspicions persist about whether he could still be out thereim not convinced hes dead castor said i wouldnt be surprised if one day you know we saw a press release come out from the us department of justice that said he was arrested somewhere i wouldnt be surprised if other people were implicated in his exit schemeqcxint believes the balance of probabilities points to cotten being dead but said hed be happy to be shown otherwisein the meantime he continues to keep an eye on the blockchain he said funds are still moving in accounts connected to quadriga and that the activity is unusual he wouldnt elaborate further for fear of compromising active investigationswe are not treating this as closed there are still individuals out there who we believe have benefited from the fraud of quadriga now weve got some suspicions about who that might be and that means that they dont want me to be doing what im doingwith files from eunice kim yvette brend and rignam wangkhang
