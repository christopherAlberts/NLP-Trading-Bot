on monday elon musk sent out a tweet stating he spoke with bitcoin miners giving investors confidence to invest in the cryptocurrency again which caused a surge in price myles udland brian sozzi and julie hyman break down what this move may mean for the volatile cryptocurrency marketvideo transcriptjulie hyman once again maybe elon musk driving some stuff here it looks like he tweeted once again this time hes talking once again about his new sort of favorite theme about the climate and environmental implications of cryptocurrencies he said he has been speaking to north american bitcoin miners they committed to publish current and plan renewable usage and ask miners worldwide to do so potentially promisingso there is this theme developing and there were already groups right that were sort of addressing this issue at the moment though myles as i mentioned not seeing a lot of action in cryptocurrencies were going to talk much later much more later about this with the author of that note that i referenced but you know there is at least momentarily a little bit of a pause in the hottest of the actionmyles udland yeah and of course then michael saylor of microstrategy theyve had a lot of crypto to their balance sheet adding to musks tweet saying that the meeting did in fact happen and basically miners in north america are going to coordinate i guess you could think of it to go back to like old school commodities like an opectype group where they can work together to change the mining process such that it is greenerbut i think look the point of the crypto cycle right now and all crypto cycles are driven by price is in i mean i dont know if its a precarious position i mean personally to me it doesnt matter that much if the price of cryptocurrency goes up or down but we have seen the rally itself and the price action within a number of major cryptocurrencies just look a lot less healthy over the last couple of weeks yesterday we saw bitcoin for instance up double digit percentagesstory continuesand sozzi we always talk about volatility and i think it often gets read through too simply as volatility means the price of things are going down but volatility is just large chunks in price large changes in price at a fast rate which can just create for very choppy and again unhealthy conditions within the price of an asset and i think were seeing that in crypto over the last couple of weeks in both directions and i dont think anybody even with  and some change here i dont think anybodys particularly encouraged by whats been happening you know from a price standpoint what the chart looks like now for bitcoin among othersbrian sozzi no its a really good point myles on volatility a couple of things though on my crypto list for this morning ray dalio in a coinbase interview coming out and saying that he owns some bitcoin if you are a long time bitcoin bill bull youre probably hanging on those comments from bridgewater bridgewaters dalio as a validation on your thesisnext up coinbase another big rating call out of jp morgan this morning here abrading the stock and   price target keep in mind goldman sachs out yesterday initiating coverage with its own by rating i believe it was a  price target so youre seeing the sell side come out here on this crypto i would say a crashits not its not a correction i mean bitcoin was about  and change a couple of weeks ago trying to voice support for a company like a coinbase that is very much reliant on the direction of crypto prices and then overall you know myles i do find this interesting i know you follow the crypto space very closelyive started to get into a lot of the crypto blogs and read them more and more the bullishness amongst the tried and true the long time hardcore crypto bulls that doesnt seem to have changed much during this big pullback its interestingmyles udland yeah i dont think thats going to and we can leave that i think theres reasons behind that that we can touch on another time but i think its interesting sozzi we talk about ray dalios positive commentary on bitcoin im reminded last week of mike novogratz was so excited that morgan stanley was going to have its wealth managers now out able to evangelize for bitcoin i think the word that novo used was proselytize on behalf of cryptocurrencieswe have banks out issuing positive research notes on coinbase its funny that the crypto space now feels validated by wall street who is its main enemy now coming in to say we like coins i just find it a little bit interesting is all well say on that that the folks against whom you have positioned yourself are now the saviors of the narrative as some other parts of it have gotten a little bit softerjulie hyman well at the same time theres still a lot of i think criticism that gets leveled at wall street from that group so well see how that dynamic ends up playing out as time goes on
