the new bitcoin mining council announced monday by microstrategy ceo michael saylor and tesla ceo elon musk won’t work “if they tried to do some sort of opeclike thing” because “anyone can come in and mine bitcoin” according to sam bankmanfried ceo of the ftx cryptocurrency exchangethat said the effort opens “this interesting can of worms” bankmanfried said in an interview during an episode of coindesk tv’s first mover show held as part of coindesk’s consensus “if you have a completely open network and the big open players on this open network openly and without any coercion decide to collaborate with each other is that decentralization it’s a little bit of a definitional issue” bankmanfried saidas long as the network remains open however many concerns should be assuaged he said “if they’re like ‘oh we’re just all going to like lower hashrates’ then  just start mining you know if it’s economically efficient”esg escalationbitcoin’s recent price crash to below  was partly triggered by a tweet earlier this month from musk saying tesla would stop accepting bitcoin as payment for electric vehicles due to concerns over the environmental impact of cryptocurrency miningaccording to saylor executives from argo blockchain galaxy digital blockcap hive blockchain and a few other mining companies based in north america joined a meeting over the issue on may  he tweeted that the “leading bitcoin miners in north america have agreed to form the bitcoin mining council to promote energy usage transparency and accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide”subscribe to  by signing up you will receive emails about coindesk products and you agree to our terms  conditions and privacy policythe looming question is whether big institutional investors who otherwise might be tempted to buy bitcoin might be deterred by environmental social and governance concerns known as esg – now a key consideration for many asset managers calls for “greening” bitcoin mining have ramped up in recent weeksthe announcement monday induced a flurry of debate as to whether such a “cabal” ran counter to bitcoin’s underlying principles of decentralization as coindesk reported monday night one of the founding members said the council has no intention to change “the nature of bitcoin” still the closeddoor proceedings rubbed many the wrong way“it’s a healthy occurrence in some ways because i think there was a lot of stupid dialogue going on about esg and stupid not in the sense that esg was stupid but that the dialogue was” bankmanfried said tuesday addingthe dialogue was centered around namecalling and centered around one side saying bitcoin was trashing the planet and the other side saying lol these fking noobs complaining about bitcoin theyre going to get rekt roughly speakingneither response was healthy bankmanfried said “let’s do the math let’s figure out if this is a significant concern and if so let’s figure out how we can address it” he suggestedcarbon offsetsthe ftx founder said the ethereum blockchain’s move away from bitcoin’s proofofwork consensus algorithm to a less energyintensive system known as proofofstake might address some of the climate concerns bankmanfried is heavily invested in the proofofstake solana blockchain among other projects“most of the major cryptocurrencies outside of bitcoin will be substantially less energyintensive and so i think that’s one piece of it but i think that even within proofofwork it’s not prohibitively expensive to buy carbon offsets and that’s something we’ve been looking into and pledged to start doing to offset the energy usage that ftx has” he said
