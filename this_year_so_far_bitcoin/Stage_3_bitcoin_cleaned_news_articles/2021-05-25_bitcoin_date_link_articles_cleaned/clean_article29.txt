bitcoin’s wild gyrations in  have made sure of one thing the future of money will be electronic but it won’t remotely resemble a cyberpunk utopia people’s power will bow to sovereigns’ mightthe mania and panic that have gripped decentralized cryptocurrencies are heightening the attraction of their coming rivals digital cash issued by central banks these tokens will be staid centralized and statecontrolled that’s exactly what users will want in an internet of things world where machines need to settle claims with one another all the time instantaneously but without contributing to global warmingofficial electronic coins will be a new type of central bank liability alongside physical cash though for investors betting on the future value of the dollar yen or the euro they won’t be a novel asset classthat has clear advantages to avoid becoming a lightning rod for fresh speculation means that a global economy powered by fedcoin digital euro and china’s ecny will make far less onerous demands on energy resources than cryptocurrencies in the absence of a trusted intermediary the “mining” or proofofwork protocol that keeps the blockchain secure from doublespending attacks requires powerguzzling hardware between bitcoin and ethereum  the electricity consumed can light up  million american householdsnot so for the distributed ledgers that will verify transfers of official coins these ledgers will only be held by a select group of intermediaries with the central bank’s permission instead of being in a race to solve puzzles faster than malicious actors as we see with decentralized cryptocurrencies the nodes in the network can lock their own funds to back legitimate transactionsthis approach known as proofofstake will require a fraction of the energy proofofwork needs ethereum intends to switch the cryptocurrency ether will replace hardware and electricity as the investment needed to secure the network validators will earn fees by locking up at least  ether that’s a  commitment as i write if they misbehave go offline or fail to do their job the processors can lose their collaterala central authority can perhaps run such a network better after all those who are vouchsafing transactions must have skin in the game as they claim — and somebody trustworthy must ensure that they do as chi lo an economist at bnp paribas asset management asia says “a holder’s identity is inevitably required for verification” of balances on a digital ledger “who has the legal identity of coin holders the government”central banks that aren’t constrained by how much fiat money they can create out of thin air use that flexibility to avoid catastrophe as they did recently during the  pandemic by contrast a “bitcoinized” economy can be dangerous because of finite money supply as lo says if you fix nominal variables real output has to adjust violently to absorb any economic shocksbesides perfect anonymity of cryptocurrencies is impractical it comes with unacceptably high risks of money laundering and terror financing governments do not want to pry into all — or even most — online transactions but they won’t give up their right to lift the veil of pseudonyms when they want hence the interest worldwide in digital cash china’s plans are most advanced but other central banks are also in the frayif cryptocurrency adoption is a headache for governments an overwhelming popularity of digital cash could also be an issue banks could lose deposits should customers prefer having a direct claim on their monetary authorities lenders financing longterm loans with shortterm market liquidity might get into trouble later these risks aren’t new but by ignoring them to a point where subprime mortgagelinked banking losses had to be socialized authorities created a trust gap with the public technoanarchists burst through it with the template for an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trustmore than a decade later the cyberpunk movement’s success is to be measured not by the highly volatile speculative asset class it has helped spawn and popularize but by the rising influence of blockchain technology within the traditional financial system digital cash with inbuilt selfexecuting software code will alter the future of money in a way that cryptocurrencies never could tokens will win but trust wont lose
