even after getting clobbered in the last month cryptocurrency prices are still flying high investor interest in the nascent digital currency market remains strong and bitcoin cryptobtc and ethereum cryptoeth prices are up a respective  and  since the start of this is having a realworld impact on some businesses nvidia nasdaqnvda is a prime example it launched new hardware designed specifically for crypto mining the process in which digital assets are created and managed just a few months ago and sales are skyrocketingthe crypto industry is notoriously volatile though and this has created headaches for nvidia in the past but this isnt the semiconductor giants first rodeo this time around it has quite a bit more visibility into how the young crypto market is impacting it financiallya  million windfallnvidia announced the launch of a new chip lineup called the cmp cryptocurrency mining processor in feb  cmps are off to a hot startnvidia cfo colette kress said on the firstquarter fiscal  earnings call nvidias current fiscal year ends in jan  that cmp sales totaled  million pretty impressive for a fresh product launch thats only been available for a couple of months even from a semiconductor industry leader like nvidiain spite of wildly volatile crypto prices bitcoin and ethereum are each down about  from their alltime highs as of this writing kress said cmp sales are staying strong the company is forecasting cmp revenue of  million during the fiscal second quarter the threemonth period ending in july could crypto prices tank nvidiawhile a new chip contributing  million in quarterly sales is impressive this is still a relatively small number for nvidia the company is forecasting total revenue of  billion in the current quarter up a whopping  year over year cmp would thus be only about  of salesits nevertheless a notable new contributor to growth but its still video game and data center gpus that are the driving force here not cryptocurrencies gaming and data center sales were  of the total in the fiscal first quarterthe extra detail from nvidias top brass is a nice luxury though back in  plummeting prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies dragged nvidia along with them though designed for highend video game graphics many nvidia gpus are available for purchase through retailers and are programmable for other usesone such prominent usecase is crypto mining given the lack of visibility on who was making retail purchases it only became apparent after bitcoin tanked that many gaming gpus were actually getting scooped up by crypto miners and when bitcoin fell in price those miners stopped buyingcmp thus represents an important chip product it helps ensure the companys new rtx  gpus end up in the hands of actual gamers the rtx  can detect ethereum mining and cut computing power to make them less desirable to miners encouraging the purchase of a cmp unit instead it also helps nvidia get more insight on where its products are being used which should help with forecasting future financial resultsthat doesnt mean rtx  gpus arent getting bought up by crypto miners at all however the cmp lineup should help disaggregate video game sales from other end marketslong story short if crypto price volatility continues and cmp demand suddenly dries up investors have a clearer picture on how this will impact nvidia going forward though the company is deriving benefit from the digitalcurrency industry this is still first and foremost a video game and data center chip business
