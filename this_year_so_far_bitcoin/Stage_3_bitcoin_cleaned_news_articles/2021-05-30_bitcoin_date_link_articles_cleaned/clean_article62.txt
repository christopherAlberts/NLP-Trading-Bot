due to sebi’s silence on this issue “it’s still a grey area so it’s best to not to recommend to clients besides the banking support is also on the edge” says baig but he believes that cryptocurrencies are a good training ground for distributors to get ready for the future “it’s only when you start swimming do you really understand the depth of the water investing in cryptocurrencies even if it is my own money is a good training ground for me” says baigtesting watersstill anecdotally a majority of the distributors and advisors have stayed away from cryptocurrencies but the reality is that customers have started to ask questions and that industry officials say has nudged distributors to start reading up at the very least sadique neelgund founder of network fp a platform that helps financial planners build their businesses says “no matter how much we talk about mutual funds direct equity and fixed income investing advisors and distributors are also driven by their clients and needs and investors have begun to ask questions on cryptocurrencies” neelgund is openminded he says that the general tendency of the distributor and advisor fraternity is to write off something that they don’t deal in “that is not the logical way at the same time we should not be driven by fads we don’t know yet if there is any substance in cryptocurrencies but we should be open to learn distributors and advisors are waiting and watching” he sayslast year mumbaibased mutual funds distributor bhuvanaa shreeram wanted to send a gift to her nephews and nieces in the us for the vishu festival sending regular money would have meant applying for foreign exchange and finding someone to take it with them internet banking and united payments interface was out of question what to do she thought of buying bitcoins and sending them across “it was the whole rebellious nature behind why bitcoin was created that attracted me to it first” she says with a glee she didn’t send any bitcoin

investments she says that in the  life insurance corporation lic agents used to say “avoid stock market volatility and stick to goodold lic but mutual funds have successfully grown over the past  years the same thing is happening today many mf distributors now sayavoid bitcoin stick to mfs but this approach is regressive explore this crypto don’t just rubbish it without even about knowing it” she saysa mixed bagpunebased mutual funds distributor ramkumar agarwal didn’t have a good experience with cryptocurrencies agarwal prefers to test out investments with his own money first before recommending to his clients last year he bought bitcoin worth rs  he complains that the rate at which you get to buy cryptocurrencies may be vastly different from its international price “in india at the moment you can buy only cryptos available with indians the global supply is not available here hence on certain days liquidity could be a problem with some coins and you end up paying as much as two percent higher” says agarwal apart from this he says he has also faced problems when he wanted to transfer funds from his crypto exchange linked bank account to his normaluse bank accountand finally the aftersales service with some exchanges is a problem he adds “they do not have a phone number we have to email them and then wait for their responses if my money is stuck then i get hassled” he saysa growing section in the advisor community is gearing up for what they call a tsunami uncertainty still looms around cryptocurrencies india and many other countries around the world
