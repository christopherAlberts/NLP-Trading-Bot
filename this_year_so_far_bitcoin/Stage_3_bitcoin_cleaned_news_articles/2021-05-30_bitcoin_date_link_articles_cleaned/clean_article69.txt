billionaire investor stanley druckenmiller has recently explained why invested only  million in bitcoin btc skeptical of ethereum eth and prefers to pretend that dogecoin doge doesn’t exist at all“for the first move in bitcoin—i think from like  to —i just sat there aghast and  i wanted to buy it every day it was going up and—even though i didn’t think much of it—i just couldn’t stand the fact that it was going up and i didn’t own it” druckenmiller said in an interview with the hustle earlier this weekthe problem bitcoin solvesa few years ago druckenmiller famously said that bitcoin is a “solution in search of a problem” since then however he “evolved on this” thanks to a couple of occurrences first he finally realized what problem bitcoin aims to solve—and that problem was called “central banks”“i found the problem when we did the cares act and chairman powell started crossing all sorts of red lines in terms of what the fed would do and wouldn’t do the problem was jay powell and the world’s central bankers going nuts and making fiat money even more questionable than it already has been when i used to own gold” druckenmiller explainedultimately druckenmiller never owned any bitcoin while the crypto’s price grew from  to  and “felt like a moron” then a fellow billionaire paul tudor jones called him and said “do you know that when bitcoin went from  to   of the people that owned it at  never sold it”“well this was huge in my mind so here’s something with a finite supply and  of the owners are religious zealots i mean who the hell holds something through  to  and it turns out none of them—the — sold it add that to this new central bank craziness phenomenon” druckenmiller noted“an old elephant trying to get through a keyhole”finally he decided to buy  million worth of bitcoin at around —but ran into some issues however druckenmiller didn’t explain what those were“it took me  weeks to buy  million i bought it all around  i think and i said ‘this is ridiculous’ you know it takes me two weeks i can buy that much gold in  seconds” he lamented adding “so like an idiot i stopped buying it the next thing i knew  is trading at ”ultimately druckenmiller took “some costs and then some” out of his bitcoin investment—but still held on to an undisclosed amount of btc“my heart’s never been in it i’m a  old dinosaur but once it started moving and these institutions started upping it i could see the old elephant trying to get through the keyhole and they can’t fit through in time” he arguedethereum’s future is uncertainspeaking about ethereum and other cryptos druckenmiller argued that it will be “very very tough to unseat” bitcoin as the ultimate store of value among assets“i think bitcoin has won the store of value game because it is a brand it’s been around for  years and it has a finite supply is it going to be gold i don’t know it’s sure as hell doing a good imitation of it the last year or two” he pointed outmeanwhile druckenmiller lauded ethereum’s qualities as a “commerce facilitator” and the leading platform for smart contracts the billionaire however said he’s “a little more skeptical of whether it can hold its position”“it reminds me a little of myspace before facebook or maybe a better analogy is yahoo before google came along google wasn’t that much faster than yahoo but it didn’t need to be all it needed to be was a little bit faster and the rest is history” druckenmiller opinedfurther he argued that a completely new better payments system could emerge in the future and “there’s a chance that it hasn’t even been invented yet” meanwhile bitcoin will likely continue to be considered a store of value akin to gold“as long as jay powell keeps acting like he’s been acting i think gold and bitcoin—and bitcoin seems to be highbeta gold—are going to have the wind behind them” druckenmiller noted“i pretend doge doesn’t exist”dogecoin on the other hand doesn’t elicit any serious thought from druckenmiller at all despite numerous endorsements from billionaires such as elon musk or michael saylor doge is just a part of “this wave of money in the greater fool theory” he argued“now having said that i wouldn’t short it because i don’t like putting campfires out with my face so i just try and pretend doge doesn’t exist i think so little of it it doesn’t even bother me when it goes up” druckenmiller confessedlikewise he compared dogecoin to booming nonfungible tokens in the sense that “it’s a manifestation of the craziest monetary policy in history”“and i think since there’s no limit on supply i don’t really see the utility of  right now when bitcoin used to go up i’d go crazy because i didn’t own it when dogecoin goes up i just start laughing” said druckenmiller concluding “don’t go long and don’t go short i mean you know unless you like going to vegas then i guess it’s okay”get an edge on the cryptoasset market access more crypto insights and context in every article as a paid member of
