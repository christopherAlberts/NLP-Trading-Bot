would seem an odd juxtaposition to digital currencies however the company has a collection of offshore wind power projects in europe under way that will help to power the world with clean energy that could be used to mine for digital coins the companys clean energy business is only about  of adjusted ebitda today but it will grow in the years ahead thanks to investments like this and others including transporting hydrogenthats great but whats most interesting if you are tired of the volatility in the cryptocurrency space is the other  of adjusted ebitda roughly  comes from oil pipelines  from natural gas pipelines and  from a natural gas distribution business it is a north american category leader in each of these divisions and it is these operations and the reliable cash flows they generate that will provide the foundation for the companys future growth in renewable powerthe best part however is that because of the negative stigma attached to carbonbased businesses today

help shelter your portfolio from the often wild swings in the crypto worldfuture crypto mining could benefit this stockneha chamaria first solar cryptocurrencies have gotten crushed in recent weeks but if the heady mix of high potential returns with high risk still excites you forget crypto and consider investing in a solar stock thats gotten crushed as well but has a far more substantive growth

to participate in a potential onceinalifetime moneymaking opportunity unfortunately the promise of outsize returns almost always comes with a healthy dose of volatility if you have trouble stomaching wild price swings you might want to consider a less volatile company like brookfield infrastructurethe company owns a diversified portfolio of critical infrastructure like pipelines power lines ports toll roads and data centers most of these assets generate relatively steady cash flow backed by longterm fixedrate contracts that gives brookfield the money to pay an attractive dividend that currently yields however dont let the boring nature of brookfields business model fool you the company has an excellent track record of enriching investors since its formation more than a decade ago brookfield has generated an average total annual return of about  that enabled it to crush the sp  which has produced an  annualized total return during that timeframe put another way  invested in
