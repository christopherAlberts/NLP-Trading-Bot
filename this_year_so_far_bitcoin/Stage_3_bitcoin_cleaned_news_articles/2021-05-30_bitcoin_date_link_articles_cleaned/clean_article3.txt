hello everyonethis is a particularly emotional newsletter for me because it is the last crypto long  short that will be sent under my name i have some personal news after five exhilarating years at coindesk it is time to move on at the end of june after a few weeks off i’ll be joining genesis trading the coindesk sister company to continue synthesizing why all of what we are seeing mattersfor the briefing this week i decided to depart from the original format and share with you my main takeaways from the past five years it was hard to distill them down into something of readable length and there will no doubt be much that i regret having to leave out maybe one day i’ll do a part iithank you all so much for being a wonderful audience i will miss writing for you but i’m not going far away and i will probably pop up occasionally here and elsewhere at coindeskstay curious everyone – if you think the last five years were interesting you ain’t seen nothing yet– noellethe briefing what i’ve learned in the past five yearsthere’s an insider joke that isn’t really a joke that a month in crypto markets is like a year in normal time in terms of change in terms of the passage of time it feels like a week so you can understand the difficulty of looking back over five years and picking out highlights from a landscape that is blurred by speedyou’re reading crypto long  short a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets it goes out every sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view you can subscribe heredistinguishing new knowledge from that which was always known is also a challenge as in a field that encompasses so many fundamental concepts learnings rapidly become truthsso distilling what i’ve learned as i wind up five wonderful years at coindesk is too ambitious a task to even contemplate instead i humbly share just some of the things that popped into my head as i sat down to write this people dont understand moneyin the early days the question i most often got from traditional finance people was “but what backs bitcoin” i always responded with another question “what backs the dollar” the answers i got ranged from “the us gdp” to “the army” very few made the connection with the “full faith and credit” that backs government debt or even with the “in god we trust” that is printed on the dollar bill a few probing questions later most eventually arrived at the realization that “faith” backs the dollar – faith in the us gdp the army and ultimately the us government when they get there it’s just a short step to accepting that a cryptocurrency backed by faith is not such a ridiculous ideait always surprised me that the fiercest resistors to this notion tended to be people well trained in economic and investment principles i should have realized that firmly held notions are the hardest to relinquish this brings me to the second point the questions matter more than the answersthe progress of science is about the search for explanations this need to understand also gave birth to faith we can’t build on an “i don’t know” so if research can’t give us an answer we imbue higher beings with an omniscience and control that absolves us from needing to comprehendthis is prevalent in all aspects of life including economics and politics and most end up accepting the wisdom handed down over generations and through textbooks traditional schooling teaches us to memorize rather than question the answers we are givenevery now and then tools emerge that enable us to probe deeper than ever before blockchain technology is one of those tools it forces us to ask such questions as “what is money” what is consensus why does it matter how far should the authorities be able to go to curtail our financial freedom why do capital markets restrict access to opportunitythese questions are the tip of a multilayered iceberg and bring us to point three our industry needs more philosophersit already has some – craig warmke and andrew bailey are making great contributions i’m sure there are others – but more would be even better understanding the true transformational potential of crypto assets requires some uncomfortably deep questioning of principles we mistakenly assume we understandbitcoin for example is a bearer asset – like the dollar bill you hold it you own it some people don’t see why this is a big deal others get excited at the reminder both reactions are based on an assumption of the right to private property this has not always been a given in human history but is something that we all today take for granted a hundred years from now what will we take for granted that seems totally farfetched today and of the things we take for granted today what might we losethere are so many assumptions that we don’t even know we hold but which – when questioned – open up huge vistas of innovation for instance many projects are trying to “fix identity” but what is identity who decides can society function with each of us deciding for ourselves or does a centralized authority dictate parameters for the purpose of interoperability and universal acceptanceso many of the solutions that have flashed across our radars disappeared just as quickly because they weren’t solving actual problems or weren’t going deep enough applying some philosophical principles can help with the focus which brings us to the next point the why matters more than the howok the how matters a lot too but when you lose sight of the why the how gets diverted to a path of convenience and compromisewhen faced with daily deadlines competing personal interests and a desire to please it’s so easy to focus on shortterm wins we pat ourselves on the back and get into the habit of seeking out the next one often losing sight of why we started on our journey in the first placesmall wins are good progress is better and progress is best measured against big goals the bigger the goal though the larger the obstacles which introduces the next point barriers are constructivejust like that old saying that you can tell the quality of a person by the quality of his or her enemies the same goes for innovative projects the scope of an ambition is often defined by the obstacles in its wayanyone who has ever tried to build something new will tell you how frustrating it can be there are no exceptions but those who make it learn to see the barriers as opportunities we can try to change the barriers by working with those who created them or we can work around them which often leads to new barriers emerging but who knows maybe these are easier to work with the process always leads to new discoveries which can strengthen good ideas or transform weak onesin the end it’s the goal that matters and deep passion tends to feed the stamina needed to keep going nothing worthwhile was ever easy it’s ok to have fun while being totally seriousdogecoin nfts rappers and athletes … it’s not hard to understand why many think our industry is immature when they see attention gravitate toward the cute and the glitzy and a tweet from a billionaire moves the marketyet dismissing anything as superficial without scratching the surface to see what’s underneath is an easy reflex that misses an opportunity to glimpse a bigger picturethe cute and the glitzy are outlets of selfexpression that have value for many a whole generation of investors is finding a new voice with collective influence and their criteria for allocation draws on different inspiration and of course a tweet can move a market that runs on narrative – sentiment changes often however in either direction that in itself is both a part of and a result of the crypto market’s compelling storyour industry will always have the wacky and the bewildering they are often a sign of froth and sometimes there are dubious ethics or even scams at play but not always when viewed through a bigpicture lens they can shed light on both the why and the how of the change this technology is inspiring they may divert attention from the solid construction and rigorous research going on behind the scenes but that shouldn’t matter – the potential of cryptographic and blockchain technology is vast and will be better off with a greater variety of ideas stretching it in different directionsfinally speaking of variety the industry will succeed because of the people in itthat’s youif you joined our amazing consensus  event this week you’ve glimpsed the sheer breadth of talent from all sectors bringing different perspectives and experiences to the table our ranks now span geographies demographics and specializationsentrepreneurs regulators artists analysts athletes lawyers designers economists traders investors developers and writers are just some of the people who have joined us on stage on screen and in our reporting over the yearsand even if you don’t fit into any of those classifications even if you have not yet worked in our industry or on a related project the fact that you’re reading this means that you too are part of the change we’re working on whatever your contribution your presence here is valued and your input is welcomein almost all areas of life diversity brings resilience – whether we’re working together arguing or competing we make the landscape stronger and that should be why we’re here in the first placethe bitcoin mining council misunderstandings vigilance and steps forwardthe intensifying criticism of bitcoin for its environmental footprint reached its mainstream peak last week when elon musk tweeted skepticism about bitcoin’s longterm viability under current conditions microstrategy ceo michael saylor reached out to him to ask if he had spoken to any miners on the issue he responded no but he would like to and so michael saylor set up the meeting convening many of north america’s largest bitcoin minersthe result was the creation of the bitcoin mining council which set off a barrage of criticism how dare they have a closeddoor meeting who are they to form a council surely the next step is miner collusion and possibly even network censorshipas saylor explained on our consensus panel this week the objective was to get musk to listen to the miners explain their energy mixes and strategy the result was a determination to improve the objective data around bitcoin mining energy consumption and to encourage bitcoin miners around the world to move toward renewable energyboth steps would be positive for the industry actual data rather than anecdote and secondhand reporting would enable us to track the industry’s evolution and could help finally put to bed the allegations that bitcoin mining is mainly based on “dirty” fuel and more miners taking the conversation seriously could move the needle toward a greater composition of renewable energy sources in the mining mix which would also assuage the industry criticsbut the bitcoin community is sensitive to any whiff of centralization as it should be this harsh scrutiny is also positive for the industry it keeps it “honest” and makes sure that any attempt to circumvent the network’s decentralization and censorship resistance will be met with such a loud reaction that it will ultimately failsaylor musk and the miners are almost certainly not thinking of breaking the protocol’s decentralization – that would weaken bitcoin’s value in which they are all heavily invested also as saylor pointed out if he wanted to have a “secret” meeting he wouldn’t have told the world about itbut the community is right to cry foul at the slightest suspicion as decentralization gets eroded by stealth often accidentally but usually irreversibly we saw this with the evolution of the internetpersonally i find both the saylormusk initiative and the community’s reaction encouraging and comforting we have actionminded people working on solutions to serious problems and we have the community making sure it doesn’t overstep we’re in good hands on both sideschain linksthis week saw two renowned investors confirm interest in crypto asset investments in conversation with our chief content officer michael casey at consensus this week ray dalio admitted to holding bitcoin and in an interview on bloomberg carl icahn said that he was looking into making a potentially large investment around  billion in the crypto markets takeaway the growing involvement of respected names such as these not only triggers deeper research by other investors who start to worry they might be left behind it also removes any career risk for fund managers thinking about suggesting crypto asset investments to their clients andor bossesfederal reserve governor lael brainard kicked off consensus this week with some prepared remarks that echoed what federal reserve chairman jerome powell said last week – that private stablecoins posed a risk to consumers takeaway this is worth keeping an eye on as negative regulation of stablecoins such as usdc and usdt tether could negatively impact asset prices given they are the source of much of the market’s liquidity a ban is unlikely and impractical and the posturing could just be stage setting for the eventual rollout of central bank digital currencies but it is a market risk especially given the spectacular growth of stablecoin supply over the past year alonesource coin metricstwo leading wall street investment banks have initiated coverage of coinbase nasdaq coin jpmorgan gives it an “overweight” rating and a price target of  per share up over  from  at time of writing while goldman sachs classifies it as a “buy” and has a price target of  up almost  from price at time of writing both cite the favorable outlook for the crypto market with goldman sachs paying particular attention to the potential of decentralized finance takeaway regular readers will have heard me say this before one of the main results from the public listing of coinbase is the need for mainstream analysts to get up to speed fast on the crypto industry this signals “acceptability” and favorable coverage like this on coinbase enhances the visibility of the crypto market as a potential investment areacrypto exchange coinbase has hired a former goldman sachs cohead of government affairs faryar shirzad as its new chief policy officer takeaway this comes on the heels of coinbase cofounder and ceo brian armstrong’s public tour of the capital’s power brokers earlier this month pushing for procrypto legislation is positive but we need to make sure that it does not lead to regulatory capture which favors the large companies in the industry at the expense of the smaller ones that would centralize influence which is precisely what the concept was created to avoidone river digital asset management has filed with the sec for a bitcoin etf that would be carbon neutral – it would buy and dispose of carbon credits to account for the emissions associated with the bitcoin in the fund takeaway well this is one way to embrace the environmental debate around bitcoin mining the problem is that carbon offsets are still a controversial workaround and the “greenwashing” here feels a bit like marketing what’s more former sec chairman jay clayton – yes he who steadfastly refused to approve any bitcoin etf on his watch – is an adviser to the fund management company
