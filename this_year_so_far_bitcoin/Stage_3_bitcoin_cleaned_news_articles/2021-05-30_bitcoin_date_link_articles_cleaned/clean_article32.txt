when india’s  pandemic was raging towards its peak in midmay vitalik buterin the  founder of ethereum donated cryptocurrency worth  billion to support pandemic relief work in india our astonished media didn’t know what to make of this some reported it as the singlelargest philanthropic contribution to help covidafflicted indians whereas others thought it was a bit of a joke especially since the cryptocurrency donated was shiba inu one of a growing number of “meme digital currencies”many indians are understandably sceptical about the very idea of cryptocurrency how can there be any kind of currency that isn’t backed up by a sovereign state and a public institution like a central bank but there is and it’s valuable enough to shake up financial markets the pioneer cryptocurrency bitcoin which traded at just   in  commanded a market price of just under  this april many newer coins were introduced since bitcoin’s launch and their cumulative market value touched   trillion this may within a span of just over a decade their value has surpassed the size of economies of most modern nationschina’s recent crackdown on cryptocurrency had farreaching consequences an astounding trillion us dollars were wiped out from the global cryptomarket within a span of  hours remarkably this is a reversal of a fraction of the gains made by this sector since the onset of  in january  the “cryptomarket” grew by over  per cent even while the pandemic unleashed global economic carnage not seen since the great depression within two days of the chinaprovoked crash the value of the cryptomarket again recovered by over  per centthis kind of extreme volatility has always been a concern for regulators and investors alike when satoshi nakamoto created the most popular cryptocurrency bitcoin in  as a fully decentralised peertopeer electronic cash system that didn’t need the purview of any thirdparty financial institution he was responding to the lack of trust in the existing banking system reflected in the global financial crisis that year initially governments did not know how to react but as with the growth of the internet the advent of cryptocurrency has been one of the extraordinary stories of modern economic history and no country can remain untouched by itin india as always the reflex action is to bar what you can’t understand ban what you can’t control law enforcement and taxation agencies have clamoured for a ban expressing wariness of these being used as instruments for illicit activities including money laundering and terror funding in  the reserve bank barred our financial institutions from supporting crypto transactions — but the supreme court overturned it in  yet indian banks still block these transactions and the government has circulated a draft bill outlawing all cryptocurrency activities which has been under discussion since regulation is definitely needed to prevent serious problems to ensure that cryptocurrencies are not misused and to protect unsuspecting investors from excessive market volatility and possible scams but like all effective regulation it needs to be clear transparent coherent and animated by a vision of what it seeks to achieve nobody in india has been able to tick these boxes and we’re in danger of missing out in the global race altogetherdespite there being no announced policy in place the reserve bank has announced the launch of a private blockchainsupported official digital currency similar to the digital yuan india is increasingly mimicking china’s paradoxical attempt to centralise a decentralised ecosystem our government is trying to decouple cryptocurrencies from their underlying blockchain technology and still derive benefit unfortunately this is impractical and shows a lack of understanding of this disruptive innovationthe basic architecture of blockchain is a network where people share the extra space and computational power in their computers to create a global supercomputer that is accessible to everyone this network performs functions such as verification of transactions and contracts and the updating and maintenance of these records in the form of tamperproof ledgers these tasks are normally done by large intermediary organisations like banks law firms and public institutions participants of a network are known as validators and they are rewarded for their efforts by transaction fees in the form of tokens or coinsat the moment intermediaries including banks credit card and payment gateways draw almost  per cent from the total global economic output of over  trillion as fees for their services integrating blockchain into these sectors could result in hundreds of billions of dollars in savings blockchain could make every aspect of egovernance judicial and electoral processes more efficient and transparenttech firms including titans like google and facebook derive most of their value from their multitude of users blockchain could enable these internet customers to receive micropayments for any original data they share in the digital space including ratings reviews and images our digital space would thereby become more redistributive and fairer thousands of companies across the globe are working on projects that could bring in such paradigm changes in just the first quarter of  blockchain startups worldwide received venture funding of   billion more than what they raised in all four quarters in meanwhile the funds that have gone into the indian blockchain startups are less than  per cent of the amount the sector raised globally the current central government approach makes it nearimpossible for entrepreneurs and investors to acquire much economic benefitany new regulations made in this sector should prevent the misuse of these digital assets without hindering innovation and investments provisions have to be made to route the value extracted from these networks transparently into our financial system indian investors are said to hold some rs  crore in digital currency already as the financial pages report mounting anxiety among investors about the regulatory uncertainties plaguing india’s position on cryptocurrency the need for clearheaded policymaking has never been greaterindia was a late adopter in all the previous phases of the digital revolution – when semiconductors the internet and smartphones made their mark we had to play catchup as we are still doing on  and  we are currently on the cusp of the next phase which would be led by technologies like blockchain we have the potential to channel our human capital expertise and resources into this revolution and emerge as one of the winners of this wave all we need to do is to get our policymaking rightthis column first appeared in the print edition on
