it’s important to understand the tax consequences of cryptocurrency and blockchain from cryptocurrency compliance to nft we explain what you need to know in this week’s insights roundupbut first some background in  i was following a story about an alleged online black market known as silk road where buyers and sellers conducted all transactions with bitcoin it was the first time that i had heard about cryptocurrency and i was fascinated as agents from irs criminal investigation explained it to metoday you can’t pick up a newspaper or click on a website without hearing a reference to cryptocurrency and blockchain the market cap for cryptocurrency is reportedly over  trillion with the most valuable being bitcointhe embossed word bitcoin sits on the edge of bitcoins stacked in this arranged photograph in danbury uk photographer chris ratcliffebloomberg via getty imagesbitcoin is a digital currency meaning that instead of a coin that you can hold in your hand it’s essentially a computer file you can save it in your digital wallet on your computer use it to buy goods or services or exchange it for other digital currencies or cash using a platform what makes it so attractive is that each of these transactions is memorialized on the blockchainthink of blockchain like a ledger that’s something that those of us in the tax and accounting worlds are familiar with using but instead of recording your ledger items on a paper or a computer spreadsheet with blockchain you hold information or data in blocks that data includes the time and sequence of the transactions—just like your manual ledger entries wouldwhen those blocks are filled they don’t disappear they attach to a new block creating a chain the whole sequence is referred to as the blockchain thanks to technology the chains irrevocably link together so that you can’t easily delete or alter themwhen you buy or trade bitcoin on its blockchain that transaction is recorded and since bitcoin’s blockchain is decentralized other users can watch as transactions occur when a transaction happens every computer on the network notes the change that transparency is part of the appealbut don’t confuse transparency with making your information public users can see the transactions but not necessarily identify the persons making the transactions that’s because you use a code—called a public key—to record the transactions on the blockchain and not your name or other personal detailsthe complexity of blockchain—and the speed at which transactions can occur without a middleman—has made determining the tax consequences tricky the irs didn’t even offer guidance to taxpayers on how to treat bitcoin—and other virtual currency—for federal income tax purposes until  the irs eventually weighed in that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are considered capital assetsnow more industries are watching how bitcoin uses blockchain and considering how that technology could be used outside of digital currency we’re already seeing that happen with nonfungible tokens or nfts that adds yet another layer of complexitywhat does this mean for tax professionals clearly there’s a lot to consider from tax
