 was a huge year for tech stocks some highgrowth names doubled tripled or more in size so far  hasnt been nearly as kind as expectations for many of these companies realign with realitynevertheless that doesnt mean the growth story is over a new digitalfirst era is emerging and some stocks could double again in  three that have that kind of potential are square nysesq applied materials nasdaqamat and lam research nasdaqlrcxforget the crypto boom and bust cycle digital payments are a growth industrynicholas rossolillo square square has gotten a lot of attention because of its sizable bitcoin holdings on its balance sheet and skyrocketing bitcoin revenue from trading on cash app a square subsidiary even after falling some  from alltime highs bitcoin is still up nearly  since the start of  no wonder square stock has gained about  in that same span of timebut square is far more than a bet on the cryptocurrency craze square is cleverly using cash apps bitcoin trading capability to onboard a massive number of new users cheaply once theyre in its ecosystem it can crosssell other functionality like digital payments and peertopeer money movement a debit card linked to a cash app account a newly acquired tax prep service or integration with squares extensive merchant networksquare is still getting a big boost from cash apps yearoveryear lapping of prepandemic financial results cash app revenue excluding bitcoinrelated income was up  to  million in the first quarter of  that incredible pace will no doubt slow as  progresses but another catalyst is set to take over the square seller ecosystem which was deeply impacted by pandemic lockdowns last year when many merchants that use square were forced to temporarily close the seller ecosystem segment grew  year over year to  billion in  but will likely accelerate in the next couple quarterson a freecashflow basis square isnt profitable  at least not yet its spending heavily right now to maximize its expansion in the digital payments and financial technology space free cash flow was a meager  million on revenue of  billion over the last  months but square will be highly profitable eventually gross profit margin was  in  when excluding bitcoin effects a huge increase from  a year ago as it acquired plenty of new users growing both the top and bottom lines at a fast rate it wouldnt be unthinkable for square to double in value again this year from its current market cap of  billionearly innings of decadelong growth trendsanders bylund applied materials semiconductor equipment and materials supplier applied materials has gained more than  over the last  weeks boosted by a global shortage of chipmaking capacity faced with limited manufacturing options many microchip designers are paying top dollar for the materials and processes they can get their hands on today applied materials sales grew  year over year in last weeks secondquarter report and profit margins are on the rise and thats just the beginning of a longterm growth trend according to ceo gary dickersonwere still in the early innings of major secular trends that will play out over the next decade and drive the semiconductor and semiequipment markets structurally higher dickerson said on the earnings call for the first time customers are providing capital spending guidance for multiple years into the future which is a new leading indicator for demand sustainabilityapplied materials stock returns are supported by fantastic business results the stock doesnt look expensive after that massive  rush trading at a modest  times forward earnings and seven times trailing sales this company enjoys both an artificial shortterm boost from the semiconductor shortage situation and a healthy longterm growth market i would not be surprised to see applied materials shares doubling again before the end of the year and its also a solid stock to own for the long haulthis stock enables the big data erabilly duberstein lam research semiconductor equipment leader lam research is up  over the past year but i wouldnt be surprised to see its stock double again ceck out these recent quarterly numbers in  revenue rocketed  year over year while earnings per share grew an even higher  not only that but management also guided for strong sequential growth for the current quarterdespite these blockbuster results lam research only trades at roughly  times forward earnings estimates thats cheaper than all of the faang stocks and the overall market despite lam posting superior growth metrics i also think the average earnings estimate may be conservativeits true that lam has been a somewhat cyclical business in the past and in weak years revenue can flatten out or even decline with the semi cycle yet the longterm trend in both revenue and profits is clearly upwith the massive demand were currently seeing due to the semiconductor shortage some might think these results are as good as things are going to get and yet theres a good possibility the strong growth for lam will continue for the next few yearsthe pandemic has accelerated digitization trends that were already going on across the industry and with nextgeneration tech like  ai wearables and the internet of things semiconductor growth is likely to strongly outpace overall economic growth for the foreseeable future add in the fact that advanced nations all wish to now have some extra semiconductor capacity on their own shores and it looks like nothing but good news for the semicap industry for the foreseeable futurein addition advanced semiconductors are running up against the limits of physics so producing smaller more advanced chips is becoming more capitalintensive with each generation for instance when nand flash modules hit their limits in terms of twodimensional shrink lams etch and deposition machines became crucial for stacking nand layers in  structures  a trend that continues today over the next few years more  architectures are likely to be implemented in logic chips and perhaps even dram lam is a leader in these machines and has taken market share in recent years so id expect that high performance to continuefinally strong systems sales today are paving the way for strong services growth in the future spanning upgrades spare parts and highmargin services which help optimize production and maximize yields for customers lams services revenue which makes up about onethird of overall revenue is more tied to its installed base and should grow even if machine sales hit a soft patchwith lam earning an outstanding  on invested capital growing over  and trading at a cheaper valuation than the broader market id expect lam to outperform and possibly double over the next year
