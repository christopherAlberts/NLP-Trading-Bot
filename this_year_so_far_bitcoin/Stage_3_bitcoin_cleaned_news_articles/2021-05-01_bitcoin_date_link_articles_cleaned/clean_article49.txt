some major changes could be coming soon to a central bank near you with an estimated  of them at some stage of developing a central bank digital currency or cbdc in october  the bahamas became the first economy to introduce its own cbdc the sand dollar but many more national currencies are expected to be rolled out in the coming yearsi have much more to say on this but first let’s get an update on official gold purchases since  central banks have been net buyers of the yellow metal as they seek to mitigate risk and hedge against their very own monetary decisionsthat being so  is off to a rough start in terms of official purchases central banks were net sellers in january and february for the first time in over a decade unloading some  metric tons according to the world gold council wgc this has contributed to gold’s poor performance so far this year falling  through last friday turkey was the biggest seller dumping  tons in february aloneclick to enlargenot all central banks were sellers india bought  tons in february uzbekistan  tons serbia has been accumulating gold every month since february the magyar nemzeti bank mnb the central bank of hungary announced earlier this month that it tripled its holdings from  metric tons to  tons putting hungary first among central and eastern european cee countries in terms of gold reserves per capita“as it carries no credit or counterparty risks gold facilitates reinforming trust in a country in all economic environments which still renders it one of the most crucial reserve assets worldwide” the bank wrote in a press releasechina to allow large gold importswhen it comes to gold policy though the big news is that china is now allowing domestic and international banks to import large amounts of the precious metal into the country in an effort to support prices according to reporting by reuters an estimated  metric tons worth  billion will be shipped into china as soon as this month or nextfor the sake of comparison in  china imported around  tons per month or  billionthe country is already the world’s largest importer of the metal so this is an important development that i believe could help the gold price stay buoyantold meets new will cash take the digital divebesides holding gold—one of the oldest known assets having been mined for over  years—many central banks are now on a path to introduce their own digital currencies something our ancestors could never have conceivedmore than  central banks right now are believed to be exploring the idea of cbdcs including retail tokens that would be used by citizens as well as wholesale applications for financial institutionsbut first what is a cbdc and what isn’t itsimply put cbdcs are digital payment instruments that like traditional fiat currency are issued by a central bank and denominated in the national unit of account the hope is that they will allow for safe and secure transactions and provide a transparent audit trail while also featuring a level of confidentialityanother benefit no more having to break bills many people have shied away from using dirty paper cash during the pandemic but in years past americans would lose some  million every year in loose changefor now cbdcs appear to be designed not to replace traditional cash but to supplement it nor do they seem to threaten the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin whose price is far too volatile to be used as an everyday medium of exchange earlier this month federal reserve bank of dallas president robert kaplan called bitcoin a “store of value” like gold rather than a currencyhaving said that many merchants now accept bitcoin as payment the most notable perhaps being tesla visa and paypal already let customers use cryptos to settle transactions and last week paypalowned venmo said it will permit crypto trading miami mayor francis suarez wants to allow residents to pay their taxes in bitcoinsome central banks are ahead of others in launching a cbdc like i said the bahamas has the sand dollar while cambodia has the bakong goldloving china has reportedly been working on a digital yuan since  and recently it doled out millions of dollars’ worth of the prototype currency to people in shenzhen and other cities to test drive meanwhile britain’s treasury and the bank of england boe announced last week the creation of a taskforce to look into what some people are calling the “britcoin”click to enlargeno cash no problemtransitioning to digital currencies is easier when the country already has a history of preferring online payments to paper cash take sweden and norway two of the most cashless societies both nordic countries are currently working on their own cbdcsas some of you may know sweden was the world’s first country in  to issue paper money today it’s set to become one of the first to introduce a digital token the ekrona possibly as early as november  the move follows years of declines in the amount of banknotes and coins circulating in the swedish economy only around  of transactions are believed to be made using physical cashclick to enlargein neighboring norway that figure is even lower at between  and  in a press release published last thursday the norges bank says it plans to “test technical solutions for a central bank digital currency cbdc over the next two years”bitcoin dominance drops opening the door to other cryptosagain cbdcs are not expected to compete with cryptos such as bitcoin which is taking its place as a tradeable asset like goldthe world’s largest cryptocurrency
