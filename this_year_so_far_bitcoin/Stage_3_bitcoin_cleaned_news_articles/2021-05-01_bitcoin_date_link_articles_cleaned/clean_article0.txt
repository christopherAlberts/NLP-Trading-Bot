but there will be a constant and predictable supply of bitcoin until the last one is mined in cuban points out that unlike bitcoin you can print more money companies can produce more shares but you know exactly how many bitcoins will ever exist that scarcity is one thing it has in common with gold its also durable portable and divisible  all qualities that make for a good store of valueon the
