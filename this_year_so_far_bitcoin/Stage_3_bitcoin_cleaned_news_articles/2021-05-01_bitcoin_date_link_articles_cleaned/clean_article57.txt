investors have piled into companies that are focused on green energy solutions among these  top performers are solar panel producer sunworks renewable natural gas and fuels company aemetis lidar sensor developer microvision which is used for autonomous driving and electric vehicle ev charging products and service network company blink chargingalternative energy stocks have pretty much been off to the races since early november president joe bidens victory in november coupled with democrats taking back the senate by the narrowest of margins in january has paved the way for clean energy legislation to fight climate change the expectation is that we could see clean energy companies winning sizable contracts under the biden administration andor basking in healthy tax creditsunfortunately alternative energy stocks also look to be in a bit of a bubble all nextbigthing investments encounter adoption hurdles yet investors never seem to learn their lesson and expect a flawless uptake and adoption of new technologiesblink charging is a particularly worrisome company given its minimal revenue and lack of investment in research and development there doesnt seem to be much of a barrier to entry that would prevent other companies from directly competing with blinks charging networks or ev infrastructurecrypto has investors and speculators fascinatedanother bigtime share price driver over the trailing year is cryptocurrency the rapidly rising price of bitcoin ethereum dogecoin and other digital currencies has sent investors and speculators into cryptocurrency mining stocks marathon digital and riot blockchaincryptocurrency miners are people or businesses that use highpowered computers to solve complex mathematical equations for groups of transactions known as a block doing so validates these transactions and nets the mining company a block reward both marathon digital and riot blockchain focus on mining bitcoin thus the higher the price of bitcoin the more the  bitcoin block reward will be worthwhile both companies intend to hold on to the bitcoin they mine marathon digital went a step further and purchased  million worth of bitcoin in late january for an average price of  per token marathon is already up more than  million on this purchasethe issue with cryptocurrency stocks like marathon digital and riot blockchain is that theyre arguably the worst way to gain cryptobitcoin exposure theres virtually no barrier to entry which means competition continues to increase at the same time bitcoins block rewards halve every couple of years tack on bitcoins wild volatility and concerns about this operating models longterm validity comes into questionreddit investors are making their presence knownmany of these topperforming stocks have also been favorite momentum plays of retail investors on reddits wallstreetbets chatroom of course none stands out more than video game and accessories retailer gamestop which would have turned a  bet into more than  million in  monthsbeginning in midjanuary reddits retail investors began banding together and focusing their attention on companies with very high levels of short interest with the goal of effecting a short squeeze as the only publicly traded company at the time with a tripledigit percentage short interest relative to float gamestop became the posterchild of the shortsqueeze movementwhats been unique about gamestop is that its been able to maintain a large portion of its gains despite its underlying business and fundamentals coming nowhere close to supporting its valuation this is a company mired in a downward revenue spiral thats on track to lose money for a fourth consecutive year gamestop simply waited too long to transition to a digital gaming model and now its paying the price for its tardinessemotions have kept the companys share price irrational longer than many expected eventually though operating results always drive share price performancedont forget about biotech gamechangerslastly its not uncommon to find biotech stocks among the top performers over a trailing year any clinicalstage company that could potentially put itself on the map with a blockbuster treatment has an opportunity to be a topperforming stock the big question is if these biotech stocks hang on to their gainsleading the pack over the trailing year is ocugen though the company has historically focused on developing treatments aimed at curing blindness diseases its claim to fame of late is a coronavirus disease   vaccine covaxin developed in cooperation with bharat biotechless than two weeks ago bharat shared the second interim analysis of a phase   study involving covaxin thats being conducted in india the data showed a  vaccine effectiveness after the second dose with efficacy against severe  disease of  this  figure suggests that covaxin could be quite effective against the multiple variants of the diseasefor ocugen to maintain or grow its market cap following a greater than  move higher its going to need the us food and drug administration fda to greenlight covaxin in the us based on the large trial in india thats not a given which is what makes ocugen a waitandseetype stock
