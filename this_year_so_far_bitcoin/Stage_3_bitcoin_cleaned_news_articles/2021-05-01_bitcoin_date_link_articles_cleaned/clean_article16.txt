ushered into existence by google engineer charlie lee on october   litecoin is the  largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization todaylitecoin coin is an og crypto aside from bitcoin no other coin has stayed in the top ten longer btc and ltc have held places in the charts for  and  weeks respectively other top performers include xrp at  weeks and eth at it was created following a source code fork of the bitcoin core blockchain a fork is when a blockchain diverges into two separate paths creating two distinct coins litecoin’s biggest differences from bitcoin includelower transaction fees a different hashing algorithm a decreased block generation time an increased maximum cap of coinsdon’t be deterred well get into the specifics of these differences below and also have a look at how these factors contributed to litecoins success as a more spendable cryptocurrency you may have heard bitcoin described as “digital gold” and following that line of thinking litecoin could be considered “digital silver” but the cryptocurrency’s history isn’t as spotless as you might thinkin an april  interview with cnbc’s worldwide exchange lee discussed litecoin comparing and contrasting its attributes with those of bitcoin although lee is something of a polarizing entity in the cryptosphere it’s worth hearing what he has to say about the cryptocurrency he invented let’s dive incryptosavvy is an occasional series from inverse that explains the world of cryptocurrency and where it’s going nextlitecoin vs bitcointhe value of litecoin over the past two years coindeskone of the main differences between the two cryptocurrencies is transaction fees  cryptocurrency miners choose to validate the transactions that pay the most the current average transaction fee for litecoin at the time of writing is just  with bitcoin that number is much higher with its average transaction fee being the bitcoin blockchain is congested says lee everyone is competing to get their transactions into the next block and the way they do that is by paying more feesanother fundamental difference between litecoin and bitcoin is their mining algorithms  litecoin employs scrypt one of the first hashing algorithms implemented on blockchain networks developers of scrypt intended it to be an improvement on an even earlier hashing algorithm  the one used by bitcoin lee chose scrypt for good reason but we have to take a deeper look at cryptocurrency mining to understand whythe basics mining can be performed using a central processing unit cpu graphics processing unit gpu or applicationspecific integrated circuit asic miners asic miners have the advantage of being able to solve the complex data strings needed to mine think win the block much quicker – generating considerably more hashes think tries per second than cpus or gpusconsequently bitcoin mining using the more expensive and hardtofind asics is now a sort of arms race on april  core scientific the largest mining pool in north america announced it had bought  antminer mining machines from asic manufacturer bitmain core scientifics ceo says this most recent purchase could help his company increase its global share of bitcoin’s hash rate from  to  to be clear this would mean one organization could plausibly be processing more than  of all the bitcoin blocks and in the opinion of many this goes against a philosophy at the very core of cryptocurrencies decentralizationthis is where litecoin’s hashing algorithm comes in lee went with scrypt because the algorithm is less susceptible to asic mining while over the years scrypt asic miners have become more prevalent the majority of the mining on the litecoin blockchain still uses cpus and gpus making it much more accessible to the average person and less susceptible to “control” by aforementioned centralized mining pools“digital gold” versus “digital silver”shutterstockin his cnbc interview lee also explains why he calls litecoin the digital silver to bitcoins digital gold as we know throughout history both gold and silver have been used as currencies and because gold is worth so much more than silver its better suited for bigticket items gold is the most marketable good when large values are traded like buying a car with silver being the most marketable good for smaller transactions buying groceriesarguably this “spendability” is what lee is referring to with this “digital silver” narrative because of the low transaction fees for litecoin the coin can be used more readily transactions on the litecoin network also happen faster  than those on the bitcoin network on average every  minutes as opposed to  minutes for bitcoinbut from a technical standpoint its not all good news while the litecoin network may be four times faster there are also four times as many coins  as per coin market cap the current circulating supply of ltc is  with the max supply being  conversely the circulating supply of btc is  with the max supply being for litecoin this could be viewed as a negative attribute because part of the reason bitcoin is so valuable is its scarcity and this scarcity is why the top cryptocurrency by market cap is often touted as being the ultimate hedge against inflationthat said things could be worse there’s no limit or max supply cap on ethereums native cryptocurrency ether or another recent favorite dogecoin instead supply increases every year while supporters of ether might be quick to point out that there are proposed monetary policies in the works aimed at curbing inflation over time without relying on a supply cap nothing concrete has materialized yet as ethereum’s monetary policy is in flux“why do people hate ltc”as touched on briefly in the introduction a contributing factor to the antilitecoin sentiment surrounds its founder lee who sold all of his ltc holdings in december  when the coin was nearing its alltime high of  it is for this reason some people accuse him of pumping and dumping his holdings for his own personal benefitanother perspective according to ilir gashi in their medium piece “defeating the fud charlie lee selling his litecoin due to conflict of interest” is that lee “sold his litecoins due to a growing perceived conflict of interest” gashi’s article goes on to provide specific reasons that help “clarify why lee selling was the best thing for litecoin moving forward to remain decentralized”this explanation makes sense distancing oneself from a project to alleviate concerns of conflict of interest is sometimes par for the course in business and seems like a pretty legitimate reason for lee’s salea quick google search reveals a reddit thread titled “why do people hate ltc the thread helps shed some more light on where this antilitecoin sentiment comes from as per contributors this perspective stems primarily from socalled “bitcoin maximalists” – btc supporters who believe the bitcoin network provides any and everything that investors want or need in a digital currency some of them see litecoin as just a copypaste version of the worlds leading cryptoperhaps at first glance theres some truth to that but in reality when one dives a little deeper and as i think i have shown in this piece there are several significant differences use cases and applications for both coins don’t  me
