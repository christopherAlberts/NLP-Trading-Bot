the way we traditionally perceive money is at its root misguided as money is what allows humans to experience valuethe root of all evilfor my entire life to the best of my memory i can recall one persistent narrative“for the love of money is the root of all evil therefore selfishness must be the seed” — m d birmingham which is a take on the quote from  timothy in the most recent decade of my time among the living i have learned how this belief is wildly misguided allow me to defend my reasonings whythe ultimate currencyin the grand scheme of things money has played a massively important role in the development and progress of history from the use of seashells as a “money” to the gold coins of rome or the first fiat currency — the jiaozi of the song dynasty in china — to the us dollar today money has played a pivotal role for humanitywhat money has done what made it so revolutionary was that it allowed our species to give physical form to our time and our energyplease take the time to consider that thoughttimethe passage of time is one thing that we can never get back once it has been spent there’s no refund time is the ultimate currency forever passing without the ability to return to a prior moment ever passing ever spent ultimately and unequivocally finitewhether you go to work every day or you have a hobby that allows you to make a profit from your efforts  you are monetizing your time and your effort that was invested into that job or hobby that’s precisely what a wage or salary represents — the opportunity cost for your time every hour that you sacrifice to a job you make a decision that the time you sacrifice is worth the monetary exchange you earn in returnlet me make this clear a wage is a trade where you determine that your time is worth the amount you are being compensated for whether that amount seems low or high that’s something you have to tackle as an individual but typically individuals earn what their time is worth in accordance with multiple factors skillcapability specific knowledge expertise network connections wisdom and so on all of those qualifications represent an amount of time that was invested by the individual time again is the actual currencyby giving our time an exchangeable vehicle in the form of money or purchasing power we made it possible for our species to exchange our own time for the time of another’s where you may spend hours of your day to produce a tool to be used let’s say an axe you may then sell this axe to another for money where you then go and use that money to purchase bread — which would have required effort on your part to produce yourself not to mention the time and energy required to spend learning failing and refining the process to produce said goodlove for moneyso i propose a … philosophical maybe even spiritual questionif money is “the root of all evil” but money is simply a representation of our time what does that make of us and our use of timemoney is not the root of all evil money is a tool just like the axe a tool is purely neutral it has no philosophical or moral allegiancetherefore if money is neutral then the root of evil has to lie elsewhere not within the vehicle with which we give our desires physical realizationappreciating money is to appreciate time or rather the appreciation of efficient time expenditure saving money is to park your expended time for a larger purchase at a later date or to allocate funds in case of an unforeseeable expenditure or emergency whereas investing money is to sacrifice immediate gratification of a purchase and to risk providing funds to another individualgroup allowing them to use your money ergo time to act out their plans or business in exchange for a greater return on your initial investment in the futuremoney is not evil
