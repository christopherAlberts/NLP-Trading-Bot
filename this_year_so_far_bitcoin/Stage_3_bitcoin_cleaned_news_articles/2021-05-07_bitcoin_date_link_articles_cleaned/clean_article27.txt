while a vast majority of crypto enthusiasts around the globe seem to be gushing about ether eth at the moment and how its upcoming london hard fork stands to push the premier altcoin’s value even higher reports have recently surfaced that suggest bitcoin’s muchawaited taproot upgrade will go live also sometime by the end of this yearin this regard many bitcoin btc mining pools seem to already be signaling their support for the activation and as per data available on taprootwatch a website designed by core bitcoin developer hampus sjöberg taproot signaling currently accounts for about  of btc’s total hashing powerit should be mentioned that two of the largest bitcoin mining pools by hash rate — antpool and  — have been major proponents for this upgrade from the very beginning even other relatively large mining operators such as foundry usa and slush pool have also expressed their support for the activationwhat exactly is taprootin its most basic sense taproot can be thought of as the latest step in bitcoin’s evolutionary path because the upgrade seeks not only to enhance the overall usability of the network by making transactions cheaper faster and easier to deploy but also eventually allow for the deployment of smart contractsfurthermore taproot also proposes significant privacy promises — ie it seeks to make all transactions look the same to everyone except the transacting parties this potential camouflagebased framework seems as though it has been inspired by securitycentric crypto offerings available in the market today thus potentially moving bitcoin closer to some privacyfocused coins at least from a design standpointon the subject antoni trenchev cofounder and managing partner at crypto lending platform nexo told cointelegraph that the proposed taproot update is proof of bitcoin’s decentralized nature and that the network is always looking to improve and grow he also believes that the upgrade serves as a reminder to investors that unlike gold bitcoin is a dynamic store of value in every sense adding“all these admittedly major improvements pave the way for even wider bitcoin adoption and continued price appreciation in all taproot is one of btc’s most anticipated updates since the block size upgrade of ”joel edgerton chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange bitflyer usa told cointelegraph that even though most in the crypto community seem to be focused on bitcoin’s price action at the moment what they are overlooking is the fact that btc’s underlying technology is what actually gives it its value and taproot is an important development for several reasons“firstly it reduces transaction data size which could lower transaction fees for complex transactions additionally it increases privacy on multisig and timelocking wallets by making it difficult to distinguish them from simple singlesign wallets while also allowing for increased wallet functionality by allowing developers to use vaulting logic”in edgerton’s view taproot demonstrates the bitcoin community’s maturity and how everyone seems to have learned valuable lessons from the bitcoin upgrade wars of  — ie it is of utmost importance to plan and implement upgrades via the use of a decentralized communitybased voteback in  bitcoin underwent a hardfork resulting in the creation of a new cryptocurrency called bitcoin cash bch although the process was quite straightforward the period leading up to the hard fork was full of strife with many core community members clashing with one anothera technical breakdownon paper taproot is an elegant engineering solution that has been devised using proven cryptographic foundations that can help provide several evolutionary improvements to the bitcoin protocollior yaffe ceo of blockchain software company firm jelurida pointed out to cointelegraph that by combining schnorr signatures and merkelized abstract syntax trees or mast taproot is able to convert the representation of complex bitcoin transactions such as multisignature transactions and transactions used to set up a lightning channel to look just like a regular bitcoin transaction when submitted onchainin cryptography a schnorr signature is easily “provably fair” and is functionally superior to conventional logarithmic signatures which are routinely faced with intractabilityrelated issues similarly mast are unique digital offerings that allow for the deployment of various userselected conditions that must be fulfilled in order for an encumbered number of bitcoins to be spentoverall this reduces storage and can indirectly lower fees for these transaction types also in the long run when its usage becomes widespread taproot may be able to significantly improve privacy for lightning and multisignature users “from an ecosystem perspective i view taproot as an allin attempt by the bitcoin devs and community to finally make the lighting network a mainstream payment platform” yaffe addedhow will taproot affect btcanother aspect of the proposed upgrade worth considering is whether or not taproot will have any major effect on bitcoin’s future price action in this regard edgerton does not see the activation having any sort of shortterm impact on bitcoin’s value he does believe however that the “under the hood” changes that will come as a result of this update will make the bitcoin network way more functional and competitiveyaffe believes that in the long term improving lightning network adoption — ie by reducing transaction fees and settlement times — will keep bitcoin and its ecosystem as a relevant internet era payment method adding further“given that the recent surge in bitcoin price can be attributed more to its potential use as a store of value and to adoption by institutional investors i don’t expect taproot to have any meaningful shortterm price impact”lastly siddharth menon cofounder and chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange wazirx told cointelegraph that since  the latest taproot upgrade has been highly anticipated and stands to have a positive impact on the currency “slowly but steadily this network gets better every day” he addedother important aspects of taproot worth consideringper bitcoin’s community consensus the aforementioned taproot activation will only be given the green light if  of all mined blocks include an activation signal within a difficulty adjustment window  blocks more specifically the consensus agreement needs to take place during one of the difficulty epochs between now and aug  so that the network upgrade can go ahead as planned in novemberas of may  a total of  signaling blocks have emerged in the current window while miners responsible for  blocks have chosen not to include a “signal bit” the “no” votes issued by these miners currently account for  of the  blocks in the current difficulty window some pools that have so far voted against the activation include big names such as poolin binance pool
