your problem and i owe you what i owe you gokturk wrote to nelson who was asking for the money hed been promisedkeep these text messages and email records as proof i am sorry i have been avoiding you this has been the absolute worst year of my entire existence these are not excuses i just dont know what to tell you besides the truthwire is being set up right nowthe details of the correspondence are contained in a bc supreme ruling released this weeknelson a vancouver technology entrepreneur sued gokturk for breach of contract in  asking for either the amount the bitcoin was worth on the open market on feb   —  — or the amount gokturk originally agreed to paythe einstein exchange shut its doors in  after a slew of complaints an interim receiver found that the company had assets of  and debts of  million yvette brendcbcin coming to a decision justice sheila tucker found gokturk had breached a contract that concluded on june   when he sent nelson a text reading btc received thank you wire is being set up right now will send you confirmationtucker said the law required her to award nelson the amount lost at the time of the breach not the amount his bitcoin would be worth in  following recent astronomical gainsusing the date of breach to assess the damages puts the defendant in the position he would have been had the contract been fulfilled tucker wrotethe fact that  is worth more now than it was at the time of the contract does not result in an injusticeno one will lose their money herethe judgment comes a year and a half after accountants estimated that the einstein exchange had hard assets of  in cash and less than  in cryptocurrency when the court appointed an interim receiver to take control of the company on nov  the same report noted that customers were owed around  million noting nelsons lawsuit and another call from a creditor who said they were owed  million but had not yet filed a claim with the courta visual representation of the digital cryptocurrency bitcoin bitcoin has seen a massive increase in value which poses a question for judges trying to determine the value of the loss in a contract breach dan kitwoodgetty imagesgokturk spoke to the cbc in january  about a storm of online criticism that accompanied the opening of the exchange customers claimed that staff were slow to respond and expressed fear they might lose their moneyat the time gokturk claimed his team was overwhelmed by the response and demand for digital currency and promised that no one will lose their money heregokturk has filed responses to a number of bc supreme court claims in the months since the collapse of the einstein exchange arguing that he was not personally liable for agreements made with the companythe responses claim the customers signed agreements acknowledging that some digital currency exchanges had been the subject of cyberattacks that have resulted in the loss or theft of digital currencies to their users and there is a risk that a similar cyberattack could affect einsteins services and result in the theft or loss of your digital currenciesaccording to tuckers decision gokturks counsel withdrew last november after which he stopped responding to nelsons lawyer and failed to attend an examination for discoveryhe did not respond to a request for comment through linkedinwhich date do you useevan thomas a torontobased litigator with osler who specializes in digital assets and blockchain says tuckers decision is notable because its one of only a few in a growing body of canadian law to deal with disputes involving cryptocurrencyhe says its interesting to see judges treat bitcoin as property in the same way as a physical asset like a gold barthomas says courts have also had to grapple with the question of how to determine the value of a commodity that has seen such rapid shifts in worth in recent monthsa bc supreme court judge has ruled that the founder of a collapsed bitcoin exchange must pay  for breaking a contract to purchase  bitcoin david horemanscbcin the past year alone bitcoin has risen from around  cdn per unit to highs of nearly  one bitcoin was worth  cdn thursdaythis has come up before in cases about how do you value bitcoin a cryptocurrency which is a bit unique in commodities in that the prices can change quite dramatically over relatively short periods of times he saidso of course theres an obvious question which date do you usethomas says its wellsettled law that breach of contract disputes assign value at the date the breach occurred — which in gokturk and nelsons agreement was june  when the buyer actually failed to pay the money for the bitcointhe decision says nelson doesnt know whether gokturk sold the  bitcoin and if he still has any or all of it in his possessionthomas says its easy to see how nelson might feel out of pocket by  million even if gokturk pays the courtordered amountbut had bitcoin dropped in value instead of soaring in the interim thomas says nelson likely would not have asked for  worthless bitcoin as compensationthe law says it youre going to make that argument when the price goes down you have to live by the same argument if the price goes up thomas saidwe can all disagree on whether thats fair or not but thats just what the law is
