high level of user trust something which traditional fintech still struggles to achieve” edwards sayswhat are the challenges facing the defi sectorthat being said defi is still in its infancy there are still challenges to overcome including a lack of understanding around defi and how it operates“moreover there are an array of decentralised platforms which differ in quality and reliability” says edwards “users have also been subject to ineffectual platforms regressive technologies and in some cases scams”however he adds companies like his own are wellsuited to address these challenges “we have assembled a highly qualified team with an established track record and deep expertise in the defi crypto and digital asset management sectors” edwards says“using our contacts and expertise we will successfully identify and invest in projects that we deem to be reliable and efficacious as such we are not only helping innovate the defi ecosystem but we are also providing investors with a
