the millennial members of my family frequently bombard me with unsolicited advice about cryptocurrency they’re enraptured with crypto and they’re puzzled as to why i haven’t jumped onto the bandwagonso where does a cantankerous skeptic like me stand on cryptocurrency let’s take a break from the market’s daily upsanddowns to address the hot topic of crypto we’ll start with the views of warren buffett and charlie munger two of the most successful investors on the planetberkshire hathaway’s nyse brka brkb  annual shareholders meeting took place on saturday may  the annual meeting is often referred to as “the woodstock of capitalism”i watched last saturday’s event as it was live streamed on the internet instead of the usual location of omaha it was held this year in los angeles because of the pandemic berkshire hathaway chairman and ceo warren buffett and vice chairman charlie munger were bullish about the overall economy’s prospects but they took the opportunity to harshly criticize cryptocurrencyin particular munger attacked bitcoin btc during the berkshire meeting calling it “disgusting” and “contrary to the interests of civilization” he said cryptocurrencies in general are “useful to kidnappers and extortionists”generation crypto…many hipster entrepreneurs would beg to differ a highly vocal proponent of crypto is elon musk ceo and founder of electric vehicle maker tesla nsdq tsla musk has made substantial investments in bitcoin and his company now accepts it as payment for products we’ll see if the eccentric billionaire stars in a cryptothemed sketch when he hosts saturday night live on may read this story elon musk and the bitcoin buzz explaineda quick refresher course cryptocurrency is digital currency a type of money that lives only on the internet created in  by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym satoshi nakamoto bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and it remains the largestpeople with an antiestablishment procrypto sensibility spawned by the  financial crisis are often referred to as “generation crypto” or gen c some of these digital rebels also call themselves “cyberpunks” i’m already bracing myself for the inevitable hate mail“altcoins” are crypto alternatives to bitcoin and they’re proliferating at a rapid rate bitcoin and altcoins are decentralized and unregulated meaning that no bank not even the federal reserve can control how many coins are in circulation or set new rules the number of coins is strictly limited by math with the number growing at a steady but slowing rateevery cryptocurrency is supposed to be linked to a “blockchain” which is a distributed computergenerated database of all transactions that have ever taken place in the currency altcoins share characteristics with bitcoin but are distinct in certain ways for example some altcoins use a different consensus mechanism on the blockchain to validate transactionsbitcoin and altcoins are dependent upon a highly encrypted algorithm which at least theoretically makes them impossible to manipulatean increasing number of major businesses are accepting crypto as payment analysts estimate more than  cryptocurrencies are currently in existence the values of bitcoin and the major altcoins have been soaring see chartas you can see cryptocurrencies are racking up exponential gains but the frenzy reminds me of internet stocks in  when the valuations of inherently weak companies reached nosebleed heights back then analysts assured investors that lack of revenue and earnings didn’t matter because the technology was so compelling we know how that turned out the dotcom bubble burst in given all the recent revelations about cyber hacking and the surveillance state we seem to live in it’s not hard to see why bitcoin and altcoins would appeal to some people crypto isn’t subject to the whims of central bank policies and remains next to impossible to confiscate resulting in a more secure store of value supposedly than goldregardless i look askance at cryptocurrencies their volatile price gyrations undermine their credibility as currencies real currencies typically have relatively stable values making them reliable units of exchangewhat’s worse cryptocurrencies aren’t as secure as they claim the optimists say cryptocurrencies are highly secure the pessimists disagree reports have surfaced of several thefts of cryptocoins from encrypted accountscryptocurrencies also operate under the constant threat of a newer “disruptive” technology coming along to make them suddenly obsoleteand few people truly understand how cryptocurrencies work they’re wrapped in technojargon and seem to operate in nebulous ways one of the sacred rules of investing is to never put your money into an investment you don’t understandcryptocurrencies don’t represent anything tangible they’re worth money because of the cultlike faith of their adherents several credible wall street analysts have referred to cryptocurrencies as “ponzi schemes”one potential risk is that governments including our own could move to outlaw these currencies in  china officially banned all cryptorelated commercial activities a reminder that cryptocurrencies exist by the grace of government acquiescenceunless you have a strong stomach for volatility and potentially big losses there are better and safer places to put your money if you’re determined to profit from the crypto craze consider “pickandshovel” plays on the underlying technologymoneymaking potential lies in the private enterprise market for blockchains
