a lincolnshire man has warned people to be careful and do their research before investing in cryptocurrency after he lost £ on his credit cardcraig e in his  first became interested in the stock market and the viral craze of cryptocurrency when seeing a social media frenzy about virtual currencies and the power platforms hold over the stock marketcryptocurrency is a digital means of exchange that operates without the backing of an authority such as a bank or governmentthey are entirely online sort of like virtual tokens and all transactions are noted on something called blockchain technology a type of database that is essentially a public forum of all crypto transactionsread more what is cryptocurrency an article by forbesupon entering the world of cryptocurrency craig was influenced by the work of social media platform reddit whose users had pushed the growth of a memebased cryptocurrency known as dogecoin“i wouldn’t have gotten in to crypto or at least alt coins if it hadn’t been for the virility of them” craig said“dogecoin has drawn lots of attention and it’s kind of a gateway for those who are bored and want to make a quick buck“i am sure many people have made a lot of money but there’s also lots of people like myself who have lost money and never really had the chance to make it”craig had naturally been drawn to bitcoin as a choice of currency but the large value  bitcoin is worth over £ put him off so he instead opted for a cheaper alternative in safemoonafter putting small amounts of money into safemoon he saw instant results and his investment’s value soared four times within dayshe was told by other users that the figure would only rise and upon believing them craig was encouraged to use his credit card as it would “easily double and pay back the very next day”with that in mind craig bought £ worth of the tokens on safemoon but his story did not have a fairytale endingthe very next day his investment was worthless this is either due to people quickly selling to drop the price or the liquidity being taken away also known as rug pullingcraig managed to salvage £ from his initial investment but the rest disappearedhe acknowledges that he maybe wasn’t as prepared as he should have been but also likens the cryptocurrency community to that of a ponzi scheme“you are encouraged in the telegram groups for the coins to shill – encourage more people to invest and drive the price up but in reality if that happens those who were in earlier sell to recoup losses or make profit it does almost feel like a ponzi scheme“a lot of it is my own fault i should have known better than to risk money i didn’t have and i should have been more cautious and did research with my potential investments“but the prevalence on social media the echo chambers and even the attention in mainstream media outlet lulled me in to a sense of security and i thought i would be in double my money overnight and get out”craig urged people not to end up like him and to do their research before investing“i wouldn’t suggest people to not invest in stocks or cryptocurrency but to fully evaluate the potential investment do research in to them and be sure that you’re investing something you believe in and if you’re a casual investor invest in something for the ‘long term’ growth it could offer“for cryptocurrency stay to centralised exchanges like binance and don’t put any serious money in to cryptocurrency that are a joke and again do your research“finally never invest money you couldn’t afford to lose i did and it’s devastating i’ve learnt the lesson the hard way don’t follow my footsteps”
