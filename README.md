 # What is this divination called NLP, and how to use it's awesome power!
 
 NLP stands for Natural language processing. Not to be confused with Neuro-linguistic programming which is a whole other kind of foodoo. Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The question NLP sets out to awnser is, are computers capable of "understanding" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. Thanks to a lot of research and leaps in recent developments, the awnser to this question is Yes!
